Whether you’re looking to improve aerodynamics, reduce weight, or simply improve the ride feel of your bike, there are lots of great options to suit every need and preference. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, having all those options can make deciding which road bike wheels to buy a challenge, especially when every brand and model claims to be better than the next. And, the rapid evolution of road bike wheels in recent years means that choosing the right wheels has gotten even more confusing than it used to be. Carbon, aluminum, disc brake, rim brake, rim depth, rim width, hookless tubeless, hooked tubeless, or clincher? There are so many options these days it could make your head spin.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help provide some clarity, we’ve tested a huge selection of the best road bike wheels on the market to provide honest feedback about how they perform in the real world. Each set of wheels was tested by review author Bennett Shane or another member of our editorial team. Over hundreds of miles of riding, we examined and scrutinized each model’s performance while considering important factors like weight, stiffness, stability, vibration damping, aerodynamics, tire compatibility, and overall build quality. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re a climber looking for a snappy and feathery set of low-profile rims, a breakaway addict looking for a set of “deeps” to save every watt of drag possible, or a roadie with an uncanny knack for getting lost on gravel, we’ve tested many of the most popular models and some lesser known newcomers to help you decide on this crucial upgrade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the models we’ve tested, we zeroed in on our favorites which are listed below, followed by the best of the rest which are also great options we feel are worthy of consideration.

2023. So, it’s safe to assume their latest road wheels, including the brilliant <a href=\"https://mikes-bikes.sjv.io/c/2227671/987441/12988?subId1=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fmikesbikes.com%2Fproducts%2Freserve-40-44-road-wheelset\">40|44 DT 350</a> wheels, are fast enough for the rest of us. While the 40|44 are speedy and efficient, Reserve touts comfort as the most compelling attribute, and we strongly agree. These are the most buttery-smooth and pleasant carbon wheels we tested and are an ideal choice for racking up big miles on any road, from minty fresh tarmac to aged and weathered pavement, even dirt and hardpack gravel. With internal rim widths of 25 mm in front and 25.5mm in the rear, they are optimized for tires no smaller than 28mm, all the way up to 45mm, making them a solid choice for those with all-road intentions. </p><p></p><p>Another reason to love the 40|44 and all Reserve wheels is the choice of pricing, based on the hub spec. Our test set featured the workhorse DT Swiss 350 Staightpull hubs, and retail for $1799. The DT 350 packs a huge amount of performance, reliability, and serviceability into the 40|44 while allowing the weight to remain respectable at just over 1500g with tubeless tape and valves installed. At an additional cost, Reserve also offers the 40|44 with DT Swiss 240 (1445g) and DT 180 (1381g) hubs for weight savings, but realistically, hubs are about reliability and quick cassette engagement, both of which the 350 has covered and then some. </p><p></p><p>As the name denotes, the 40|44 are a mixed-depth wheelset, meaning the front rim is shallower than the rear. Reserve designs all of their road wheels this way because, in reality, the demands and conditions affecting front and rear wheels are slightly different. Up front, turbulent air is hitting a lighter wheel that is bearing far less of the rider’s weight and is free to rotate along with the fork. So, the shallower 40mm rim offers more stability because it catches less airflow. The taller 44mm rear rim makes for a slightly stiffer wheel build, for more responsive acceleration. Bearing more of the rider’s weight, shielded from the wind by the rider’s lower body and locked into the rear triangle of the bike, the rear wheel is much less of a liability in blustery conditions, so there’s no downside to the increased depth.</p><p></p><p>Straightpull spokes are another great choice for this wheelset, allowing for very high spoke tension, which creates plenty of responsiveness during accelerations and lateral stiffness during aggressive maneuvering. </p><p></p><p>Reserve also made the 40|44 easy to get along with. The hooked tubeless-ready rims are compatible with any tubeless tire or clinchers run with tubes. DT Swiss’ hubs are reliable and easy to service. There is also no weight limit and Reserve offers a lifetime warranty and crash replacement discount for added peace of mind to protect your investment. And, our experience with Reserve’s warranty department has always been good. </p><p></p><p>While other wheels might stand out more in certain situations, the <a href=\"https://mikes-bikes.sjv.io/c/2227671/987441/12988?subId1=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fmikesbikes.com%2Fproducts%2Freserve-40-44-road-wheelset\">Reserve 40|44</a> is a super capable all-arounder that has you covered on any ride, pace, surface, or distance. At $1799 US, they are moderately priced (compared to some premium options) and a great performance and comfort upgrade for any disc brake road bike.</p><p></p><p>Read our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/reserve-40-44-road-wheels-review/\">full review of the Reserve 40|44 Road Wheels</a>.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://mikes-bikes.sjv.io/c/2227671/987441/12988?subId1=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fmikesbikes.com%2Fproducts%2Freserve-40-44-road-wheelset\">Check Price at Mike's Bikes</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Value Carbon Road Bike Wheels\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=26829&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.huntbikewheels.com%2Fproducts%2Fhunt-44-aerodynamicist-carbon-disc-wheelset\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHunt 44 Aerodynamicist Carbon Disc\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$1,279</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1528g (including tape, valves, and rotor lock rings)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tubeless</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes, Hooked Tubeless</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Ri Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Carbon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Brake Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Disc, Centerlock</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Depth</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>44mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>20mm internal / 29mm external</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hunt-44-Aerodynamicist.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"996\" height=\"664\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hunt-44-Aerodynamicist.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Wheels of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hunt-44-Aerodynamicist.jpeg 996w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hunt-44-Aerodynamicist-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hunt-44-Aerodynamicist-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hunt-44-Aerodynamicist-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hunt-44-Aerodynamicist-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hunt-44-Aerodynamicist-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Affordable for carbon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>All the freehub body options</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Come with rotor lock rings, tape and valves</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Great ride quality</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Quick engagment</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Test wheels trapped water inside</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>240 lbs weight limit</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Hunt Bike Wheels have made a name for themselves and become synonymous with value in the cycling wheel market.

This depth strikes a good middle ground between super-deep aero rims and shallower rims where they still slice through the air efficiently but avoid getting pushed around in variable winds. The hooked rims are 20mm wide internally and 29mm wide externally, and Hunt claims they are aero-optimized for use with 25c-28c tires. That said, they should work with any tires between 23-50mm as the hooked rim is compatible with tubeless-ready tires or clinchers with a tube. </p><p></p><p>The rims are laced with straight-pull aero spokes to Hunt hubs with center lock brake rotor interfaces, plus they come with rotor lock rings, which is a nice touch. The freehub features three pawls and a 48-tooth ratchet for quick 7.5-degree engagement. Hunt has also accounted for all freehub styles, and you can pick between Shimano HG, SRAM XDR, Campagnolo, and Campagnolo N3W (Ekar), so drivetrain compatibility shouldn’t be an issue. They also include a spacer for 8/9/10 speed cassettes along with a few spare spokes, nipples, and washers.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the build, the performance of the 44 Aerodynamicist is also great. They feel lighter than their weight suggests when climbing and getting on the gas, yet reassuringly stable at speed and generally unfazed when subject to crosswinds. They also provide a good amount of comfort over less-than-perfect road surfaces like weathered pavement or the occasional detour down a gravel road. They also look fantastic, with a matte black finish and subtle logos that look classy and will go with any bike build. </p><p></p><p>At $1,279, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=26829&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.huntbikewheels.com%2Fproducts%2Fhunt-44-aerodynamicist-carbon-disc-wheelset\">Hunt 44 Aerodynamicist</a> still are no drop in the bucket, but they’re hundreds less than most moderately priced carbon road wheels. On top of that, Hunt offers a 3-year warranty and riders can purchase the <a href=\"https://us.huntbikewheels.com/products/h_care-lifetime-crash-replacement-carbon-wheels\">H_Care</a> lifetime crash replacement policy for $69. They also have a 60-day Ride and Return Policy, so you try these wheels with confidence knowing that you’re not committed if you don’t happen to like them. But, you probably will because these are excellent wheels, especially for the price. </p><p></p><p>Read our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-hunt-aerodynamicist-44-aero-road-bike-wheels/\">full review of the Hunt 44 Aerodynamicist Carbon Disc wheels</a>. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=26829&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.huntbikewheels.com%2Fproducts%2Fhunt-44-aerodynamicist-carbon-disc-wheelset\">Check Price at Hunt Bike Wheels</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Carbon Disc Climbing Wheels\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.cadex-cycling.com/us/cadex-36-disc-tubeless\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCadex 36 Disc Tubeless\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$2500/set (or $1400/front and $1800/rear)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1354g (including tape and valves)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tubeless</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes, Hookless</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rim material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Carbon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Brake Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Disc, Centerlock</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Depth</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>36mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>22.4mm internal / 26mm external</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Cadex-36-disc-tubeless.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"770\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Cadex-36-disc-tubeless.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Wheels of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Cadex-36-disc-tubeless.jpeg 770w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Cadex-36-disc-tubeless-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Cadex-36-disc-tubeless-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Cadex-36-disc-tubeless-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Cadex-36-disc-tubeless-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Incredibly responsive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Predictable and confident handling</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Comfortable ride</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tire choice is limited to hookless tubeless only</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>If you aren’t familiar, Cadex is the component division of Giant Bicycles, and they produce a wide range of bike parts and accessories including premium wheels like the <a href=\"https://www.cadex-cycling.com/us/cadex-36-disc-tubeless\">Cadex 36 Disc</a>. Given their reputation for delivering exceptional performance and featuring the specs to support that, we were excited to see how good they really are. </p><p></p><p>Big Gains for Big Days is the Why behind the 36 Disc, according to Cadex. At 1354g with tape and valves installed, the Cadex 36 is an impressively light wheelset but delivers more than just uphill speed. With a 22.4 internal width and a hookless rim, the Cadex 36 Disc are also optimized for running bigger tires at lower pressure, which makes big days on the bike less exhausting through improved rolling efficiency and enhanced comfort. </p><p></p><p>High tensile strength carbon spokes are a big part of the weight savings achieved in the Cadex 36 Disc but also make for an incredibly stiff and responsive wheel. The spokes are bladed for improved aerodynamics and stability in windy conditions. Cadex’s own R1-C30 low-friction hubs feature precision-machined internals and ceramic bearings which they claim roll up to 50% more smoothly than steel hub bearings. Additionally, Cadex uses what they call “Custom-Tuned Dynamic Balanced Lacing” to achieve a wider bracing angle and higher spoke tension to bolster stiffness and responsiveness.</p><p></p><p>Setup was quick and easy as the wheels come with tubeless tapes and valves installed. Tires seated easily with just a floor pump, but be aware that the Cadex 36 Disc rim is hookless, so it is absolutely critical to run compatible hookless approved tires. No clincher tires are compatible with hookless rims, and a fair number of “tubeless-ready” tires are not compatible with hookless rims, either, so it’s best to do some research prior to choosing your rubber. (They are currently selling the wheels as a set with tires included for $2,500)</p><p></p><p>“Big gains” is something that can be felt from the first pedal stroke. The Cadex 36 spin up very easily and hold speed incredibly well uphill. Stomping on the pedals, the lateral rigidity reminds one of a deeper rim, but with the responsiveness and zest of a wheel this light. Whether tapping out a deliberate, measured cadence or dropping the hammer, these wheels are happy to do whatever you please. And despite their stiffness, at 36mm deep, the Cadex 36 do still offer some forgiveness over road chatter, cracks, and bumps in the road. Handling at all speeds is predictable, precise, and they feel stable at speed and virtually unaffected by crosswinds. </p><p></p><p>While it can certainly be hard to justify the premium price tag of the Cadex 36 wheels at $1,400 and $1,800 for the front and rear, respectively, they are currently being sold for $2,500 as a set with a pair of Cadex tires. While that clearly isn’t inexpensive, it’s an easier pill to swallow and even undercuts the price of several other premium wheelsets. And, Cadex’s Composite Confidence Guarantee covers damage for the first two years, along with a 5-year warranty against manufacturing defects. </p><p></p><p>So, if you’re looking for some light, stiff, and classy-looking wheels to help make hills feel flatter, the <a href=\"https://www.cadex-cycling.com/us/cadex-36-disc-tubeless\">Cadex 36</a> is worth a serious look. They don’t come cheap but these wheels offer premium performance for those seeking the best.</p><p></p><p>Read our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cadex-36-wheels-premium-performance-at-a-premium-price/\">full review of the Cadex 36 Disc wheels</a>.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.cadex-cycling.com/us/cadex-36-disc-tubeless\">Check Price at Cadex Cycling</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest All-Around Aluminum Road Bike Wheels\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66154X1653891&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.specialized.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Falpinist-slx-disc%2Fp%2F218349%3Fcolor%3D353087-218349\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRoval Aplinist SLX Disc\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$800</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1485g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tubeless</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes, Hooked Tubeless Ready</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rim material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Aluminum</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Brake Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Disc, Centerlock</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Depth</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>24mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>20mm internal / 23.5mm external</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-Disc.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1097\" height=\"731\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-Disc.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Wheels of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-Disc.jpeg 1097w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-Disc-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-Disc-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-Disc-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-Disc-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-Disc-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Excellent hubs</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Great handling</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Comfortable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Reasonably lightweight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Could be wider</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Roval touts the<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66154X1653891&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.specialized.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Falpinist-slx-disc%2Fp%2F218349%3Fcolor%3D353087-218349\"> Alpinist SLX</a> as the best aluminum wheelset the company has ever produced for road riding. By combining tubeless ready rims laced to excellent DT Swiss 350 hubs with Sapim spokes and nipples, they’ve created a respectably lightweight wheelset that does everything well. At $800, the Alpinist SLX sits at a price point a few hundred dollars below entry-level carbon fiber wheels, which in many cases are less inspiring to ride than premium aluminum, being heavier or built with lower-quality hubs.  </p><p></p><p>The Alpinist SLX  rim is made from 6061 aluminum aluminum alloy with a shot-peened finish. The rim is a hooked and tubeless-ready design with a moderate internal width of 20mm and an external width of 23.5mm that will work great with tires from 25 to 30c. While a touch narrower than what is quickly becoming the norm, these rims still work great with the vast majority of tires <em>most people</em> are using for pure road riding. That said, the Alpinist SLX rim still manages to feel plush and maneuverable, especially when set up tubeless with 30c rubber. With aluminum rims and a lightweight overall build, it’s critical to choose the best tires, otherwise, the ride quality and rolling resistance will be less than ideal. And, being a more affordable aluminum option, it leaves room in the budget to upgrade tires as well. </p><p></p><p>Moving away from the rim, it’s clear that Roval was committed to making intelligent choices in selecting the parts for the Alpinist SLX wheelset, making them as well-rounded as some more expensive custom-built wheels. First, we find Sapim D-Light spokes, which aren’t the lightest or most aero spokes, but do enhance the ride quality of the Alpinist SLX. Those are laced to the legendary DT Swiss 350 hub with a 36-tooth star ratchet system for solid 10-degree engagement under power. The DT 350 is also one of the most reliable and easily serviced hubs ever produced.</p><p></p><p>Setting up the Alpinist SLX tubeless was fairly easy, with both tape and tubeless valves supplied inside the box. We did need to use an air compressor to pop the tire beads into place, but once that was done, the tires held air perfectly. </p><p></p><p>On the road, the Alpinist SLX were pleasant to ride at a steady pace across any terrain. Only during the most extreme maneuvers and accelerations was it evident that they weren’t quite as stiff and snappy as some carbon options we tested.

With a great design and all-around performance, the aluminum-rimmed Ardennes avoid many of the compromises and shortcomings of carbon fiber rim brake models that cost significantly more.   </p><p></p><p>The “Black” in HED Ardennes RA Black is a reference to its namesake, the textured black braking surface that features “Turbine Braking Technology”. The main benefit of Turbine Braking Technology is that the textured surface dramatically reduces stopping distances and the force required at the brake lever, which is of particular importance when running rim brakes. HED makes some lofty promises that these wheels will stop up to 25% faster in dry conditions and as much as 70% faster in wet conditions compared to other rim brake wheels with carbon brake tracks. The other obvious benefit is that the black brake track looks super stealthy, just like carbon rims, but without the concerns around heat buildup at the brake track, and poor wet-weather braking performance.</p><p></p><p>While controlling your speed is obviously super-critical, these wheels are also focused on ride quality and performance. The rims themselves are designed and constructed to provide a comfortable yet lively ride with an internal width of 21mm that is well suited to pure road riding tire widths between 23 and 30c. Unlike disc brake wheels, brake track width and tire volume are more of a consideration, and here the HED Ardennes hit the sweet spot.  </p><p></p><p>Those rims are laced to HED HU216 (f) and Sonic 545 (r) hubs with Sapim CX-Ray bladed spokes. The front wheel uses straight pull spokes and radial lacing while the rear uses J-bend spokes in a 2x cross pattern. These spokes are light, aerodynamic, and provide a great ride quality in addition to being relatively easy to find should you need to replace one. And, in our experience with HED Ardennes wheels, you may never need to replace one or even true your wheels. The 5-pawl freehub engages quickly, and while it has a somewhat aggressive freewheeling sound, it isn’t over the top.</p><p></p><p>HED includes tubeless rim tape with the wheels, but you’ll need valve stems to complete the system which they sell separately for $15 a pop on their site in a range of lengths. Outside of that, setting up tires proved to be super easy and only required the use of a floor pump. </p><p></p><p>On the road, the HED Ardennes RA Black feel efficient and comfortable and not far off from more expensive deep-section carbon hoops. Super discerning riders might feel a slight reduction in efficiency, but the ride quality, responsiveness, and comfort these wheels provide over rough pavement is hard to ignore. Likewise, the rim brake stopping power is the best we’ve ever experienced, competitive in power and modulation to hydraulic disc brakes.</p><p></p><p>So, if you’re not convinced that carbon fiber rims or disc brakes are for you, the <a href=\"https://hedcycling.com/products/ardennes-ra-black-rim-brake?variant=44951618879778\">HED Ardennes RA Black</a> is our top recommendation. While $1,300 isn’t exactly cheap, they cost less than most carbon options while providing a nicely balanced ride quality, excellent stopping power, and good looks.</p><p></p><p>Read our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hed-ardennes-ra-black-high-performance-aluminum-hoops-for-rim-brakes/\">full review of the HED Ardennes RA Black</a> wheels. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://hedcycling.com/products/ardennes-ra-black-rim-brake?variant=44951618879778\">Check Price at HED Cycling Products</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Climbing Road Bike Wheels for Rim Brakes\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://ridehifi.com/shop/ep30-sl-carbon-rim-brake-clinchers/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHiFi EP30 SL Rim Brake Carbon Clinchers\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$1970</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1320g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tubeless</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes.

Since bike racing is about going fast, it’s no surprise that HiFi remains committed to offering high-end rim-brake wheelsets, like the <a href=\"https://ridehifi.com/shop/ep30-sl-carbon-rim-brake-clinchers/\">EP30 SL</a>. </p><p></p><p>Setting up the EP30 SL with tubeless tires was a cinch, thanks to nice and sticky tubeless tape that only requires one layer, and high-quality tubeless valves, which are included with purchase. Since the EP30 SL rim is hooked, you can run any tire under the sun with or without an innertube, which we love and applaud. While the rim is hooked, the hook is less pronounced than traditional clincher rims, a design HiFi terms “micro-hook”. The benefits are the tire security and compatibility of a traditional hooked design, with a more advanced rim/tire interface that allows the tire to better protect the top edge of the brake track from impacts with potholes and other road debris.</p><p></p><p>The EP30 SL’s 19/25mm internal/external width is a bit narrower than most road wheels being developed at present. Keeping in mind that the tires must safely clear rim brake calipers and narrow parts of the frame and fork, 19/25mm is a smart choice from a compatibility standpoint. Thanks to a ride quality that balances stiffness with a good amount of compliance, we found that with 25c and 28c rubber installed, the EP30 SL had a nice balance of speed and comfort, and allowed the tire to grip confidently at all times. </p><p></p><p>At 1320 grams, the EP30 SL is an ideal choice for hilly terrain, but far away from a niche wheelset for pure climbers. Not only were the 395g rims quick to spin up, but the 30mm deep profile was tenacious at high speed, helping us bomb down descents and charge across flat terrain like much deeper options. The EP30 SL rim offers plenty of stiffness, providing pinpoint maneuverability and surefooted confidence with the bike leaning through fast turns. Climbing on them is special, though. We set numerous personal best times on local climbs that we’ve ridden dozens of times while testing these wheels. </p><p></p><p>The braking performance of the EP30 SL rim was excellent, with zero shuttering, squealing, or brake fade. While we don’t recommend any carbon brake track wheel for day-in and day-out riding in wet and grimy conditions, we can confirm that the EP30 SL is ready to descend aggressively and ride in traffic with total confidence, in dry and slightly damp conditions. They also come with carbon-specific brake pads that we found to work great for slowing down in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>The EP30 HiFi Fidelity R36SL straight pull hubs feature high-quality Japanese steel bearings and use a 4-pawl system engaging with a 36-tooth ring. The R36SL hubs offer quick and reliable engagement, lightweight, and long-term dependability. The R36SL hubs are laced by hand to the EP30 SL rim with Sapim CX-Ray <em>straight pull</em> spokes. and Sapim Secure Lock Alloy nipples. The front wheel features an 18-spoke radial lacing pattern, while the rear utilizes a 24-hole 2:1 lacing pattern with 16 spokes on the drive side and 8 on the non-drive. </p><p></p><p>In the case of major incidents, HiFi offers a generous crash replacement policy that provides a 50% off MSRP discount on any wheel and necessary parts that are structurally damaged in a crash or accident. HiFi also guarantees their wheels to be free of manufacturing defects for 24 months from the date of purchase by the original owner. </p><p></p><p>At $1970, the <a href=\"https://ridehifi.com/shop/ep30-sl-carbon-rim-brake-clinchers/\">HiFi EP30 SL </a>is a significant investment but will have you setting new personal bests and keep your beloved rim brake race

Trimax 35 DB CL</a> wheelset represents an affordable upgrade in aerodynamics and lateral stiffness, making it a great choice for those just getting into road racing or time-trialing. </p><p></p><p>The Trimax 35 rim features a slightly more aggressive 35mm depth and material is milled away around the spokes nipples, ensuring a race-worthy strength-to-weight ratio and creating a striking aesthetic. While Vision offers no specific aerodynamic claims about the Trimax 35 rim, it’s documented that deeper rims provide an advantage when riding at higher speed, by giving the air more surface to flow across, thus reducing the turbulence and aero drag that slows the rim down.</p><p></p><p>The rim is wide enough across the spoke bed to work well with 28c tires but for the best aerodynamics, a 25c tire is ideal and will create a smooth transition from the rim to the tire sidewall. Thankfully, the Vision Trimax 35 is tubeless ready, so those smaller 25c tires will still be comfortable and fast-rolling because they can be run at lower pressure without a tube inside. </p><p></p><p>While the Trimax 35 DB CL wheelset isn’t a featherweight option at 1650 grams, when set up tubeless and paired with a lightweight and supple tire, it’s a fast set of wheels. The deeper rim and shorter spokes react with vigor to sudden spikes in power. The only thing that holds these wheels back a bit at times is the 3-pawl freehub, which takes a moment to engage the rear wheel during sudden accelerations, which we found most noticeable when climbing. Once the climbing is done, the Trimax 35 wheels are more than ready to rip descents, corners, and long flat stretches of open road. </p><p></p><p>We were honestly quite pleasantly surprised by the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66154X1653891&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradeinn.com%2Fbikeinn%2Fen%2Fvision-trimax-35-cl-disc-road-wheel-set%2F139090816%2Fp%3FqueryID%3D1096f1bf01db7b32d6dac3e2d65ae6e5%26buscador_search\">Vision Trimax 35 DB CL</a> given their reasonable cost of just $550. Sometimes it’s easy to get swept up in all the latest and greatest tech when testing the best of the best.

These also happen to be the first road wheels made with <em>Fusion Fiber</em>, a US-made carbon fiber that has previously been applied in both gravel and mountain bike wheels. Built around Chris King’s excellent R45D hubs, these hookless tubeless wheels come at a premium price but back that up with amazing craftsmanship, stellar ride quality, and an outstanding lifetime warranty. </p><p></p><p>One of the standout features of the ARD44 wheels is the Fusion Fiber rims. Made in Utah by CSS Composites, Fusion Fiber has been used by Forge+Bond and in Chris King’s other recent complete GRD and MTN wheelsets. Using a thermoplastic resin, Fusion Fiber is not only recyclable but claims to absorb vibration better than traditional carbon fiber as well. On the road, the comfort is readily apparent as they soak up road buzz and impact as well as any other wheels we’ve tried. That smoothness translates directly to grip and rolling efficiency since everything seems less affected by imperfections in the road surface, handling is super calm and predictable, and the wheels are surprisingly quiet and damp sounding too (other than the freehub).</p><p></p><p>With a 44mm depth, the ARD44 rims offer a moderate level of aero advantage, which is enhanced by the hookless design for a smoother transition at the rim-tire interface. Despite the 44mm depth, we found them to be impressively stable in crosswinds where some deep section rims can feel sketchy. In varying winds, they did not waver or get pushed around and felt more similar to shallower designs. The hookless design and 25mm internal/30.5mm external width have been “aerodynamically tailored for 28mm-30mm tires”, meaning tires of those sizes will be the most aero-efficient. That said, they are claimed to work with tires up to 47mm wide, meaning they also have your all-road and gravel needs covered.</p><p></p><p>At the center of those rims are Chris King R45D hubs which are made in their factory in Portland, OR. These stunning hubs are available in a range of color options, have a center lock brake rotor interface, and can be purchased with Shimano HG, SRAM XDR, or Shimano Microspline freehub bodies. The house-made stainless steel bearings are ultra-smooth (plus you can upgrade to ceramic for $110) and feature King’s <em>RingDrive</em> system which has 45 points of simultaneous engagement, or 8°, for a zesty, precise feel. Twenty-four bladed, J-bend Sapim CX-Ray spokes connect the rims and hubs together.</p><p></p><p>At 1525g, the ARD44 isn’t the lightest wheelset around, but what little additional weight they have goes virtually unnoticed on the road, much the same way that cracked and weathered pavement seems to disappear beneath you. Should you manage to damage your wheels, Chris King’s Lifetime Warranty has your back, and they really mean it. If you damage your rim, they will pay for shipping both ways, a new rim and rebuild, plus a hub service. It doesn’t get much better than that. </p><p></p><p>At $2850, the ARD44 wheelset is well within premium-priced wheelset territory. While they aren’t the lightest, they offer a beautiful ride quality through their Fusion Fiber rims, bombproof Chris King hubs, excellent craftsmanship, and attention to detail.

Most notably, the 303 has become even more versatile, by adding width and adopting a hookless rim profile. While that does limit you to fewer compatible tires, the hookless design actually opens up more possibilities for the 303, as an “all-road” wheelset, capable of being fast, smooth, and comfortable while standing up to abuse from unruly and unpaved roads. </p><p></p><p>A hookless rim is an interesting choice for a wheelset so steeped in road heritage, as the technology was first developed for mountain bike rims before becoming commonplace on gravel and cyclocross-focused designs. While it is true that tire options become limited with hookless rims, nearly all leading brands now offer a road tire that is hookless compatible. For a sampling of these, check out our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-best-road-bike-tires/\">Buyer’s Guide to the Best Road Bike Tires of 2024</a>. </p><p></p><p>For a road wheelset, the primary claimed benefit of hookless is the more aerodynamic and efficient profile that the tire assumes when installed. By smoothing the transition from rim to tire, airflow is less disrupted and the rim itself is less exposed to impact. Additionally, manufacturers claim the rim itself can be kept lighter without adding hooks. Yet despite these claimed advantages, there are plenty of riders who are opposed to hookless rims in road riding.</p><p></p><p>So, how does this new-school philosophy in rim design affect the ride characteristics of the 303 Firecrest? When paired with 28c tires (the minimum volume that is compatible, according to Zipp) and inflated to 70 PSI, the 303 Firecrest feels so smooth, that it takes some getting used to. On a few occasions during the first ride, we were compelled to look down to ensure there wasn’t a puncture. In reality, the 303 Firecrest and the wider tires were doing their job in perfect harmony, soaking up road buzz and decreasing rolling resistance, which in turn preserves more speed and more energy in the rider, a win-win! While that level of smoothness doesn’t always translate well to cornering, we found it felt natural, confident, and precise. This is due to the 30mm external rim width, which prevents the tire from deforming under the lateral force generated by leaning the bike into a turn. </p><p></p><p>Climbing, the 303’s low weight was readily apparent, and they made easy work of even double-digit gradients. The rear hub’s 66-point engagement helps here as there is no lag when your cadence drops or pedaling gets choppy. At high speed, the 40mm deep rim was surprisingly efficient, reminiscent of a rim with greater depth. With the 303 Firecrest, it’s easier to hold onto higher speeds, because the entire wheel and tire (+ bike and rider) system is suspended more efficiently above the road, so the road is essentially smoothed out, and watts are thereby saved.</p><p></p><p>Testing this wheelset wasn’t as much an “ah-ha” as an “uh-huh”, as the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fzipp-303-firecrest-carbon-disc-brake-wheel-tubeless\">303 Firecrest </a>has been and will remain on the short list of the best-performing road wheels available. Zipp realizes that their bread and butter – aerodynamics – has hit a plateau in development, and smartly pivoted to rolling resistance to stay ahead of the pack with the 303 Firecrest. At $2046, they are actually competitively priced compared to many top-tier models. It’s a hard wheelset to look away from and was even harder to send back to Zipp.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fzipp-303-firecrest-carbon-disc-brake-wheel-tubeless\">Check Price at Backcountry</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F233471%2Fbontrager-aeolus-pro-49v-disc-tlr-road-wheel\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBontrager Aeolus Pro 49V Disc TLR\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$1,800</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1555g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tubeless</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes.

Bontrager’s use of <em>OCLV NEXT thermoplastic carbon</em> makes the Aeolus Pro 49V rim more durable and better able to dampen vibrations, resulting in a lower rolling resistance for a smoother and faster wheelset. The aerodynamically-optimized 25mm internal width rim is ideal for pairing with higher volume road tires size 28c and above. Because of the added width, the Aeolus Pro 49V rims allow those larger tires to run at lower pressures, enhancing traction and comfort. </p><p></p><p>We had the chance to test the Aeolus Pro 49V back-to-back against the range-topping Aeolus RSL 51. On the same bike, with the same tires and tire pressure, riding the same 15-mile loop, it was honestly challenging to identify a difference in performance. If the test had been blind, we’re not sure we could have correctly which was the $1800 wheelset, or the one costing $1,000 more. Safe to say that whatever difference could be measured by CFD analysis, or by a truly rigorous road test using a power meter, the differences would be marginal. </p><p></p><p>So, where exactly do the cost savings come from? The most direct cost-saving difference is the level of carbon fiber used in the respective rims. While the Aeolus RSL range features Bontrager’s lighter top-tier “RSL OCLV”, the Aeolus Pro range uses the <em>slightly heavier</em> “OCLV Next” carbon, to match the same level of strength as the RSL. The heavier rims are part of why the Aeolus Pro 49V weighs 1555g, while the Aeolus RSL 51 wheelset is just 1410g. </p><p></p><p>Moving away from the rim, the Aeolus Pro 49V uses heavier hubs, which don’t use the same DT-Swiss internals as the Aeolus RSL 51. Still, the Bontrager Rapid Drive 108 hubs found on the Aoelus Pro 49V offer excellent engagement and a precise, snappy feel when accelerating and climbing. They also feature the same DT Swiss Aerolite Spokes, which can withstand super-high tension and have been tested to be one of the most aerodynamically efficient spokes available. </p><p></p><p>Next to the Aeolus RSL 51, the Aeolus Pro 49V has a less refined finish, but it’s certainly still a classy-looking wheelset. As someone who likes to occasionally throw fast wheels on my gravel bike for a race, the extra 2mm of internal rim width and the extra $1000 in my bank account would choosing between the two super easy. While weight is what a lot of folks fixate on when upgrading wheels, in our experience this year testing wheels and tires, we’ve downgraded its importance somewhat, assuming it’s under 1600g. Aerodynamics and low rolling resistance are where it’s at for us, and the Aeolus Pro 49V delivers both in good measure. </p><p></p><p>All Bontrager carbon wheels are warrantied for life for the original purchaser and come with the added protection of Carbon Care. If you structurally damage your wheels while riding in the first two years of ownership, Bontrager will replace them. This is a significantly more generous offer than what most carbon wheel manufacturers list as “protection”. So, if you’re looking for a versatile aero wheelset that is comfortable and reliable and has

href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fenve-ses-3.4-disc-brake-wheelset-tubeless\">ENVE SES 3.4</a> is a versatile, aero, light, and fast wheelset, according to ENVE, and we agree that it’s one of the best all-around wheelsets available. While it doesn’t stake a claim as the best wheel in any particular category, it excels across the board, making it a true all-rounder and a great pick for those of us who want one carbon wheelset that can do it all quite well. In the real world, where the dynamics of road cycling are constantly changing, the ENVE SES 3.4 adapts seamlessly to whatever’s up the road, from steep climbs to twisty, pothole-riddled descents, to windblown straightaways.</p><p></p><p>At 25mm wide internally, the SES 3.4 is wide enough to support huge gravel tires but is also aerodynamically optimized for 28c road tires designed for road racing. Speaking of tires, the ENVE SES 3.4’s hookless rim is only compatible with approved hookless tubeless-ready tires. It is possible to run the ENVE SES 3.4 with tubes, but those tubes will still need to be used in conjunction with a hookless tubeless-ready tire. In most cases, such a combination will be heavy and add significant rolling resistance, so we recommend the ENVE SES 3.4 only for riders who intend to use tubeless tires. </p><p></p><p>The SES 3.4 rims are different depths, but only marginally so, with a 39mm front and 43mm rear. The added depth bolsters responsiveness in the rear and the shallower front rim is more easily maneuvered, and also easier to hold steady in windy conditions. Responsiveness also gets a boost from the excellent ENVE Premium Road Hubs, which feature flange diameters, spacing, and spoke hole lacing that are all intended to maximize torsional stiffness, spoke tangency, and power transfer. </p><p></p><p>Until a few competitors updated their wheels recently, the SES 3.4 were the most comfortable wheels we had ever tested. While they are no longer alone at the top in terms of ride quality, they’re still at the top. The SES 3.4 has an uncanny ability to ride pitch-perfect relative to whatever tire size and pressure is installed. Whether shod in 29c ENVE SES race tires at 68PSI, or a set of knobby gravel 42s, the ride is always responsive but well-damped, inspiring you to take any type of ride you choose.</p><p></p><p>The one thing we don’t like about the ENVE 3.4 also goes for every wheel ENVE makes, and a few other brands as well, and that’s internal nipples. This design saves a couple of watts of drag and gives ENVE wheels a sleek appearance, but truing the wheels becomes considerably more difficult when it involves tearing apart a complete tubeless tire setup, including removing the tape, before even beginning to adjust the spoke nipples. It’s not a huge issue, but most of the industry sticks with external nipples, for easy spoke tension adjustments that don’t involve tire and tape removal. </p><p></p><p>That one issue aside, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fenve-ses-3.4-disc-brake-wheelset-tubeless\">ENVE SES 3.4</a> is everything we want a quiver-killer, all-around wheelset to be. As ENVE says, they are versatile, thanks to their width, aero of course (this is ENVE we’re talking about), light at 1455g, and fast, thanks to their low rolling resistance and excellent hubs. At $2850, they’re also expensive, but that’s no surprise with ENVE, a company that is still batting .1000 after a long time in the game.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a

href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fshimano-dura-ace-wh-r9270-c50-carbon-road-wheelset-tubeless\">Dura-Ace C50 Tubeless Disc</a> Wheelset, one might think that these race-bred deeps are among the most expensive carbon road wheels available. The Dura-Ace moniker, painted no less than six times on each rim, is synonymous with cost-no-object bike builds. Aside from the Dura-Ace branding, the C50 wheelset strikes a stance that looks seriously fast and thoroughly refined, as we’d expect of any wheelset at the top of the Shimano range. </p><p></p><p>And yet, the Dura Ace C50 cost $2,100 which is less than many of the other premium options on the market. It’s an interesting price point, just a few hundred dollars more than some newcomers without the race-winning pedigree, and nearly 15-20% less than other premium offerings from ENVE, Chris King, Zipp, and Roval. For racers running the requisite Shimano drivetrain, the allure of the C50 combined with its pricing makes them impossible to ignore. </p><p></p><p>The C50’s 50mm rim is an all-around aero rim that has tangible watt-saving benefits when pedaling at high speed and also gives a huge boost on descents but never feels sluggish to spin up or maneuver. Its depth is only noticeable when starting from a complete stop and during very slow-speed maneuvers. Once you’re rolling, the C50 feels eager to attack any terrain or situation. For riders wanting a shallower rim that is quicker to spin up and change direction at high speed, Shimano offers the 36mm deep <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fb%2Fshimano-dura-ace-wh-r9270-c36-carbon-road-wheelset-tubeless\">Dura Ace C36</a>. For racers, and I do mean racers, wanting the most free speed available, the Dura Ace C60 takes it even deeper, for high-speed races on flat to rolling terrain. Of course, most of us only want to have one high-end wheelset that can do it all, and of the Dura-Ace range, the C50 is that wheel. </p><p></p><p>We thoroughly enjoyed riding the Dura Ace C50, which is something that isn’t always the case with wheels this deep. While it’s nice knowing on a scientific level that wheels are fast because they are deep and aerodynamically optimized for slightly wider tires, often wheels of this depth feel cumbersome to spin up and less than eager to change direction quickly, and can be less than plush throughout long rides on rough roads. The C50s offer a damped ride quality and hum happily across broken pavement. They are nimble, allowing for easy course correction at high speed when the need arises. Climbing is surprisingly nice, with a direct, eager response to accelerations and a smooth and easy efficiency during steady seated efforts. All these things are great and should be checked off by any high-end 50mm wheel, but are all outshined by how the Dura Ace C50 responds to all-out throw-downs of power. These wheels light up and burn across the tarmac.</p><p></p><p>High praise aside, an important consideration with these or any road wheels from Shimano is that Shimano hubs are now only compatible with Shimano cassettes, and it’s not possible to run these wheels with any 12-speed drivetrain from SRAM or Campagnolo. Next, Shimano hubs use a cup-and-cone style bearing system that needs to be serviced at more frequent intervals than the much more common cartridge bearing hubs. Lastly, these are road wheels, not gravel-sometimes, do whatever wheels. They do not have the ride quality and handling characteristics that work well on super rough terrain, and what little gravel we did ride rendered them less than potent weapons.</p><p></p><p>So, for those running a Shimano drivetrain who want to race or just shred aggressively on paved roads, and who ride in dry climates or don’t shy away from a little proactive hub maintenance, the <a

I mention these other brands because some of their top-tier carbon wheels are priced such that not many of us can afford, or justify them. Dissatisfied with other options, the Ritte engineers set out to make wheels for the “meat of the bell curve”. So, Ritte created OTHR and went to work picking apart the most advanced wheels, in a quest to come up with something competitive with these top-tier offerings, at a more reasonable price, resulting in the brilliant <a href=\"https://othr.cc/products/anywhr-40-wheelset\">Anywhr 40 Wheelset</a>. </p><p></p><p>“Anywhr” is a fitting name for this wheelset, as it performs well on any surface, gradient, and wind condition. For us, the Anywhr 40 is most impressive on long rides where tapping out a steady pace over varied terrain is key, and wheels must balance aerodynamics, low inertia, and comfort. These wheels make sense for a large segment of riders, from dedicated road and crit racers, to endurance-focused g-roadie, or recreational riders who want to have fun and ride great wheels.</p><p></p><p>The Anywhr 40 were a breeze to set up tubeless, thanks to OTHR mounting and seating Vittoria Corsa Pro Control 30c tires before shipping the wheels. If you’re not a fan of doing tubeless setups at home, we recommend purchasing new tires with your Anywhr 40, to enjoy this convenience and get on the road quickly. </p><p></p><p>Climbing and descending on the Anywhr 40 was dreamy. Uphill, the wheels held speed easily, seeming to smooth out the small acceleration and deceleration of each pedal stroke. This is made possible by not only the low rim weight of 395g but also the 36-tooth ratchet system in the rear hub, which engages the cassette quickly. On descents, the 24mm wide rim maximized the tire’s grip but also held shape perfectly to quickly change direction when needed. At high speed, the 40mm depth means the front wheel was stable and predictable, allowing us to descend aggressively with total confidence. </p><p></p><p>The situation we weren’t blown away by the Anywhr 40 was in all-out sprints. These wheels feel more about consistent speed by way of low rolling resistance versus short bursts of acceleration. While some other wheels were a bit spicier than the Anywhr 40 when we had the urge to throw down our max power, those wheels’ deeper, heavier rims were also less comfortable, and not as easy to maneuver as the Anywhr 40.</p><p></p><p>After testing and loving the <a href=\"https://othr.cc/products/anywhr-40-wheelset\">OTHR Anywhr 40</a>, we’re scratching our heads and trying to understand why many of the high-end wheels we tested cost almost double. While they may not dominate the best wheels from Zipp, ENVE, and the like in any one area, they are equal to all these wheels in that  “meat of the bell curve” Ritte references, where we do 95% of our riding. For this reason, we think they are a solid value and are worth a serious look for anyone looking to upgrade this year.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://othr.cc/products/anywhr-40-wheelset\">Check Price at OTHR</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tAnother Solid Value\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fshimano-105-wh-rs710-c32-carbon-road-wheelset-tubeless\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShimano 105 C32 Tubeless Disc (WH-RS710)\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$1,050</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1504g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tubeless</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes, Hooked Tubeless Ready</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rim material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Carbon fiber</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Brake Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Disc, Centerlock</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Depth</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>32mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>21mm internal / 28mm external</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Shimano-105-C32-Tubeless-Disc.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"808\" height=\"539\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Shimano-105-C32-Tubeless-Disc.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Wheels of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Shimano-105-C32-Tubeless-Disc.jpeg 808w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Shimano-105-C32-Tubeless-Disc-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Shimano-105-C32-Tubeless-Disc-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Shimano-105-C32-Tubeless-Disc-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Shimano-105-C32-Tubeless-Disc-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Shimano-105-C32-Tubeless-Disc-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Top-notch handling</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Compliant ride quality</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Affordable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Hubs require proactive maintenance</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Compatible with Shimano cassettes only</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fshimano-105-wh-rs710-c32-carbon-road-wheelset-tubeless\">Shimano 105 C32 Tubeless Disc</a> wheelset may not be all that exciting on paper, with higher weight than some of its shallow carbon competitors, and a respectable but safe internal width of 21mm. At $1049, the price itself may even cast doubts on its ability to perform against many other wheels costing double that and beyond. </p><p></p><p>In reality, the Shimano C32 is one of those rare but glorious products that receive very little hype and attention but deliver astonishing performance and value. On the road, the C32 is impressive, climbing much better than its weight of 1504g would suggest, gliding over weathered pavement with reassuring stability, and maneuvering precisely and confidently at any speed. </p><p></p><p>Only at high speeds above 30 mph does it become obvious that the Shimano C32 are not as aero as some slightly deeper options in the 40mm range. That said, the C32 feel so stable and easy to maneuver at speed that it lends confidence which will in turn enable you to maneuver the bike more efficiently and go plenty fast. And, for those seeking a slightly more aero version, Shimano also makes the C46 with a 46mm rim depth.</p><p></p><p>Shimano lists one of the key features of the C32 as its ability to “be easily matched to any bike”. While it’s true that these wheels will work with any disc brake road frameset using 12×100 and 12×142 thru axles, and their subdued aesthetics won’t clash with any other equipment, the C32 is not currently compatible with bikes running SRAM or Campagnolo drivetrains. Without getting into the weeds, when running a 12-speed drivetrain, Shimano hubs are now only compatible with Shimano cassettes, and this is due mainly to SRAM’s adoption of a 10-tooth cog and development of their own “XDR” freehub system to match their 12-speed cassettes. If you’re running 11-speed SRAM and your cassette bottoms out with an 11-tooth cog, you do have the option to use the Shimano C32. </p><p></p><p>In addition to limited compatibility, Shimano hubs use a cup-and-cone style bearing system that needs to be serviced at more frequent intervals than the much more common cartridge bearing hubs found in other wheels. Lastly, these are road wheels, not gravel-sometimes, do whatever wheels. While their moderate width and shallow depth could work well on well-packed gravel, with tires up to about 40c, we wouldn’t want to constantly expose the hubs to dust and grime that come with gravel riding. </p><p></p><p>Those concerns aside, ride quality, precise handling, and easy acceleration are all reasons why this wheelset that costs just over $1000 is a great investment in your Shimano-equipped road bike. With the money saved by avoiding far more expensive wheels, you’ll be able to easily upgrade to a great set of tires to help the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fshimano-105-wh-rs710-c32-carbon-road-wheelset-tubeless\">Shimano C32 Tubeless Disc</a> wheels ride their best.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fshimano-105-wh-rs710-c32-carbon-road-wheelset-tubeless\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCV6YFDD/?tag=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Freynolds-ar58-carbon-wheelset-tubeless\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReynolds AR 58\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$1,450</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1700g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tubeless</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes, Hooked Tubeless Ready</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rim material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Carbon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Brake Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Rim (Disc option available)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Depth</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>58mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>19mm internal / 28mm external</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reynolds-AR-58.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1189\" height=\"793\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reynolds-AR-58.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Wheels of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reynolds-AR-58.jpeg 1189w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reynolds-AR-58-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reynolds-AR-58-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reynolds-AR-58-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reynolds-AR-58-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reynolds-AR-58-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Aero gains you can feel</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Fair price for a carbon wheelset</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Heavier than some of the competition</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Narrower internal width</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Freynolds-ar58-carbon-wheelset-tubeless\">Reynolds AR 58</a> feature the same highly aerodynamic rim that is used in the more expensive AR 58X but saves $250 and adds a few grams by using mid-range Sapim Sprint spokes, brass nipples, and economically-designed hubs. While that extra mass might be noticeable on the first few turns of the pedals, once the AR 58 are up to speed, they perform just like their more expensive counterpart, the AR 58X. </p><p></p><p>The AR 58 rim measures 58mm deep, positioning the AR 58 in the class of aero wheels that don’t just look fast, but offer a tangible feeling of free speed. The rim is optimized for 23-28c tires, although with a relatively narrow 19mm internal width, we found they handled and rolled best when shod with 25c tires. </p><p></p><p>Out of the box, our test set of AR 58 was perfectly true and round, and the spoke tension was even. Setting the AR 58 up tubeless was a breeze, as the rims come pre-taped, and required only a floor pump to seat the tires. </p><p></p><p>Braking is excellent on the rim brake version we tested, which is no surprise as Reynolds has long been a leader in carbon brake track performance. Reynolds’ proprietary Ctg2 brake track offers tremendous heat resistance, to prevent the dreaded loss of power and resin-melting that can occur quickly with carbon rims of lesser quality. Reynolds also includes a pair of Cryo blue brake pads, so you can be sure to have the best possible braking performance. </p><p></p><p>That said, these wheels aren’t for scenarios where braking is a priority. They wouldn’t be our first pick in mountainous terrain or urban settings. It’s not a knock on these wheels specifically, but if you’re considering a carbon rim brake wheelset upgrade, and like to climb and descend, or need to repeatedly accelerate and then stop, something with a shallower depth will fit the bill better. The AR 58 are about holding onto more speed with less effort. Group rides, flat-to-rolling road races, time trials, and high-speed KoM hunting are the realm of this seriously fast aero wheelset. </p><p></p><p>At 1700g, with a narrower-than-average width, the AR 58 is ideal for a powerful rider who wants to turn a big gear quickly. If keeping the weight of your bike down is a priority, Reynolds also offers the AR 41, which offers significantly less aerodynamic advantage but sheds over 250g. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Freynolds-ar58-carbon-wheelset-tubeless\">Reynolds AR 58</a> is a narrowly focused wheelset for a specific type of riding on roads that allow the speed to remain high at all times. That said, when used in its element, it’s one of the fastest and most fun-to-ride wheels we’ve ever tested, at a moderate price, comparatively speaking.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Freynolds-ar58-carbon-wheelset-tubeless\">Check Price at Backcountry</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://hedcycling.com/products/vanquish-rc-performance-series?variant=45049338396962\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHED Vanquish RC4 Performance Series\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$1,750</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>1542g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Tubeless</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes, Hooked Tubeless Ready</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rim material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Carbon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Brake Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Disc</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Depth</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>40mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>21mm internal / 30mm external</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HED-Vanquish-RC4-Performance-Series.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HED-Vanquish-RC4-Performance-Series.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Wheels of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HED-Vanquish-RC4-Performance-Series.jpeg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HED-Vanquish-RC4-Performance-Series-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HED-Vanquish-RC4-Performance-Series-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HED-Vanquish-RC4-Performance-Series-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HED-Vanquish-RC4-Performance-Series-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HED-Vanquish-RC4-Performance-Series-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Stiff</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lighting quick acceleration</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Comfortable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>A bit heavier than other 40mm deep options</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://hedcycling.com/products/vanquish-rc-performance-series?variant=45049338396962\">HED Vanquish RC4 Performance</a> wheelset is a responsive and predictable wheel that feels ready to race anything from a gran fondo in the high mountains to an urban criterium. At 40mm deep, the rims offer a moderate aero advantage, but compared to most wheels with deep carbon rims, the Vanquish RC4 feels more eager to accelerate. This is most noticeable on steep pitches of climbs, or when pounding the pedals to gain speed out of corners. </p><p></p><p>The Vanquish RC Performance lineup of wheels features the same rim profile as the more expensive and lighter Vanquish RC Pro lineup but uses a less expensive carbon fiber and slightly different hub internals to keep the price more approachable at $1,750 US. After spending time on a variety of HED wheels over the years from both the Performance and Pro levels, we feel that HED does an excellent job of preserving all the critical aspects of the Pro Series when tweaking the finer points to create the Performance line. Ride quality, handling, and reliability are all top-notch, just in a <em>slightly heavier</em> overall package. And, although the 1542g weight might make the bike feel a tad heavier to hold than some other mid-depth carbon wheels, the Vanquish “ride light”, meaning they feel quick to accelerate and hold speed well when working against gravity. </p><p></p><p>Ride quality is direct but refined. With a 21mm internal width, the hooked, tubeless-ready Vanquish rim is optimized for tires from 25 to 30c and is compatible with both tubeless and clincher road tires. We found that the RC4 rode best with 28c tubeless tires at around 75 PSI (160lb rider), balancing low rolling resistance with razor-sharp handling. To be clear, these are road wheels, and while certainly compatible with larger gravel tires, are not as compliant as HED’s “Emporia” line of gravel wheels. We appreciate this, as we found that some wheels we’ve tried that are designed to ride well on both road and gravel lack the on-road responsiveness of the HED Vanquish. </p><p></p><p>HED’s in-house designed GP Performance hubs feature stiff axles and a 5-pawl freehub for quick acceleration. Sealed cartridge bearings are easily replaced when the time comes. Sapim CX-Ray spokes complete the build and offer excellent ride quality and responsiveness. The HED Vanquish RC4 Performance wheelset is built by hand at HED’s facility in Roseville, Minnesota.

Previously, CFD modeling was limited to two-dimensional simulations of air turbulence, but now, according to Bontrager, engineers “run the whole design process in three dimensions. Now we can account for every gram of drag in every direction through every plane across all aspects of the wheel.” </p><p></p><p>The benefit is a rim that is not only better in calm conditions but also more stable in the wind and offers lower tire rolling resistance. Reduced rolling resistance is now the primary driver of increased speed, and while a lot of the gains are from tire compounds, rims like the Aeolus RSL 51 TLR Disc have grown wider – 23mm internally in this case –  to spread and support the tire so it can work as efficiently as possible. How efficiently you might ask? Well, according to Bontrager, when tested with a 25c Bontrager tubeless clincher the Aeolus RSL 51 TLR Disc saved 6.3 watts at 28mph, over the outgoing Aelous XXX 47mm with a sew-up tubular. </p><p></p><p>Moving away from the exceptionally fast rims, Bontrager continued to choose the best for the Aeolus RSL 51 TLR Disc, building them with DT Swiss 240 hubs. The DT 240 is a step up from the venerable DT 350, providing a reduction in weight and offering good engagement in the rear by way of a 36-tooth star ratchet EXP freehub system. </p><p></p><p>The Aeolus RSL 51 TLR Disc wheels feel incredibly fast on the road. The gains in aerodynamic and rolling efficiency are especially evident on downhills where even a moderately fit rider can easily hit or exceed the types of speeds for which these wheels are optimized. Even steep climbs were a welcome sight, as the responsiveness of the entire wheel system, and especially the rapidly engaging rear hub, seemed to flatten and shorten every steep pitch. </p><p></p><p>At $2700, you’d expect nothing less, but it’s fair to say that it’s easy to spend as much or more and not get as much speed as the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=15585&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fequipment%2Fcycling-components%2Fbike-wheels%2Froad-bike-wheels%2Fbontrager-aeolus-rsl-51-tlr-disc-road-wheel%2Fp%2F34500%2F%3FcolorCode%3Dblack\">Aeolus RSL 51 TLR Disc</a> delivers.

Since the rim is micro-hooked, The 45 is compatible with any clincher or tubeless-ready tire on the market. The micro-hook offers the tire security of a traditional hooked rim but also smooths out the rim-tire interface for better aerodynamics and impact protection. Tubeless tape and valves are included with each set of The 45 Clincher Wheels.</p><p></p><p>Setting up The 45 tubeless was easy, with a single layer of HiFi’s own tubeless tape, and a standard floor pump. The 45 were shod in Vittoria Corsa Pro Control 28c tires, which measured 29.3mm when inflated to 75 PSI. </p><p></p><p>On the road, The 45 Carbon Clinchers inspire the confidence to get up to speed and stay there, whether on windy flat sections, climbs, or descents. The Sapim bladed spokes and Japanese-manufactured stainless bearings inside the HiFi R36 hubs ensure that the entire wheel system runs comfortably and smoothly. Freehub engagement is rapid, thanks to a 4-pawl system engaging a 36-tooth ring in the rear, making those steep pitches and sudden surges of speed things to relish. </p><p></p><p>At $2090, HiFi’s The 45 Clincher sits at a competitive price point alongside Shimano’s Dura-Ace C50 ($2099) and a few hundred dollars more than other high-achieving wheels in this test, like the HED Vanquish RC4 ($1750). Since you can’t really go wrong, the decision between these three wheels should be made based on the marginal differences. For instance, while the Dura-Ace C50 might have a bit more bling and carry a smidge more speed on the fastest routes, the cup-and-cone bearings in the hubs require more proactive maintenance and are only compatible with Shimano freehubs. While the HED Vanquish RC4 is less expensive and feels a bit more pugnacious on grippy climbs, the HiFi are more compliant and potentially a bit more aero thanks to 5mm of additional depth. </p><p></p><p>In other words, <a href=\"https://ridehifi.com/shop/45-disc-carbon-clinchers/\">HiFi’s The 45 Disc Carbon</a> are a balanced, versatile, all-around great set of wheels that competes with some of the best around. They also happen to look great, in our opinion, and pair particularly well with HiFi’s black/gold <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-handlebar-tape/\">handlebar

Classic Zeta Disc</a> wheelset stands out from the stealthy masses of disc brake wheels, built with high-polish components that are also high-performance and high-value. For 2024, Ritchey engineers have upgraded the Classic Zeta disc with a 4-pawl freehub for faster drivetrain engagement, and DT Swiss Competition spokes for reliable performance mile after mile. </p><p></p><p>The Classic Zeta Disc features a shallow aluminum rim that is compliant, easy to maneuver, and quick to spin up. The rim width is a conservative but reasonable 19.5mm internally, and 24.4mm externally, which means that the Classic Zeta Disc will work best with tires ranging from 25-28c. The Classic Zeta disc will safely accept tires larger than that but will create a bit of the lightbulb profile that wider rims prevent. If running wider tires in the 30-35c range is important, the Ritchey WCS Zeta Disc wheels are worth a look. </p><p></p><p>For recreational road riding, the Classic Zeta Disc is a blissful mixture of smooth and compliant ride quality, easy acceleration, and stable handling. Compared to an OE (Original Equipment) wheelset, The Classic Zeta Disc is an impactful upgrade and well worth the cost of $449 US. </p><p></p><p>The disc brake interface is 6-bolt, which is a less common spec of disc rotor, and something to be aware of when setting up the Classic Zeta Disc. It’s fairly unlikely that the rotors that are coming off of OE wheels are compatible, so factor in the expense of a pair of 6-bolt rotors into the setup cost of the Classic Zeta Disc. </p><p></p><p>Aside from that small compatibility issue, the Classic Zeta Disc is an easy wheelset to own and ride. If you plan to use them on paved roads only, we recommend setting the Classic Zeta with innertubes, to avoid the additional expense of tubeless tape and valves, neither of which are included. In our opinion, the benefits of tubeless road tires are marginal at best with tires under 30c, which is simply a bigger tire than what is optimal for the Classic Zeta Disc rim. </p><p></p><p>The hubs use sealed cartridge bearings which run smooth and are easily replaced when the time comes. Brass spoke nipples won’t corrode and lend a stout reliability to the build of the Classic Zeta Disc.</p><p></p><p>At 1750g, one could label the Classic Zeta Disc as a heavy road wheelset, but we take a more nuanced view, which is that it’s important to avoid compounding the weight of these wheels by pairing them with heavy tires. This is another reason to go with a lightweight 25-28c clincher and lightweight innertube, versus a likely heavier road tubeless tire setup. </p><p></p><p>The Classic Zeta also makes a great workhorse training or winter wheelset for a classy metal bike, so you can preserve your carbon deeps for summertime when fitness and riding conditions are at their peak.

Should Trust Us</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Bikerumor, we love riding our bikes and we’re always seeking out the latest and greatest products to help improve our performance and enhance our experience out on the road. And, we know that a quality set of road bike wheels is one of the best performance upgrades you can make. Fortunately, we’re always testing out fresh new wheels, and we get to try just about everything on the market. This gives us the opportunity to pass along our experience and help you navigate the myriad options that are out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this buyer’s guide, author Bennett Shane did a large group test including the majority of the models included, supplemented by a few models that our editorial team has tested and loved. Bennett is an avid road cyclist who has been riding seriously for over two decades. Though his racing days are largely behind him, he still rides obsessively for fun, fitness, and to test out a huge range of cycling products for reviews. Bennett spent many years working at various prominent brands in the cycling industry and is about as knowledgeable as one can be about cycling products and technologies from apparel to components. His road cycling and industry experience combine to give him a keen ability to analyze the gear he tests, and we’ve called on that skill a lot lately for a huge range of road cycling-specific buyer’s guides. In addition to road bike wheels, Bennett has tested apparel like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-shorts/\">cycling bib shorts</a> and jackets, components like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-pedals/\">road bike pedals</a>, and accessories including <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-shoes/\">road bike shoes</a> and helmets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To test wheels, we received each model and set up each wheelset tubeless. For the vast majority of the wheels included here, we used the Vittoria Pro Control TLR in 28mm as a control tire, although a few models were tested with other <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-best-road-bike-tires/\">road bike tires</a> for various reasons. We used Silca’s Tire Pressure Calculator to ensure that tire pressure was optimal and in most cases rode the wheels over the same test route to compare them in the same scenarios and surface conditions. The primary test route features flat, rolling, and hilly terrain with climbs topping out at around the 25-minute mark for a well-trained rider. We also intentionally rode deeper wheels whenever windy conditions arrived, to test their stability. We did not use a wind tunnel to verify any aerodynamic claims made by manufacturers, instead, we chose to focus on the tangible things that most riders care about, such as ride quality, handling, acceleration, durability, and serviceability, including warranty and crash replacement provisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-bennett-testing.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-bennett-testing.jpeg\" alt=\"Bennett Shane testing the Shimano Dura-Ace road bike wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-bennett-testing.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-bennett-testing-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-bennett-testing-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-bennett-testing-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-bennett-testing-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-bennett-testing-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-bennett-testing-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-bennett-testing-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Bennett Shane spent months testing the majority of the road bike wheels included in this buyer’s guide, pictured here riding the Shimano Dura-Ace.

Some considerations are pretty straightforward, like choosing wheels for disc or rim brakes, but there are many other factors to weigh when making a purchase decision. Below, we provide a little explanation about choices in rim material, rim width, rim depth, tire compatibility, freehub bodies, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rim Material</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The material used in the construction of the rims is one of the biggest factors separating aftermarket road bike wheels. Most road bike rims are made from either aluminum or carbon fiber and there are great wheels being produced in either material. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Carbon Fiber</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Carbon-fiber-road-wheels-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Carbon-fiber-road-wheels-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Chris King ARD44 road wheels are made from carbon fiber and a thermoplastic resin to form waht is called Fusion Fiber\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Carbon-fiber-road-wheels-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Carbon-fiber-road-wheels-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Carbon-fiber-road-wheels-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Carbon-fiber-road-wheels-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Carbon-fiber-road-wheels-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Carbon-fiber-road-wheels-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Carbon-fiber-road-wheels-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Carbon-fiber-road-wheels-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Carbon Fiber typically costs more but is a great material for road bike wheels due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, the ability to mold it into unique shapes, and manipulate its performance characteristics.

In reality, carbon fiber rims are often no lighter than aluminum rims, and depending on the depth of the rim, can often result in a hefty wheel that won’t be particularly fun for climbing. Of course, aerodynamics are a bigger concern than weight for many riders, and here carbon fiber has an undeniable advantage over aluminum, in that it can molded into an array of shapes to cheat the wind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While rim material has only a fraction of the effect on ride quality as tires do, carbon rims do typically give any bike a more damped, efficient ride quality, most noticeable on rougher surfaces. Carbon fiber, and more specifically the interfaces in the composite structure, have a greater ability to absorb high-frequency vibration than aluminum. This feeling has been enhanced by the advent of disc brakes, as engineers are now free to design the rim/tire interface with no braking in mind. With the brake track out of the picture, the trend has been to use less carbon at the outermost edge of the rim, and to size and shape the carbon such that it promotes better shock absorption and lower rolling resistance through the tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary downside to carbon fiber is that it is expensive, with carbon wheels often costing double that of their aluminum counterparts. And, until very recently, carbon fiber rims haven’t been the most environmentally friendly given the difficulty of recycling the material. A small handful of brands are now making carbon fiber rims with thermoplastic resin that makes them more easily recyclable including the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=28905&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fchrisking.com%2Fproducts%2Fchris-king-ard44-r45d-24-24\">Chris King ARD44</a> wheels which are made with thermoplastic <em>Fusion Fiber</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aluminum</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX.jpeg\" alt=\"Testing the Roval Aplinist SLX aluminum road bike wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Aluminum rims, like those used on the Roval Alpinist SLX wheels seen here, still perform quite well and cost significantly less than carbon options. (photo/Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Aluminum has been used for many years in the production of road bike wheels and is generally much more affordable than carbon fiber. Not only is the raw material less expensive, but the production costs are also typically much lower. As a result, most aluminum road bike wheels are less expensive, though there are still plenty of premium aluminum options. Due to the lower cost, many low to mid-range complete bike builds will usually come with aluminum wheels/rims. This is not to say that wheels made with aluminum rims won’t be a performance upgrade over a set of cheaper stock wheels, far from it. In fact, there are aluminum wheels that rival their carbon counterparts in terms of both weight and ride quality, while beating them handily when it comes to price. A prime example is the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66154X1653891&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.specialized.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Falpinist-slx-disc%2Fp%2F218349%3Fcolor%3D353087-218349\">Roval Alpinist SLX</a>, which at $800 are much more affordable than premium carbon options without giving up much in terms of performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rim Width</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-rim-width.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-rim-width.jpeg\" alt=\"The Reserve 40|44 road wheels are 25.5mm (front) and 25mm (rear) wide internal.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-rim-width.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-rim-width-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-rim-width-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-rim-width-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-rim-width-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-rim-width-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-rim-width-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Reserve-rim-width-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Modern road wheels are trending a bit wider along with a general trend of wider tires. The Reserve 40|44 have 25.5mm (front) and 25mm (rear) internal widths. (photo/Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Road rims have grown in width recently to improve their compatibility with the corresponding growth in the width of road bike tires. Some brands and models are now at 25mm in internal width, a 20% increase in some cases from just a few years ago. The width refers to the internal distance between the bead hooks on the inside of the rim, not the external width including the bead walls. Increasing internal width improves the relationship between the rim and tire, particularly when using wider tires. Wider modern road tires in the 28-32c range will take on a more domed shape with slightly larger air volume when mounted to a wider rim, thus improving the aerodynamics of the rim/tire system as a whole, while reducing rolling resistance, improving handling, and boosting comfort through a larger volume of air. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our opinion, rims narrower than 21mm (internal) are almost outdated at this point. Rims in the 21-23mm wide range are adequately wide for any true road tire. Rims with 25mm internal width are designed and intended to be able to accommodate road and gravel tires that are upwards of 40mm in width, so while not any disadvantage, per se, this rim width means those rims will typically only work for tires 28c and wider. That said, those who like to explore smooth gravel or poorly maintained paved mountain roads may enjoy the benefits of a wider rim paired with a plumper all-road tire. It is worth mentioning that since older frames, whether made for rim or disc brakes, may be designed to only clear a maximum of 25mm, you’ll want to check out the areas of your frame and fork where clearance is tight, to ensure that newer, wider rims will be compatible and safe to ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rim Depth</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bontrager-rim-depth.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bontrager-rim-depth.jpeg\" alt=\"A close look at the Bontrager Aeolus RSL 51 road wheels and their 51mm rim depth\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bontrager-rim-depth.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bontrager-rim-depth-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bontrager-rim-depth-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bontrager-rim-depth-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bontrager-rim-depth-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bontrager-rim-depth-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bontrager-rim-depth-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The depth of rims varies widely depending on their intended purpose. The Bontrager Aeolus RSL 51 is a good example of an aerodynamic deep-section rim intended to provide aerodynamic benefits. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With many aftermarket road bike wheels being made for purposes like aerodynamics or climbing/lightweight, the rims themselves are being designed differently for their specific use cases. One of the most obvious and visible differentiators is the depth of the rims which range from deep to shallow, and everything in between. In general, the deeper a rim gets, the more aerodynamic it becomes, so aero wheels typically have a taller rim profile, usually 40-50mm and above. While deep section rims can provide aerodynamic benefits, the extra material needed to construct them can add weight and the additional structure can present as stiffer and less forgiving than lower-profile options. Aero rims are also more susceptible to the effects of cross winds which can impact your bike’s stability and handling in gusty conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shallow section rims typically don’t provide the same aerodynamic benefits as deeper aero rims, but they are generally lighter-weight and the lower profile of the rim allows them to be a bit more compliant. While that is a very broad generalization, most super light climbing wheels also happen to be relatively low-profile. Many modern all-around wheels have a mid-section depth, 30-40mm or so, which aims to balance the attributes of low weight, ride quality, <em>and</em> aerodynamic benefits. These are often the best choice for riders who want a wheelset that performs day in and day out on any type of ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tire Compatibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cadex-36-hookless-tubeless.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cadex-36-hookless-tubeless.jpeg\" alt=\"A look at the Cadex 36 Disc wheels and which are hookless tubeless\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cadex-36-hookless-tubeless.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cadex-36-hookless-tubeless-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cadex-36-hookless-tubeless-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cadex-36-hookless-tubeless-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cadex-36-hookless-tubeless-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cadex-36-hookless-tubeless-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cadex-36-hookless-tubeless-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cadex-36-hookless-tubeless-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>It’s important to make sure the tires you choose are compatible with the rims. In the case of the hookless Cadex 36, this means only using them with approved hookless tubeless tires. (photo/Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtually all road bike wheels being produced these days are compatible with some tubeless road tires. However, you need to be sure that you use tires that are compatible with your specific rims. Each type of rim has advantages and drawbacks. This is particularly true of hookless tubeless rims which are not compatible with all tubeless tires and are wholly incompatible with clincher tires. Hookless tubeless rims have comparatively limited tire options and should only be used with ETRTO-approved hookless tubeless tires, but provide the best impact protection for the rim, and complement larger, 28-32c tires best. While many of the best road bike wheel manufacturers in the business are making hookless road rims and wheels, there is plenty of lively debate about hookless rims and tires for road riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hunt-aerodynamicist-44-wheels-review-rim-hub-details-05-jpg.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1383\" height=\"922\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hunt-aerodynamicist-44-wheels-review-rim-hub-details-05-jpg.jpeg\" alt=\"A closer look at the hooked rim of the Hunt Aerodynamicist road wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hunt-aerodynamicist-44-wheels-review-rim-hub-details-05-jpg.jpeg 1383w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hunt-aerodynamicist-44-wheels-review-rim-hub-details-05-jpg-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hunt-aerodynamicist-44-wheels-review-rim-hub-details-05-jpg-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hunt-aerodynamicist-44-wheels-review-rim-hub-details-05-jpg-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hunt-aerodynamicist-44-wheels-review-rim-hub-details-05-jpg-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hunt-aerodynamicist-44-wheels-review-rim-hub-details-05-jpg-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>A look at the hooked bead wall of the Hunt Aerodynamicist road wheels.

Hooked tubeless rims offer compatibility with any tire, but are <em>slightly</em> more vulnerable to impact and may incur a <em>very slight</em> aero penalty at the rim-tire interface in some cases. Clincher rims may still be available but have dwindled with the industry-wide transition to tubeless. Clincher tires are compatible with tubeless-ready hooked and micro-hooked rims but require a tube. Clincher rims and tires are easy to set up and maintain if you’re okay with foregoing tubeless technology. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>-Hookless tubeless rim compatibility: APPROVED hookless tubeless tires (with or without inner tube)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>-Hooked tubeless-ready clincher rim compatibility: ALL tubeless and clincher tires (with or without tube)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>-Clincher rim compatibility: ALL tubeless and clincher tires (WITH innertube)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Brakes and Axles</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disc-brake-road-wheels.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disc-brake-road-wheels.jpeg\" alt=\"Dis brakes and thru-axle compatibility for the Reserve 40|44 road bike wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disc-brake-road-wheels.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disc-brake-road-wheels-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disc-brake-road-wheels-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disc-brake-road-wheels-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disc-brake-road-wheels-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disc-brake-road-wheels-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disc-brake-road-wheels-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Most modern bikes use thru-axles front and rear and are designed to work with disc brakes.

And after years of mixing road and MTB technology together to form a maelstrom of “standards”, things have settled down and are more straightforward in terms of wheel-to-frame and hub-to-brake compatibility. The standards are below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>-Axles: 100mm x 12mm front; 142mm x 12mm rear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>-Brake rotor interface: Center lock is the most common by far, although there are some 6-bolt hubs available as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still plenty of folks who prefer rim brakes and there are quite a few rim brake frames in use (and some still being produced), so they are still relevant but less common.

Therefore, you’ll need to confirm that any wheel you purchase to upgrade this bike can be converted to quick-release axles with different end caps. This is done by changing the end caps and is an easy job, assuming that quick-release end caps are included or available for the wheels you are choosing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Freehubs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-freehubs.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-freehubs.jpeg\" alt=\"A closer look at the rear hub and freehub body in the Chris King ARD44 road bike wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-freehubs.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-freehubs-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-freehubs-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-freehubs-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-freehubs-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-freehubs-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-freehubs-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The freehub body you need will be dictated by the cassette you need to install for your drivetrain. Many brands, like Chris King, offer their wheels with the freehub body of your choice. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When selecting wheels online, the vendor will typically present a menu of freehub options that correspond to the type of cassette that will be mounted on the hub rear wheel. Options will include Shimano HG, SRAM XDR, Campagnolo, and possibly Shimano Mircospline. If the option you need isn’t available at the time of purchase, it likely can be ordered directly from the manufacturer separately, at an additional cost. Most wheel and hub manufacturers make a full assortment of freehub bodies, with some notable exceptions, the most glaring of which is Shimano, which only offers freehubs that are optimized for its own Hyperglide and Microspline cassette interfaces. While other 11-speed cassettes, and 12-speed cassettes from alternative brands, like Rotor and KMC, are compatible with Shimano wheels, SRAM and Campagnolo 12-speed cassettes are not. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Freehub Engagement</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Freehub engagement is an often overlooked aspect of road wheel performance and is a big deal for riders who like to ride in hilly terrain or race. Without getting too technical, higher engagement hubs decrease the number of degrees between engagement points and therefore the delay from when your power hits the pedal to when the cassette engages, and that power is translated into forward progress. While freehub engagement speed is arguably less important in road cycling where riders typically spin the pedals at a smoother, more even cadence than mountain bikers or gravel riders, quick engagement is appreciated by many on the road as well. Hubs using at least 5 “pawls” or a “ratchet” system will provide this rapid engagement, and you’ll feel it working when hopping out of the saddle on a steep climb or accelerating hard out of a corner. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-climbing.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-climbing.jpeg\" alt=\"Climbing on the Chris King ARD44 wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-climbing.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-climbing-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-climbing-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-climbing-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-climbing-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-climbing-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-climbing-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-climbing-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Quick freehub engagement can be a benefit when you’re climbing and your cadence gets choppy, or for anyone who likes a precise feel with minimal lag when they start pedaling again.

Ceramic bearings are a popular upgrade option in ultra-premium wheels. Harder than steel, with a smoother surface and more uniform dimensions, ceramic bearings distribute the load equally across every ball while also reducing friction. The result is less power required from the rider to spin the bearing. Without exposure to extreme contamination from road spray or pressure washing, ceramic bearings may outlast steel bearings in most situations. Good thing, too, as they cost as much as some nice wheelsets to replace if they ever do wear out. The bottom line is that cycling never gets easier, you just go faster, so if you’re looking for wheels to change the way your bike rides, ceramic bearings are not necessary. If you’re looking for every possible efficiency gain for your next race, or to own every piece of bling kit under the sun, then go ceramic. If you’re ceramic-curious but it’s not an option at the time of purchase, you can typically upgrade down the line. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spokes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bladed-spokes.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bladed-spokes.jpeg\" alt=\"A close look at the rear hub on a HiFi wheel and the bladed spokes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bladed-spokes.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bladed-spokes-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bladed-spokes-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bladed-spokes-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bladed-spokes-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bladed-spokes-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bladed-spokes-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Bladed spokes, like these on one of the HiFi wheels, are super common on road bike wheels. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spoke count refers to the number of spokes connecting the hub to the rim. Generally speaking, the more spokes used to build a wheel, the stiffer, more durable, and heavier that wheel is. Spoke quality, nipple material, build quality, rim design, rider weight, and especially use case all factor into determining the correct spoke count for your next wheelset. But spoke count alone should not be used as a threshold for a wheel to be considered durable, stiff, or safe. High-quality spokes, laced to well-designed rims by hand will often facilitate a lower spoke count with no compromises on stiffness and durability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internal nipples on tubeless rims can be problematic from a maintenance standpoint. While this design may offer a small aerodynamic advantage and offer svelte aesthetics, it also requires removal and reinstallation of the tubeless tire system to make adjustments to spoke tension. It’s an added cost or time requirement that is something to be aware of. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbon spokes are becoming more prevalent, and while they tangibly improve responsiveness, the potential downtime to source replacements makes this a choice worthy of shrewd judgment. If you’re on the lighter side, tend to ride smooth roads that are close to home, and have the budget to preemptively order some compatible spares, carbon spokes are a nice upgrade. All mid-range and high-end spokes are bladed or butted to varying degrees. These features help increase strength, improve ride quality, save weight, and enhance aerodynamics. Straight pull spokes also bolster responsiveness and overall wheel strength. Top spokes include Sapim CX-Ray and Sprint, DT Swiss Aerolite, and Aerocomp, but numerous options compete with these. If a wheelset doesn’t disclose the type of spoke used in the build, or only the brand, it’s worth digging to find out, as this part of the wheel is sadly often used as a cost-control measure, and yet is critical to how a wheel feels, performs, and holds together long-term. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-value-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-value-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding the Cadex 36 Disc road bike wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-value-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-value-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-value-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-value-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-value-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-value-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-value-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Road-wheels-value-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Road bike wheels vary pretty wildy in price. Some premium options, like the Cadex 36 Disc will set you back a cool $3,200 retail. (photo/Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Value</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While a nice set of aftermarket wheels can absolutely be a major performance upgrade, many premium options cost more than some complete bikes. Fancier materials, high-end hubs, ceramic bearings, carbon fiber production costs, and lots of engineering may factor into the price of many wheels to make the price higher. Of course, if cost isn’t a concern, then some of the super-premium wheels like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=28905&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fchrisking.com%2Fproducts%2Fchris-king-ard44-r45d-24-24\">Chris King ARD44</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.cadex-cycling.com/us/cadex-36-disc-tubeless\">Cadex 36 Disc</a> may be just the ticket to transform the way your bike rides. Still, many of the performance gains may only truly matter to high-performance cyclists and racers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, like most people, you aren’t swimming in cash, then there are some better values to be found in more moderately priced wheels with performance differences that will likely be negligible. Of course, when we say “moderately priced” we are talking about wheels in the $1,500 to $1,800 range, like the <a href=\"https://mikes-bikes.sjv.io/c/2227671/987441/12988?subId1=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fmikesbikes.com%2Fproducts%2Freserve-40-44-road-wheelset\">Reserve 40|44 DT 350</a>, or the <a href=\"https://othr.cc/products/anywhr-40-wheelset\">OTHR Anywhr 40</a>, which still probably sounds expensive to lots of people. But, when compared to wheels that cost $2,500 or more, they are certainly more affordable, comparatively speaking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since even mid-range road bike wheels will still be out of many people’s budget, it’s good to know that there are quite a few aftermarket options that will blow the performance of most stock wheels out of the water. A couple of good examples are the $800 <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66154X1653891&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.specialized.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Falpinist-slx-disc%2Fp%2F218349%3Fcolor%3D353087-218349\">Roval Alpinist SLX</a> or the $550 <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66154X1653891&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradeinn.com%2Fbikeinn%2Fen%2Fvision-trimax-35-cl-disc-road-wheel-set%2F139090816%2Fp%3FqueryID%3D1096f1bf01db7b32d6dac3e2d65ae6e5%26buscador_search\">Vision Trimax 35 DB CL</a> wheels. These wheels may be made with aluminum rims, but they perform well while costing a fraction of the price of many of the high-end competitors. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Climbing on the Roval Alpinist SLX road bike wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-1-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roval-Alpinist-SLX-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Even a less expensive set of aftermarket wheels like the Roval Alpinist SLX will be a significant performance upgrade over the stock wheels on many bikes.

The stock wheels that come on many complete bikes, particularly low-mid priced builds, are often chosen not for their performance, but as a way for brands to save money. By investing in a quality set of aftermarket wheels, you can choose a model that offers specific performance benefits to suit your needs and preferences. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deep-section aero wheels can provide improved aerodynamics to help powerful riders or racers move faster. Feathery climbing wheels can help riders get up hills faster. Mid-depth all-around wheels can do everything pretty darn well and many wheels can enhance the ride quality of your bike through vibration-damping, resulting in a smoother, faster ride with greater control, comfort, and less fatigue. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Is it worth spending more on carbon?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>When considering a road bike wheel upgrade, that usually means spending money with the goal of improving your bike’s performance and enhancing its ride quality. More often than not, this means shelling out big bucks for a wheelset with carbon fiber rims. While there are plenty of excellent aluminum wheelsets on the market, carbon fiber does have some advantages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbon rims are generally lighter than comparable aluminum rims. Carbon fiber absorbs vibration more readily than aluminum for a smoother, more comfortable ride. Carbon can also be manipulated in ways to produce specific shapes and performance characteristics. Carbon is also very strong, and many rims come with exceptional warranties (lifetime in some cases) that can help justify the higher price. And, while carbon wheels have traditionally been very pricey, some brands and models are now only just a little more expensive (or less) than nice aluminum models. Hunt is a good example, as their <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=26829&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingroadbikewheels&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.huntbikewheels.com%2Fproducts%2Fhunt-44-aerodynamicist-carbon-disc-wheelset\">Aerodynamicist wheelset costs $1,279</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Do aero wheels really make a difference?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>There’s a reason that time trialists wear silly helmets and ride deep-section wheels when they’re racing. Aerodynamics matter. The benefits of aero road wheels may not be worth the cost for purely recreational riders, but racers who are seeking to squeeze out every marginal gain possible can often find some extra speed and time on the clock by riding them. While the deeper rims add some weight, that is typically offset by the rim’s ability to cut more smoothly through the air. These benefits are most tangible in race situations, flat and rolling terrain, and over time. There are numerous studies and testing results that can be found online that back this up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, deep-section aero rims are often less ideal for climbing due to the added weight, and they can sometimes be less stable in cross-winds compared to shallower rim profiles. For this reason, many manufacturers are producing mid-depth rims in the 40mm range that provide a slight aero advantage while keeping weight lower and reducing cross-wind instability. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>There are so many options, how do I know which wheels to choose?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>The best road bike wheels are the ones that are geared towards the type of riding you do <em>most of the time</em>. Do you spend significant amounts of time climbing big hills? Then a light, feathery, responsive wheelset can help reduce the overall weight of your bike and rotational mass, and make climbing more enjoyable. Do you ride mostly on flat or gently rolling terrain? Then perhaps a deep-section wheel is a good choice to help maximize your aerodynamic gains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you ride all types of terrain? The happy middle ground between the lightweight climbing wheels and the aero wheels is probably the best bet for finding a well-rounded wheelset that does everything pretty darn well. Do you ride rough pavement, sometimes find yourself on well-maintained gravel roads, or switch it up between gravel and road riding? Some of the new, wider (25mm internal) wheels on the market might be the best fit. These wheels work well with bigger all-road and gravel tires which can enhance comfort and control on mixed surfaces. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What is hookless tubeless and do I need it?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Hookless rims gained popularity in the mountain and gravel worlds but have recently caught on in road cycling as well. Traditionally, road rims had small hooks on the bead wall (and many still do) that are intended to interface with the bead of the tire for a secure connection between the two. More recently, many road rim and wheel manufacturers have done away with the bead hooks, hence the term hookless, as it makes the rims slightly easier to produce, is claimed to make them more resistant to damage from impact, and the lack of the bead hook provides a smoother transition between the tire and rim and can improve aerodynamics slightly. Without the bead hook, however, hookless rims are only intended for use with ETRTO-approved hookless compatible tires that have been produced to meet higher tolerances on hookless rims. Hookless tubeless rims generally have lower maximum pressures and there is guidance on tire compatibility from ETRTO and from the brands themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does anyone <em>need</em> to ride hookless tubeless road wheels? Not necessarily, but many of the best road bike wheels on the market use hookless rims. That said, this technology is hotly debated and many riders believe it is unnecessary and unsafe. Regardless of public opinion, hookless tubeless wheel and tire combinations are ridden safely by many thousands of cyclists, and it is here to stay. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n<div>\n\t<h2>Related Content</h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article>\n\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-best-road-bike-tires/\">\n\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1372\" height=\"915\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tires-collage.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Tires of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tires-collage.jpeg 1372w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tires-collage-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tires-collage-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tires-collage-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tires-collage-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-tires-collage-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/buyers-guides/\">Buyers Guides</a></div>\n\n<h2>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-best-road-bike-tires/\">\n\t\tThe Best Road Bike Tires of 2024\t</a>\n</h2>\n\n<div>\n\t<p>As the only point of contact between your bike and the road, road bike tires are a critical component for performance, comfort, and safety while…</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</article>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article>\n\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-shoes/\">\n\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Shoes of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/buyers-guides/\">Buyers Guides</a></div>\n\n<h2>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-shoes/\">\n\t\tThe Best Road Bike Shoes of 2024\t</a>\n</h2>\n\n<div>\n\t<p>When cycling, your shoes are an important accessory that enhance comfort, control, and efficiency, and finding the best road bike shoes can help elevate your…</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</article>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-wheels/\">The Best Road Bike Wheels of 2024</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"befe445f796d563fc685ba9e390624c70e6f66675053020d72ed7d815d547c63","category":"Cycling"}
