{"title":"Apple Announces Self Service Repair Program, Starting With iPhone 12 and 13","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/17/apple-launches-self-service-repair/","date":1637158075000,"content":"Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/\">today announced</a> the \"Self Service Repair\" program, allowing users to complete their own repairs via a new online store dedicated to parts and tools.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/apple-self-service-repair-announcement.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Self Service Repair program will give customers who are comfortable with the idea of completing their own repairs access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and manuals, starting with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> lineups. The scheme will be introduced in phases, adding more repairs and supported devices over time. Apple chief operating officer Jeff Williams said:<blockquote>Creating greater access to Apple genuine parts gives our customers even more choice if a repair is needed. In the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and training, and now we're providing an option for those who wish to complete their own repairs.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe first phase of the program will focus on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s most commonly serviced parts, such as the display, battery, and camera, but more kinds of repairs will become available later next year. Apple silicon Macs with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, 13-inch MacBook Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, and 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, will be next to join the scheme.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Self Service Repair program will be facilitated by a new Apple Self Service Repair Online Store, offering more than 200 individual parts and tools to complete ‌iPhone 12‌ and ‌iPhone 13‌ repairs at launch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCustomers who want to perform a repair will first be encouraged to consult the Repair Manual before placing an order for parts and tools using the Apple Self Service Repair Online Store. After the repair has been completed, customers who return their used or broken part to Apple for recycling will receive credit toward their purchase.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple cautioned that Self Service Repair is intended for \"individual technicians with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices,\" and encouraged \"the vast majority of customers\" to visit a professional repair provider with certified technicians for \"the safest and most reliable way to get a repair.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe company also highlighted the significant global expansion of service locations with access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and training, as well as the growing number of Independent Repair Providers that sit alongside Apple Authorized Service Providers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Self Service Repair program will be available to users starting early next year in the U.S. and expand to additional countries throughout 2022.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/repair-program/\">repair program</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/right-to-repair/\">Right to Repair</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/self-service-repair/\">Self Service Repair</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/17/apple-launches-self-service-repair/\">Apple Announces Self Service Repair Program, Starting With iPhone 12 and 13</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-self-service-repair-program-starting-with-iphone-12-and-13.2323771/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FsEJ7QUeI8g:y0BHaOGW1ck:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FsEJ7QUeI8g:y0BHaOGW1ck:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"91b8033271bc06ac513cc30899c97f535b04ca2c0d16c9bfe52204422df7d656","category":"Apple"}
