However, both of those rumors proved to be from unreliable sources for Apple leaks, whereas Gurman is a more reputable source.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>MacRumors</em> has learned that Apple has internally tested a redesigned Control Center for iOS 18, but we cannot confirm if these changes have been finalized.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will unveil iOS 18 during its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/\">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, and the first beta should be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately after the presentation. The first public beta of iOS 18 will likely follow in July, and the update should be widely released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/control-center/\">Control Center</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-control-center-updates-rumor/\">Gurman: iOS 18 to Feature 'Updates' to Control Center</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-ios-18-to-feature-updates-to-control-center.2427819/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ffcfec02be166f81a5bed783286ac8054d92dff80c5152a69d087faf960e14a7","category":"Apple"}
