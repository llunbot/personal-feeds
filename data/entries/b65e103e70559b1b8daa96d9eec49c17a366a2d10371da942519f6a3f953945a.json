We caught up with him an evening after the race in Italy for an up-close look at the new Merida gravel bike. And a quick chat a bit about why he chose a proper gravel bike over some to the endurance road bikes you’d find in the gravel peloton. And what spares he carried in case he had a mechanical…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2023 Gravel World Champion Matej Mohorič’s unreleased Merida Silex</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_race-number-3-to-number1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_race-number-3-to-number1.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Gravel World Champion Matej Mohorič won on unreleased Merida Silex gravel race bike, race number\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_race-number-3-to-number1.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_race-number-3-to-number1-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_race-number-3-to-number1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_race-number-3-to-number1-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_race-number-3-to-number1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_race-number-3-to-number1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all photos by Cory Benson, c. Bikerumor</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As is almost <em>de rigeur</em> for pro UCI gravel race winners these days, Matej Mohorič is first and foremost known as a pro road cyclist, racing for Bahrain Victorious. Over the last few years he’s won stages in all three of the Grand Tours, plus Milan-San Remo last year. But speaking to him, it seems Mohorič is very much an off-road rider at heart. And he was pretty excited for the opportunity to put his road racing chops to the test on gravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said though, the Gravel World Championships was his last planned race of the season. And he really didn’t expect to be fighting for the win. Mohorič said he went into his first Gravel Worlds just hoping to have a good day on the bike and finish near the front.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What about this new bike?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_frameset.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_frameset.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Gravel World Championship winning Merida Silex of Slovenian Matej Mohorič\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_frameset.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_frameset-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_frameset-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_frameset-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_frameset-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_frameset-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_frameset-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The trick here was that Merida had a new bike in the works. And he jumped at the chance to try it out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Merida has released the full details just yet on the new bike. But the custom team paint job pretty obviously shouts that this is the replacement for <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/merida-silex-goes-road-new-gravel-bike-carbon-alloy/\" target=\"_blank\">their existing Silex</a>. While that versatile gravel bike seems to have been quite successful for Merida over the past 6 years, its tall headtube looks were pretty divisive for anyone looking for a performance-focused bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What apparently convinced Mohorič to race this unreleased Silex vs. Merida’s fast gravel <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-merida-scultura-endurance-finds-all-road-sweet-spot-between-gravel-road-racing/\" target=\"_blank\">endurance all-road bike</a>, or even the same <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021-merida-reacto-aero-road-bike-is-faster-more-comfortable-more-versatile-ready-for-any-race/\" target=\"_blank\">Reacto</a> that his ex-teammate Sonny Colbrelli rode to a muddy <a href=\"https://www.merida-bikes.com/en/news/detail/941/The+winner%E2%80%99s+bike+at+Paris-Roubaix\" target=\"_blank\">Paris-Roubaix win</a> in 2021, was the long-wheelbase stability of the Silex. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Bahrain-Victorious-paint-and-Slovenia-nametag.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Bahrain-Victorious-paint-and-Slovenia-nametag.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Gravel World Champion Matej Mohorič won on unreleased Merida Silex gravel race bike, Bahrain Victorious\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Bahrain-Victorious-paint-and-Slovenia-nametag.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Bahrain-Victorious-paint-and-Slovenia-nametag-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Bahrain-Victorious-paint-and-Slovenia-nametag-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Bahrain-Victorious-paint-and-Slovenia-nametag-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Bahrain-Victorious-paint-and-Slovenia-nametag-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Bahrain-Victorious-paint-and-Slovenia-nametag-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Bahrain-Victorious-paint-and-Slovenia-nametag-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s new on the bike looks like pretty much everything at first glance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But apparently, even through details like subtly more aero tube shaping, an integrated seatclamp, full internal cable routing, and dropped chainstays… the character of this upcoming Silex reboot was still about versatility. Not just racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently, this is not really a gravel race bike. Luckily nobody told Matej Mohorič that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pro roadie gravel bike setup</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_cockpit-profile.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_cockpit-profile.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Gravel World Champion Matej Mohorič won on unreleased Merida Silex gravel race bike, cockpit setup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_cockpit-profile.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_cockpit-profile-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_cockpit-profile-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_cockpit-profile-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_cockpit-profile-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_cockpit-profile-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_cockpit-profile-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_cockpit-profile-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first hint that this is a pro road racer’s setup of what might be an average Joe’s gravel bike is that incredibly long FSA stem.

And literally building up the frameset with whatever road components the team had lying around their service course at the end of the road race season. In fact, his team mechanics got this Silex prototype ready just in the last week for him. They didn’t even have time to round up a Dura-Ace powermeter crankset. So, Matej raced Gravel Worlds just based on his heartrate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Onboard gravel flat repair kit</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-inside-handlebar.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-inside-handlebar.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Gravel World Champion Matej Mohorič won on unreleased Merida Silex gravel race bike, Muc-Off tubeless repair tool inside handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-inside-handlebar.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-inside-handlebar-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-inside-handlebar-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-inside-handlebar-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-inside-handlebar-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-inside-handlebar-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-kit.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-kit.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Gravel World Champion Matej Mohorič won on unreleased Merida Silex gravel race bike, Muc-Off tubeless repair tool\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-kit.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-kit-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-kit-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-kit-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unreleased-Merida-Silex-of-2023-Gravel-World-Champion-Matej-Mohoric_Muc-Off-tubeless-repair-kit-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly though, while most road pros are used to being followed by team cars with spare bikes and capable mechanics, Matej told us how he wanted to be more self-sufficient racing gravel. Of course, if he got a flat he wouldn’t likely get super fast mechanical support anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in his bar ends were <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/muc-off-stealth-tubeless-puncture-plug-hides-another-flat-tire-fix-inside-any-handlebar/\" target=\"_blank\">Muc-Off’s Stealth Tubeless Puncture Plug</a> tire repair kit.

He won Junior Road Worlds in 2012 &amp; U23 Road Worlds in 2013. But both of those times he moved up in the ranks the season after he won those gold medals. So he never got to compete in a rainbow jersey. Now Mohorič says he won’t miss that opportunity again. And he will ride “<em>at least 2 or 3 or 4 or maybe 12</em>” gravel races next season to make sure he gets to show off a new rainbow kit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he seems pretty happy with the new bike. He even talked about what he would change with his race setup… Maybe a 2cm shorter stem. But with some negative rise to get the bars a bit lower. But that’s about it. And has already mentioned that he can’t wait until he gets one with a rainbow-themed paint job!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming soon…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://merida-bikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Merida-bikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pro-bike-check-teaser-unreleased-merida-silex-of-gravel-world-champ-matej-mohoric/\">Pro Bike Check Teaser: Unreleased Merida Silex of Gravel World Champ Matej Mohorič</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b65e103e70559b1b8daa96d9eec49c17a366a2d10371da942519f6a3f953945a","category":"Cycling"}
