Fulfill an objective while playing a game and a pop-up box will announce whatever you completed, along with both a trophy and a number of experience points. Every EGS achievement list will add up to 1,000 experience points, with smaller achievements (45 points or less) being labeled \"bronze\" and higher point counts described as \"silver,\" \"gold,\" and \"platinum.\"</p>\n<p>Epic hasn't said how these points will impact the service. \"Keep your eyes out for more updates you’ve been waiting for as we drop new social features and player rewards later this year,\" the announcement reads. Does this mean achievement points might work as currency in some fashion, akin to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/ubisoft-snubs-steam-brings-the-division-2-to-epics-games-store/\">Ubisoft</a> Connect?
