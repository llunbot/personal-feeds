He didn’t win Stage 8 – that honour fell to Dylan Teuns in a second straight success for <a href=\"/tags/bahrain-victorious\">Bahrain Victorious</a> – but he put so much time into his supposed GC rivals that it’s hard to see anyone else standing on the top stop of the podium in Paris, despite a full fortnight of racing still to come.</p>\n<p>The damage was done near the top of the 1<sup>st</sup> category Col de Romme 30km from the finish, then reinforced and magnified on the Col de la Colombiere before the downhill run into Le Grand-Bornand.</p>\n<p>Pogacar finished the 151km stage fourth, 49 seconds down on Teuns and just behind fellow breakaway survivors Ion Izagirre (Astana) and Michael Woods (Israel Start-Up Nation).</p>\n<p>But it was the time gaps behind Pogacar that mattered. Simon Yates lost 2 minutes. Jonas Vingegaard, Richard Carapaz, Alexey Lutsenko, Rigoberto Uran and Enric Mas were together in what was left of a chase group, all of 3:20 behind Pogacar.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9845/nic-dlamini-the-hero-cycling-needs\">Nic Dlamini: the hero cycling needs</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9836/cycling-an-entire-lap-of-iceland-in-one-ride\">Cycling an entire lap of Iceland in one ride</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 115: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nIt only got worse from there. Nairo Quintana lost nearly 8 minutes; Julian Alaphilippe and Richie Porte lost 18 minutes; Vincenzo Nibali and yellow jersey Mathieu van der Poel 21 minutes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/tags/geraint-thomas\" target=\"_blank\">Geraint Thomas</a> and <a href=\"/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primoz Roglic</a>? 35 minutes. Clearly both have seen their Tour prospects ruined by the effects of crashes earlier in the race. Roglic decided not to start Stage 9, another tough mountain stage with a summit finish.</p>\n<p>But this was Pogacar’s day. He may be seen as the future of the sport, but so far his 2021 Tour de France has been a near-perfect display of dominance we’ve only seen from Tour legends in their very pomp: dominate the opening time-trial, then make a statement in the first mountain stage.</p>\n<p>Here are Cyclist photographer Chris Auld’s photos from Stage 8:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9828/tour-de-france-2021-stage-8-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 29</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/tour_de_france_stage_8_01.jpg?itok=VM9e4PQp\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>29</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9828/tour-de-france-2021-stage-8-gallery\">Tour de France 2021 Stage 8 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/chris-auld\">Chris Auld</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>4 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9828%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-8-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%208%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9828%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-8-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%208%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9828%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-8-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%208%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9828%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-8-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9828/tour-de-france-2021-stage-8-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 29</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/tour_de_france_stage_8_01.jpg?itok=VM9e4PQp\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"9df75cc3b25c57a3fd4e4e7e1cce8eae2944ea97de1aeda14b6e7005f8fc6b1b","category":"Cycling"}
