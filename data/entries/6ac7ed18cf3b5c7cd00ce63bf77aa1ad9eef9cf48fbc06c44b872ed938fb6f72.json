But working together with the BH Coloma, BH-Wallonie, BMC Racing, Cannondale Factory Racing, DMT Racing, Lapierre Mavic Unity, &amp; Wilier-Pirelli Factory teams Prologo evolved the ergonomic Scratch for off-road racing demands.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_cannondale-butt.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_cannondale-butt-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Prologo Scratch NDR ergonomic XC mountain bike saddle, raceing detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_cannondale-butt-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_cannondale-butt-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_cannondale-butt-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_cannondale-butt-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_cannondale-butt-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_cannondale-butt-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_cannondale-butt.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What does that mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_top.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_top-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Prologo Scratch NDR ergonomic XC mountain bike saddle, top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_top-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_top-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_top-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_top-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_top-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_top.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the original Scratch had 3 core ergo zones – nose, mid-section &amp; tail – to suit climbing, riding flats &amp; descending, the new Scratch NDR cross-country saddle essentially can ignore descending since mountain bike downhills aren’t on the saddle. Instead, the new Scratch NDR gets a supportive tail that kicks up a bit to push against on longer pedal-ly sections, and a long &amp; flat grippy nose for stomping up the steepest climbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>XC Saddle Tech Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_details.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_details-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Prologo Scratch NDR ergonomic XC mountain bike saddle, tech details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_details-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_details-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_details-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_details-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_details-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_details.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Scratch NDR keeps the same compact fit 250x140mm dimensions of the regular Scratch. But it does start its tail a bit further back for off-rad flexibility, moving the “anatomical center” position where the rider is assumed to sit back 5mm to allow for a bit more movement over varied terrain. The two smooth rear wings also slope up a bit higher at the back with 3mm thicker EVA padding than the road saddle for more rough-surface comfort, and something to push against on longer power climbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_side-view.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"274\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_side-view-800x274.jpg\" alt=\"Prologo Scratch NDR ergonomic XC mountain bike saddle, side profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_side-view-800x274.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_side-view-297x102.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_side-view-120x41.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_side-view-768x263.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_side-view-1536x527.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_side-view-2048x702.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From the mid-section to the front though, the Prologo Scratch NDR is all-new. In order to get up the steepest technical climbs, the Scratch NDR features a longer, flat nose topped with ‘Grip Cover’ – a series of horizontally-textured ridges that help maintain grip on the mountain bike racer’s shorts so they won’t slide, more easily holding that forward position to negotiate steeper sections of the race course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the saddle, Prologo builds the Scratch NDR with a long-fiber carbon composite shell for stiffness and light weight. While this mountain bike saddle omits a complete ergonomic cutout hole to protect the rider from mud &amp; rear-tire spray, that carbon shell is cut out for pressure relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_Nack-carbon.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_Nack-carbon-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Prologo Scratch NDR ergonomic XC mountain bike saddle, Nack carbon rails\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_Nack-carbon-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_Nack-carbon-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_Nack-carbon-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_Nack-carbon-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_Nack-carbon-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_Nack-carbon.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Two versions of the saddle are offered – an ultralight &amp; ultra-stiff 166g Scratch NDR Nack with a 7×9.3mm oval nano carbon fiber composite rail structure reinforced by Kevlar &amp; aluminum components…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_TiroX-version.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_TiroX-version-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Prologo Scratch NDR ergonomic XC mountain bike saddle, TiroX tubular steel rails\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_TiroX-version-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_TiroX-version-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_TiroX-version-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_TiroX-version-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_TiroX-version-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_TiroX-version.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>…or a still light but more comfortable 217g Scratch NDR TiroX saddle with lightweight tubular steel alloy rails that is super strong and better at vibration damping.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Prologo Scratch NDR – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_photo-by-mattia-ragni_racing-down.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_photo-by-mattia-ragni_racing-down-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Prologo Scratch NDR ergonomic XC mountain bike saddle, racing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_photo-by-mattia-ragni_racing-down-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_photo-by-mattia-ragni_racing-down-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_photo-by-mattia-ragni_racing-down-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_photo-by-mattia-ragni_racing-down-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_photo-by-mattia-ragni_racing-down-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_photo-by-mattia-ragni_racing-down-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prologo-Scratch-NDR-ergonomic-XC-mountain-bike-saddle_photo-by-mattia-ragni_racing-down.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption><em>photo by Mattia Ragni</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Prologo mountain bike racing saddle officially gets its debut tomorrow at Sea Otter, but it is already available online to buy directly from Prologo.it or their partner retail bike shops.
