href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgiro-latch-cycling-shoe-mens\">Giro Latch</a> is deserving of high praise. This relatively new model provides excellent grip through the Tack rubber outsole, a predictable, muted pedal feel, and a balanced sole stiffness in a comfortable package. It also comes in a <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgiro-latch-cycling-shoe-womens\">women’s version</a> in smaller sizes and a few different color options.</p><p></p><p>It’s hard not to draw comparisons to the ubiquitous Five Ten Freerider Pro, as the Latch is very similar in looks, protection, materials, and construction. The Latch, however, is a tad narrower through the midfoot and heel, has a lower footbed, and is slightly stiffer. The soft, mostly seamless microfiber upper provides a high level of comfort straight out of the box. The heel cup is fairly low profile but provides a secure heel hold, likely due to the very good midfoot fit. A firm heel cup and light padding around the ankle combine with a reinforced toe box to provide average foot protection that should work well for most riding scenarios short of full-on DH riding. The Latch uses a standard insole design that works well enough, though those with high arches may be left wanting a little more support or an aftermarket footbed. </p><p></p><p>The Latch delivers an exceptional feel while riding. The sole is slightly stiffer than most other models and the <em>Mute Foam</em> midsole does a great job absorbing trail chatter and smoothing out the ride. While thin with a low stack height, the stiffer sole is supportive, doesn’t fold over the pedals at the midfoot, and provides solid pedaling efficiency. The Latch is still remarkably tactile but feels more muted, controlled, and efficient than softer flexing competitors. While great on the pedals and reasonable for shorter walks, the low-profile tread design of the Latch doesn’t provide the best grip while hiking in loose soils or mud and the stiffer sole can feel a little blocky on longer hikes.</p><p></p><p>The Latch uses Giro’s <em>Tack</em> rubber outsole, which provides outstanding grip/traction on the pedals. In fact, it seems at least as grippy as Five Ten’s Stealth rubber, which is generally considered the gold standard. Unexpected pedal slips were a non-issue while wearing the Latch whether descending or climbing, and the grip is impressive, confidence-inspiring, and trustworthy in all situations and conditions. The Latch uses a friction grip approach, with 9 low profile pentagons arranged in repeating hexagonal patterns, which Giro calls the Gamma tread pattern. </p><p></p><p>The Latch’s microfiber upper is more water resistant than a canvas shoe but isn’t explicitly intended for super wet conditions riding. Perforations in the microfiber uppers provide respectable breathability, in line with similar models. While testing during a very rainy, hot, humid weather cycle, they weren’t unreasonably hot or wet and they provide a good balance of breathability and weather resistance for normal weather and riding conditions. The smooth microfiber upper dries quickly and is very easy to clean with a quick wipe down.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgiro-latch-cycling-shoe-mens\">Giro Latch</a> is well-positioned to be a direct competitor to the venerable Freerider Pro, but not a direct copy – though they are similar on paper. The on-trail differences are subtle – the Latch is slightly stiffer, sits a little bit lower, and feels a touch more stable and efficient on the pedals.

This all-new model does away with a traditional tongue and instead uses a stretch “slip-tongue” that provides a super comfortable fit along with great grip from the Max Grip outsole. The Accomplice comes in both men’s and <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FRide-Concepts-Womens-Accomplice-Shoe\">women’s versions</a>, and in addition to the lace-up version we tested, the Accomplice Boa uses a Boa closure and retails for $140.</p><p></p><p>The Accomplice is designed around Ride Concepts’ low volume last which they claim is intended to provide a secure fit without the need to crank down on the laces. The flexibility of the nylon upper is comfortable right off the bat and the snug fit of the sock-like slip tongue really hugs the entire foot and locks it and the heel into place. The large heel loop helps with slipping the sock-like design on and the feel on the foot is reminiscent of a comfy skate shoe, though the Accomplice is relatively low-volume and low-profile overall. Like the Tallac Boa, we found the height of the toe box to be a touch lower than similarly sized models from other brands, though it broke in nicely after a couple of rides and didn’t pose any further fit or comfort issues. </p><p></p><p>The light amount of TPU reinforcement at the toe box is slightly less than shoes like the Five Ten Freerider Pro or Giro Latch but provides adequate protection for most trail riding scenarios. The nylon upper is padded consistently throughout the inside of the shoe, which adds to the high comfort but makes the Accomplice one of the warmer shoes tested. Though you can feel some air passing through the nylon upper, the cushioned lining and sock-like fit tend to trap heat and moisture a bit more than other shoes. And while it looks great, the nylon material absorbs moisture a bit more readily in super wet conditions. Likewise, the woven texture tends to trap dust and dirt and is generally harder to clean than smoother materials. </p><p></p><p>On the trail, the Accomplice is very similar in stiffness and power transfer to the Five Ten Freerider Pro – it’s a medium flexing sole with a very tactile feel and flex that drapes slightly over the pedals when weighted. While the softer flex may marginally reduce pedaling efficiency, it’s a familiar feel that many riders prefer and already get along with. Like the Tallac Boa, the level of pedal traction provided by the Max Grip outsole and hexagonal tread is impressive. Comparatively speaking, the grip offered is nearly as good as the Freerider Pro or the Giro Latch. Off the bike, the Accomplice is comfortable for pushing the bike short distances or leaving on while you run errands after a ride. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FRide-Concepts-Mens-Accomplice-Shoe\">Ride Concepts Accomplice</a> is offered at a fair price and it tops the comfort charts with its sock-like fit, and the on-trail performance is right up there as well. It’s a solid contender as a very comfy all-rounder and fans of models like the Five Ten Freerider or Giro Latch should consider them when it’s time for their next pair.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FRide-Concepts-Mens-Accomplice-Shoe\">Check Price at Jenson USA</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Accomplice-glamour-shot-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Accomplice-glamour-shot-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Ride Concepts Accomplice flat pedals shoes product shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Accomplice-glamour-shot-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Accomplice-glamour-shot-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Accomplice-glamour-shot-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Accomplice-glamour-shot-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Accomplice-glamour-shot-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Accomplice-glamour-shot-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Accomplice-glamour-shot-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Accomplice-glamour-shot-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Accomplice is a reasonably priced new model from Ride Concepts, that looks good, performs well, and is super comfortable with a sock-like “slip-tongue” design.

They are true to size, but after testing them alongside a selection of other shoes, it became clear that they are a little higher volume in comparison to the Giro Latch or Fox Union, for example. The toe box is roomy but not cavernous. They should work well for those with average to slightly above average width feet, although riders with narrower feet may need to lace them a bit tighter to lock down the heel. </p><p></p><p>The Freerider Pro is a comfortable shoe and has a non-existent break-in period – the synthetic upper, midsole, outsole, and Ortholite liner are supple out of the box. The upper is perforated at the toe box and provides a reasonable amount of breathability. The water resistance is average for a riding shoe, it handles puddle splashes and light drizzles just fine, and the synthetic upper dries fairly quickly. It isn’t a heavily armored shoe, but the stiff and lightly padded heel cup and the reinforced toe box provide adequate protection for most riding.</p><p></p><p>On the pedals, the Freerider Pro has an outstanding feel – which is the primary reason people love them. The thin sole has a low stack height and is profiled to give the toes a slight lift, making being on the balls of your feet the neutral position, which interfaces well with most pedals. The Stealth S1 rubber outsole is the gold standard for friction-based traction and they certainly don’t lack grip. The grip is consistent at all temperatures and on all terrain – it’s a tacky rubber that sticks well to the pedal pins and other surfaces off the bike. The sole isn’t super stiff, instead flexing a little around the pedal body and providing a tactile feel. It is worth mentioning that the Stealth rubber does show wear marks from the pedal pins more quickly than other outsoles, though, in our experience, they continue to grip well and generally last for a season or two depending on how much you ride. </p><p></p><p>While not overly flexy, the sole of the Freerider Pro is similar to the Ride Concepts Accomplice and comparatively slightly softer than the Giro Latch, Specialized 2FO DH, or Ride Concepts Tallac Boa. While those stiffer shoes will provide marginally more efficient pedaling, the Freerider Pro offers a little more tactility and a balanced flex that so many riders have come to know and love. Off the bike, they are easy enough to walk around in and fine for quick hikes or sessioning features, but there are better options for adventure rides with big hike-a-bikes, like the Five Ten Trailcross XT, for example. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F113263%2Ffive-ten-freerider-pro-mountain-bike-shoes-mens\">Five Ten Freerider Pro</a> has enjoyed a long reign of dominance as one of the best flat pedal shoes on the market and is still a great option. The Stealth rubber outsole provides excellent traction and balances the softer feel and roomy fit to be a versatile shoe that will serve most riders well. There are stiffer and more protective options, but the excellent pedal grip and balanced ride feel of the Freerider Pro make it a safe bet.  </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F113263%2Ffive-ten-freerider-pro-mountain-bike-shoes-mens\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffive-ten-freerider-pro-cycling-shoe-mens\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Five Ten Freerider Pro flat pedal shoes product shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>A classic, and still one of the best.

The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fride-concepts-tallac-boa-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Tallac Boa</a> is among their most recent additions to the lineup and it is a uniquely styled shoe with looks reminiscent of some hiking shoes. It comes in both the Boa version we tested, as well as the more traditional<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fride-concepts-tallac-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\"> Tallac with a lace closure</a> that retails for $160. Ride Concepts also makes a women’s version, called the Flume, that comes in smaller sizes and different colors in both the <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FRide-Concepts-Womens-Flume-BOA-Shoes%3Firclickid%3DwJmQIJQqWxyNW4sWV7XKKyibUkF3Iu2hT34c0Q0%26irgwc%3D1%26utm_medium%3DIMPACT\">Boa-equipped</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fride-concepts-flume-cycling-shoe-womens\">lace-up</a> versions.  </p><p></p><p>At $190, the Tallac Boa includes some premium materials and components – a continuous, breathable, and fairly water-resistant welded Cordura upper, Boa lacing, Max Grip outsoles, and D30 impact foam panels built into the insoles. Ride Concepts calls the fit medium volume and they feel very comfortable and secure right out of the box. The Boa closure and velcro strap over the toes are quick and easy to use, making it easy to get consistent tension across the entire foot, and a precise fit. The Boa system didn’t present us with any issues and worked particularly well in the wet conditions encountered during testing, but those who are wary of them will be happy to know the Tallac comes with the aforementioned lace closure as well.  </p><p></p><p>We found the Tallac Boa to fit true to size, although the height of the toe box felt a touch restrictive at first. The Cordura upper material did break in pretty quickly, however, providing a bit more space for the toes to be comfortable. The uppers have a rugged and durable feel while still providing a great balance of breathability and water resistance. The material allows more air to pass through than microfiber or TPU uppers on other shoes, helping to cool the feet in hot, humid conditions. Still, we found them to resist water impressively well while testing in some seriously rainy and wet weather. The gusseted tongue also helps keep dust, debris, and mud from making its way inside. They are not waterproof, mind you, but they stand up very well to sloppy conditions.</p><p></p><p>Intended for trail, all-mountain, and enduro-style riding, the level of protection is slightly above average, with a stiff heel and reinforced wraparound toe box. The Tallac isn’t a straight-up downhill shoe like the Specialized 2FO DH Flat, but provides a similar level of protection as the Five Ten Freerider Pro or the Giro Latch and more than the Ride Concepts Accomplice, for comparison.</p><p></p><p>On the pedals, the Tallac Boa has a moderately stiff sole and very strong traction. The stack height is a little taller than most other models we tested which reduces the sensitivity or tactile feel on the pedals somewhat, but they provide ample support and great pedaling efficiency while the EVA midsole and D30 insole help to mute trail feedback and keep the shoes from getting bounced. The Max Grip rubber is perhaps a touch less tacky feeling than Five Ten’s Stealth S1, Giro Tack, or Specialized SlipNot ST, but when combined with the aggressive hexagonal tread design, it offers tons of traction on the pedals. </p><p></p><p>Another place the Tallac Boa shines is when the terrain forces you off the bike. Despite its stiffness on the pedals, the sole has been designed to walk well, and the overall more aggressive tread and reverse hex tread on the toe and heel provide great grip when your ride turns adventurous and you find yourself pushing your bike up or down the hill or scrambling up to a rocky vista point. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fride-concepts-tallac-boa-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Ride Concepts Tallac Boa</a> is a nicely balanced flat pedal shoe with a well-rounded on and off-the-bike performance. The Max Grip sole is comparable in traction to any competitor and one that we’ll be pulling out for long trail rides, wet or unreasonably humid days, or high-impact days at the bike park. While the stiffer sole and high stack may be a turn-off to those who prioritize pedal sensitivity and tactility, the Tallac Boa is a great option that turned out to be a very pleasant surprise.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fride-concepts-tallac-boa-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Tallac-Boa-weather-resistance-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Tallac-Boa-weather-resistance-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Ride Concepts Tallac Boa flat pedal shoes wet and muddy on a test ride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Tallac-Boa-weather-resistance-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Tallac-Boa-weather-resistance-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Tallac-Boa-weather-resistance-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Tallac-Boa-weather-resistance-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Tallac-Boa-weather-resistance-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Tallac-Boa-weather-resistance-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Tallac-Boa-weather-resistance-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ride-Concepts-Tallac-Boa-weather-resistance-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Tallac Boa and its Cordura uppers offer a surprisingly good balance of weather resistance and breathability, on top of excellent pedal grip, support, and hike-ability.

Not only is the SlipNot ST one of the tackiest rubber compounds on the market, but the high level of foot protection, thick, damp midsole, and durable leather and textile upper make the 2FO DH a standout for DH and super aggressive riding. </p><p></p><p>The 2FO DH Flat uses Specialized’s <em>Body Geometry</em> fit, which has three main components. The Varus Wedge, longitudinal molded arch support, and Metatarsal Button are intended to provide better alignment of the foot and lower leg to enhance comfort and power. While that is hard to quantify, we found the platform and fit of the 2FO DH Flat very comfortable for longer days in the saddle and the feet felt fresher after long rides or when riding rougher terrain. In terms of fit, the 2FO DH Flat feels like a shoe built for high performance on the bike. The heel pocket holds the heel securely and the laces over the mid foot make it easy to get adequate tension. The forefoot is a little roomier, but it is worth noting that the toe box is tapered a bit more at the front than some other models, and if you have notably wide toes, you’ll want to try these on before you buy to ensure you get the right size.</p><p></p><p>As a DH shoe, it comes as little surprise that the 2FO DH offers quite a bit of foot protection. The toe box is heavily reinforced, and the medial ankle cuff is raised to add a bit of coverage from ankle strikes. The cushioned EVA midsole provides a good level of vibration dampening and is paired with an internal shank that adds stiffness and stability. Pedaling efficiency is solid given the stiffer sole and they don’t fold over the pedal the way some softer models do. Conversely, they don’t provide the same level of tactility as softer flexing shoes, but there is still enough feedback and pedal feel while delivering smooth and consistent power transfer. And, while they are marketed as a DH shoe, they also work well for all-day pedaling missions.</p><p></p><p>The SlipNot ST (Super Tacky) rubber is extremely tacky and grippy. If grip is your highest priority, the 2FO DH Flat has you covered. These shoes have the “stickiest” feel on the pedals of any shoe in this round of testing, providing a truly locked-in feel. They are so grippy, in fact, that they require very deliberate movements to reposition the feet. While this level of grip may not be ideal for those who like a bit of foot mobility, it is truly impressive and will definitely appeal to those who want to feel glued to the pedal pins. This is particularly great for their intended use, where you don’t want to worry about blowing off the pedals at high speeds in aggressive terrain. </p><p></p><p>During some particularly wet testing rides, the leather/textile upper proved to be surprisingly water-resistant and was easily one of the best at keeping the feet dry in sub-optimal riding conditions. Still, they remained relatively breathable despite the small and minimal ventilating perforations. While the uppers don’t let a lot of airflow into the shoe, the porous structure of the Xpel mesh lining and footbed does a solid job of transferring heat and moisture away from the feet while also providing a bit of cushioning. To be clear, they aren’t exactly airy like the Five Ten Trailcross XT or the Ride Concepts Tallac Boa, but they keep the feet quite comfortable. </p><p></p><p>For a burly, extremely grippy, protective shoe that manages water resistance and breathability quite well, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-2fo-dh-flat-mountain-bike-shoes\">Specialized 2FO DH Flat</a> is an excellent choice.

href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F226538%2Fshimano-gf8-gore-tex-mountain-bike-shoes-mens%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Shimano GF800 GTX</a> is a flat pedal shoe you’ll want to check out. Featuring the same TORBAL 2.0 midsole, ULTREAD GF outsole, and raised medial ankle support found on the GF600, the GF800 GTX adds BOA L6 cable laces and a full Gore-Tex liner/ankle cuff to optimize them for cold and wet weather conditions. The craftsmanship is impeccable, and say what you will about the aesthetic, but we think they look great too.</p><p></p><p>The overall fit of the GF800s is very similar to the GF600s, although they have some different features. The fit is mid-volume and relaxed, similar to the Five Ten Freerider Pro, and easy to fit thick socks into on cold days. The Gore-Tex lined synthetic upper is perforated above the toes and outer mid-foot, but not through the waterproof membrane, which keeps moisture from seeping in while allowing some breathability. The BOA L6 cable is well executed, with no hot spots and even tension across the metacarpals, and it has a “bash guard” that should help protect it from damage. Additionally, the Boa is easy to use with cold, gloved hands, and it handles water and mud much better than absorbent laces. The lower lace (or BOA cable) cover also does a nice job keeping water out of the edges of the “tongue”, which is also backed up by the continuous Gore-Tex liner. </p><p></p><p>The medial ankle is raised for additional support and impact protection with a tall, supple, sock-style Gore-tex ankle cuff that helps to keep water, mud, and debris from entering the top of the shoe. Slipping the foot into the sock-style liner takes some getting used to – pull tabs at the front and rear of the ankle help – and the liner is not constricting, sagging, or irritating while riding. When worn with long enough pants, you can tuck the upper cuff of the shoe under the pants to keep water from running down your legs and into the shoes. Whether riding on super wet days or standing in puddles, the GF800s thoroughly impressed us with their weather resistance, and despite their cold-weather pedigree, we found them to be comfortable in temperatures up to around 70° F. </p><p></p><p>Like with the GF600s, the sole is moderate in flex and conforms nicely to the pedals when weighted. The hexagonal tread lugs have deep channels that grab hold of pedal pins, and the ULTREAD GF rubber is grippier than previous Shimano soles. While they still aren’t the <em>tackiest</em> soles, they provide a consistent and predictable grip with a bit more of a mechanical connection. The TORBAL 2.0 midsole is a standout feature of Shimano’s new GF line that allows the heel to twist torsionally while keeping the sole under the toe box flat, making corner initiation easy and intuitive, and, in our opinion, enhancing the feeling of grip and control. </p><p></p><p>For winter and rainstorm warriors, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F226538%2Fshimano-gf8-gore-tex-mountain-bike-shoes-mens%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Shimano GF800 GTX</a> is a great choice to ensure your feet stay cozy, dry, and warm. We were impressed with the TORBAL 2.0 midsole’s torsional flex with all of Shimano’s new models and, while the ULTREAD GF outsole is not the tackiest rubber on the market, it provides reliable enough traction that we will be pulling the GF800 GTX on our feet for wet and cold rides on all types of terrain. If you are a Type II fun enthusiast, we recommend checking out the GF800 to keep you rolling through the toughest conditions.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F226538%2Fshimano-gf8-gore-tex-mountain-bike-shoes-mens%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Check Price at REI</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Standing in a puddle in the Shimano GF800 GTX flat pedal shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-1-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Shimano’s new GF800 GTX shoes are ready to take on the toughest conditions of the fall, winter, and spring.

This reasonably priced model looks like a casual, cup-sole sneaker for kicking around town, but maintains an excellent feel on the bike through the Specialized Body Geometry design, low profile upper, low stack height, and grippy SlipNot ST outsole. While the Method feels a little bit under-gunned during rowdy trail and downhill riding, it quickly became the go-to choice of choice for laps on the local pump track, dirt jumps, and more casual trail rides (especially any that ended at the pub).</p><p></p><p>Like Specialized’s downhill-focused 2FO DH Flat, the 2FO Method employs Specialized Body Geometry fit with a varus wedge, longitudinal arch, and metatarsal button. These features seem a little less dramatic/pronounced on the Method – it feels like a normal shoe (Vans come to mind) with some slight tweaks for better performance on the bike. Like other Specialized shoes, the Method fit more or less true to size. The toe box is a bit more tapered than some other brands, but the canvas upper is quite forgiving and broke in quickly. The internal heel counter works well and the feel of the low stack height and cup sole feels great on and off the pedals. Still, these wouldn’t be the first choice for long hike-a-bikes, but they are certainly comfortable enough for walking around town.</p><p></p><p>The 2FO Method has the most flexible sole of the all models tested, but not excessively soft. The overall sole stiffness and pedaling efficiency is a touch lower than the Freerider Pro, for example, but more in line with the Five Ten Freerider (not the Pro version) or Five Ten Sleuth. While this level of sole flex might cause some foot fatigue on a long, pedal-heavy trail ride, it is perfectly appropriate for the pump track, dirt jumps, shorter neighborhood trail riding, or anyone who prefers a softer flex and higher level of pedal feel. The SlipNot ST outsole is very tacky, much like the 2FO DH Flat, providing a trustworthy grip in most situations. Interestingly, we found it could be overwhelmed in super aggressive terrain or situations with high-frequency impact, primarily due to the softer, thin sole providing less support and dampening. That said, we found the grip and pedal feel to be great for their intended purpose, though they could be a little too grippy for those who prefer greater foot mobility.</p><p></p><p>The canvas material of the upper is not water resistant, nor does it promise to be. It readily soaks up moisture and dries slower than microfiber, TPU, or Condura uppers, making these shoes less than ideal for riding in wet conditions. Breathability is fair, slightly less than a pair of canvas Vans due to the thin layer of padding throughout. That said, they work well enough on hot days, assuming it’s also dry. </p><p></p><p>Though we can’t comment on long-term durability yet, our test pair is holding up well so far. Given the canvas uppers, we expect they could be more prone to damage from abrasion and may wear out a bit quicker than some models made with tougher, more technical materials. Still, they seem well constructed and we expect them to have an average lifespan.</p><p></p><p>While the <a href=\"https://pros-closet.sjv.io/c/2227671/848557/11861?subId1=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theproscloset.com%2Fproducts%2Fspecialized-2fo-method-mountain-bike-shoes\">2FO Method</a> isn’t our top pick for aggressive trail riding or wet days, they are a great choice for playing around on the bike and can seamlessly transition from your neighborhood ride, pump track, or dirt jump session to dinner, a friend’s house, or the bar.

If you ride in truly wet and sloppy conditions with any regularity, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F195394%2Ffive-ten-trailcross-gtx-mountain-bike-shoes-mens\">Five Ten Trailcross GTX</a> is a shoe you should consider. With a similar design to the summer and dry conditions-oriented Trailcross XT, the GTX version ups the ante of weather protection with a full Gore-Tex membrane and a tall neoprene ankle cuff to keep the elements at bay. </p><p></p><p>Much like the other models in Five Ten’s Trailcross line, the GTX has more of a running shoe or light hiker look than your typical flat pedal shoes. For some, the looks alone will be a non-starter, while others may find the aesthetic to be a refreshing departure from the norm. Looks aside, Five Ten still aims to pack all the performance you’d expect from a flat pedal shoe in a package made to stand up to rain, mud, slop, and cold temperatures. </p><p></p><p>The fit of the Trailcross GTX is similar to that of the XT model and more akin to a running shoe than other models the brand makes, like the Freerider Pro. They fit true to size, but the toe box is a bit more tapered overall, comparatively speaking. Still, they have a fairly average width and volume, but it might be worth trying these on if you’ve got wider-than-average feet or toes.</p><p></p><p>One of the most important aspects of any flat pedal shoe is grip, and Five Ten gave the Trailcross GTX a Stealth Phantom outsole that uses dual rubber compounds. While it is a bit less grippy than the Stealth S1 rubber on the Freerider Pro, we still found them to provide a confidence-inspiring level of grip no matter the conditions, aided by the dotty tread design and the moderate stiffness of the EVA midsole. Like other Trailcross models, the GTX also performs quite well off the bike with a heavily rockered toe and directional sole flex that allows for a very natural gait. The wider tread lugs at the toe and heel also work well to optimize grip when hiking on a wide range of surfaces and conditions. </p><p></p><p>The waterproofness of the Trailcross GTX got put to the test during a Scottish winter on the feet of Bikerumor’s Jessie-May Morgan. Through months of riding in notoriously wet and cold conditions, the Gore-Tex membrane managed to keep her feet dry, even when subjected to additional off-the-bike hose tests. Of course, it is still possible for some moisture to enter the shoes through the top of the neoprene ankle gasket, but when layered properly with the cuff of your riding pants over the gasket, they do a better job of keeping your feet dry than any other flat pedal shoes we’ve tried. On top of that, the Gore-Tex membrane breathes fairly well, helping evacuate perspiration, and we found the additional lining in the shoe helps the feet stay warm even in temperatures just above the freezing mark. That said, they aren’t ideal for riding in hot temperatures.</p><p></p><p>If your riding doesn’t stop when the seasons change, the temperatures drop, and precipitation starts to fall, then you should check out the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F195394%2Ffive-ten-trailcross-gtx-mountain-bike-shoes-mens\">Five Ten Trailcross GTX</a>.

href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffox-racing-union-flat-moutain-bike-shoe-mens\">Union Flat</a> is the model designed for use with flat pedals. It is similar in form, feel, and performance to the Giro Latch or Five Ten Freerider Pro – a good thing, as those are two of the best flat pedal shoes available today. The Union Flat sets itself apart from those shoes with its tough, rubbery upper, thin sole, and tacky Ultratac rubber outsole that can hold its own against any direct competitor. Fox also just released the <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FFOX-UNION-CANVAS-SHOE\">Union Canvas</a> which shares the same overall design but has a canvas upper and a lower price of just $120. </p><p></p><p>The Union Flat is a unisex model that fits true to length in US sizing and has an overall lower volume fit. Similar through the midfoot to the Giro Latch but with a narrower toe box, and less roomy overall than the Five Ten Freerider Pro. Though they are lower volume, the general feel on the foot is reminiscent of both the aforementioned shoes and the level of protection is similar, maybe a touch higher with the tough TPU upper.  </p><p></p><p>With a moderate sole stiffness, pedaling efficiency is similar to the Freerider Pro – stiff enough to be problem-free on most rides and with a nice tactile pedal feel. Riders looking for a slightly stiffer sole might lean towards the Giro Latch, but it was rare for the sole to fold over the pedals and lose support. The Union has a thin sole with a low stack height, which brings your feet closer to the pedals, and the slight flex in the sole helps them conform to the pedal shape for stability and control. Off the bike, the rockered profile and slight flex through the toes make them comfortable enough for short walks and hikes, but the Union is by no means a crossover bike/hike shoe, nor is it intended to be.</p><p></p><p>While isn’t meant to be a waterproof shoe, the one-piece welded upper is great on wet days. Some moisture can get in through the ventilation perforations, but otherwise, they shrug off mud, puddle splashes, and light rain much better than most. In normal wet riding conditions, the Union is a great choice that will keep your feet and socks dry longer than most other non-waterproof options, similar to the Ride Concepts Tallac Boa. Strong water resistance through the rubbery, welded upper does come at the cost of less breathability than some other shoes. The rubbery upper excels in keeping water out – which means it does keep some self-generated heat and moisture in.</p><p></p><p>As the flat pedal shoe market continues to mature, more brands have begun to crack the rubber code and challenge Five-Ten’s dominance in the grip department. Fox’s Ultratrac sole is an example of this – we found the traction of the Unions comparable to Ride Concept’s Max Grip compound and Five Ten’s Stealth S1, some of the grippiest options on the market. The tacky, slow-rebound rubber and slight damping from the EVA midsole provide reliable and predictable grip on the pedals in conditions ranging from dry to historically wet. </p><p></p><p>Riders looking for a versatile, grippy, and relatively water-resistant flat pedal shoe with a great pedal feel should consider the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffox-racing-union-flat-moutain-bike-shoe-mens\">Fox Union Flat</a>, especially those with a slimmer foot or who ride in damp conditions frequently. The low platform height provides a tactile pedal feel the Ultratac outsole is competitively grippy with other popular models. While there are stiffer and more protective shoes out there, the Union is a strong contender that can cover the bases from everyday trail riding to the bike park and is an exciting addition to the flat pedal shoe market from Fox.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a

pair of the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fshimano-gf600-mtb-flat-shoe-mens\">GF600</a> flat pedal shoes. With a raised toe, heavily perforated synthetic leather upper, and ULTREAD GF rubber outsole, the GF600 is positioned to be a versatile flat pedal shoe for all types of riding and a direct competitor to shoes like the Giro Latch, Five Ten Freerider Pro, or Fox Union Flat. We found it to be an improvement over previous generations of Shimano shoes with a unique feel provided by the TORBAL 2.0 midsole, which allows for easier heel motion in torsion.</p><p></p><p>Out of the box, the quality of construction is immediately apparent. There are no loose ends on the stitching, no glue flashing where the outsole meets the upper, and the laces are high quality with minimal stretch, even if they are a tad long. They have a relaxed, medium-volume fit, though e found they run a tad larger overall than other shoes we tested in the same size. The heavily perforated synthetic leather uppers provide better-than-average breathability and water resistance in line with similarly constructed shoes. The level of protection is relatively standard for all-purpose trail riding shoes, with a reinforced toe box and tough outsole material. The raised medial ankle cuff provides a bit of additional support and light protection from crank or frame strikes.</p><p></p><p>The hexagonal sole pattern of the ULTREAD GF outsole is deeper than most and gives a more mechanical style of traction that really grabs onto the pins when they are nestled into the channels, but the traction can be a tad unpredictable when they are not. Due to this, they felt a bit more sensitive to foot positioning, and repositioning the feet could be a little trickier when the pins were deep in the channels. That said, the level of grip was good and an improvement over past Shimano soles. They still aren’t quite as tacky as Five Ten Stealth S1, Specialized SlipNot, or Giro Tack outsoles, but more in line with Ride Concepts MaxGrip and Fox Ultratac. </p><p></p><p>The moderate flex of the GF600s is very similar to the Five Ten Freerider Pro, which seems relatively standard across <em>most</em> flat pedal shoes. This allows the sole to flex around the pedal slightly which seemed to enhance their grip when descending with consistent pressure on the pedals. That said, they did seem a bit more prone to bouncing when the feet were lighter on the pedals, mostly during climbs. Where the flex is unique on the GF600 is when the shoe is in torsion. Shimano’s TORBAL 2.0 for flat pedal shoes uses slits on the outer edge of the internal shank to tune twisting motion, allowing the heel to twist while keeping the sole under the toe box flat. While this might sound a little gimmicky, we found it to be quite noticeable. Initiating turns and maintaining the proper body position when holding turns felt more natural and the torsional flexibility and slightly raised medial ankle cuff proved to be a good combination. </p><p></p><p>While the ULTREAD GF outsole doesn’t provide the outright traction of the tackiest compounds, it’s grippy enough, and combined with the Torbal 2.0 flex, the new <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fshimano-gf600-mtb-flat-shoe-mens\">Shimano GF600</a> is a great option for anyone seeking a shoe with torsional forgiveness. They look like your standard flat pedal shoe with minimal branding, but the feel is noticeably different in turns and they are a marked improvement over past Shimano models that is worthy of consideration.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fshimano-gf600-mtb-flat-shoe-mens\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcrank-brothers-stamp-boa-cycling-shoe-mens\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCrankbrothers Stamp Boa\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$180</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>664 g (pair, size 7 US / 39.5 EU)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Upper Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Rubbery Upper (70% PU, 25% Polyester, 5% PU Film)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Outsole</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Match MC2 Rubber</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Closure</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Boa L6, low friction wire, velcro strap at top</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Size Tested</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>7 US Mens  / 39.5 EU</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Whole: 5 – 14 US, Half: 5.5 – 12.5 US</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Boa.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1068\" height=\"712\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Boa.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Flat Pedal Mountain Bike Shoes of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Boa.jpeg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Boa-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Boa-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Boa-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Boa-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Boa-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Exceptional fit and feel on foot</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Great pedal feel from raised toe sole profile and medium flex</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Moderate breathability and great water resistance</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Solid mid-range level of protection</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lower level of traction/grip</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>More expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Paul Clauss</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Crankbrothers started making mountain bike shoes a few years ago with flat pedal and clipless models that share names with their pedal models. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcrank-brothers-stamp-boa-cycling-shoe-mens\">Crankbrothers Stamp Boa</a> is the top-of-the-line model in the range of three flat pedal shoes that are designed to work as a system with their Stamp flat pedal line. These fancy kicks feature a sleek profile, a great fit, easy adjustability, and a middle-of-the-road level of protection and stiffness. The tread design is optimized to work best with the platform shape and pin layout of Crankbrothers Stamp pedals. Although the Match MC2 outsole rubber isn’t as grippy as the outsoles on most other shoes we tested, they do, in fact, work better with Stamp pedals, and riders who appreciate a little easier foot mobility might still want to check out the Stamp Boa for their great fit, form, and finish qualities. The Boa version is the most expensive at $180, but they are also offered in <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcrank-brothers-stamp-speedlace-cycling-shoe-mens\">Speed Lace</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcrank-brothers-stamp-lace-cycling-shoe-mens\">Lace versions</a> that cost $150 and $130, respectively.</p><p></p><p>The Stamp is a very comfortable shoe right out of the box. Laces are still the dominant closure system for flat pedal shoes, but Boa dials are becoming more common and they make it very easy to get the shoes on and off and fine-tune the fit. The Stamp shoes fit true to size and have a relatively average width. Once they are on your feet, they feel very secure and it is easy to lock down the heel and get a very precise fit with the Boa system and velcro strap. The rubbery upper is supple and conforms nicely to the feet while the fully wraparound armored toe box and generously padded heel provide a mid-high level of foot protection. The toe is rockered significantly, which gives a very good feel on the pedals. </p><p></p><p>While the rubbery upper of the Stamp looks like it could be quite hot, the mesh panels and toe perforations provide a pleasant level of breathability. The rubber-coated upper repels water very well and the mesh panels have a hydrophobic coating and don’t easily soak through, making the Stamp a solid choice for damp rides. The uppers also have a durable feel and shrug off abrasion, suggesting they will also have a long lifespan.</p><p></p><p>As mentioned previously, the tread pattern on the Stamp shoe is designed to work with the Stamp pedals, though Crankbrothers states it should work well with any pedal. The Stamp pedals come in 2 platform sizes, with the small versions recommended for shoe sizes 5-10 US, and large sizes for 10-15 US. As we noticed when testing our size 7 US shoes, the deeper channels in the Match MC2 rubber outsole match up quite well with the small Crankbrothers Stamp 7 pedal, putting the pins within the channel and providing more of a mechanical connection to the pedals. </p><p></p><p>In addition to the Crankbrothers Stamp 7, we tested them with the grippy Nukeproof Sam Hill Horizon Pro Enduro pedals. While the traction was acceptable on both pedals, it is not at the level of the grippier options, resulting in more foot bouncing, particularly in rougher, faster terrain. The traction was more reliable on the Stamp 7 pedals, where you can feel the pins locked into the channels, but on either set of pedals, the overall level of friction grip was not competitive with grippier compounds. </p><p></p><p>However, if you feel <em>too stuck </em>on some of the stickier compounds or just like to be able to reposition your feet more easily, the <a

Stamp Boa</a> is an otherwise outstanding shoe, even with the lower overall traction.</p><p></p><p>For more information, read our <a

href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffive-ten-trailcross-xt-cycling-shoe-mens\">Five Ten Trailcross XT</a> is a fairly unique shoe that is advertised to be “as comfortable on the pedals as they are hiking.” They have more of a running sneaker look and feel, a comfortable fit, a very breathable mesh upper, and great walkability. While their on-bike performance is a little different than other models, it’s important to remember their intended use as a “crossover” shoe. They come in a <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffive-ten-trailcross-xt-cycling-shoe-womens\">women’s version</a>, and Five Ten makes other Trailcross models including the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Ffive-ten-trailcross-mid-pro-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Mid Pro</a> with a taller cuff and additional ankle protection, and the waterproof <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F195394%2Ffive-ten-trailcross-gtx-mountain-bike-shoes-mens\">GTX version</a> with a Gore-Tex membrane.</p><p></p><p>Right out of the box, the Trailcross XT fits like a comfortable sneaker. Given the sneaker-esque style, it has a lower volume fit and slimmer toe box compared to the Freerider Pro. Still, the mesh upper is relatively forgiving and accommodating and doesn’t require a break-in period. The heel is padded and shaped well and holds the heel securely and provides good ankle support. The toe cap and high-wear areas for pedaling are reinforced with a light rubbery layer. The toe box reinforcement provides some protection on the trail but is a bit softer than other reinforced options in the test. Similar to a trail running shoe, the sole is heavily rockered through the toe and thicker under the heel than the flatter, thinner soles of other riding shoes. The sole flexes naturally and they walk as well as a regular pair of running shoes with wider tread lugs at the toe and heel that help to enhance grip while scrambling up or down steep trails.</p><p></p><p>The mesh upper is exceptionally airy, dries extremely quickly, and evacuates heat well. It is easily the best-ventilated and most breathable shoe we tested and helps keep the feet cooler and more comfortable on the hottest of days. This comes at the cost of foot protection and also water resistance as water can easily pass through the mesh to the feet. That said, the material doesn’t soak up much moisture (though your socks will get wet) and the shoes dry out very quickly. While the mesh on our test pair is holding up well so far, it does seem a bit less durable and more prone to damage than tougher, thicker materials. </p><p></p><p>But how do they perform on the bike? The Trailcross is a unique shoe that has its place. Pedaling efficiency is similar to the medium flex shoes like the Freerider Pro, Giro Latch, and Fox Union, and Five Ten did a great job making the sole flex directional. They flex easily when walking, yet they avoid folding over the pedals excessively, similar to the aforementioned models. The Stealth Phantom rubber isn’t quite as grippy on the pedals as the Ride Concepts Max Grip or the Stealth S1 on the Freerider Pro but is adequate for casual rides on mellower terrain. The slight reduction in grip can also be attributed in part to the slightly higher stack of the sole, and the slight reduction in support from the uppers. That’s not to say they don’t grip well enough for most trail rides, they just wouldn’t be our first choice for high-speed, aggressive riding.</p><p></p><p>A lot of the time testing the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffive-ten-trailcross-xt-cycling-shoe-mens\">Five Ten Trailcross XT</a> was spent coaching a summer mountain bike camp, and they quickly became a favorite for that application. While they aren’t the shoes we’ll reach for for the most aggressive riding, they are definitely in the rotation for the hottest days, more casual rides, and any time there will be equal time spent on and off the bike. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a

Bikerumor?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Bikerumor, we’ve been obsessing over the latest and greatest products for well over a decade. As a team of die-hard cyclists, we’re always seeking the best gear that can enhance our experience and improve our performance whether that’s bikes, wheels, tires, helmets, or footwear. Whether for personal use or reviews, we’re constantly getting our hands on the latest and greatest mountain bike shoes to put through the wringer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the purposes of this buyer’s guide, we gathered twelve of the best flat pedal shoes available in 2023 to test and compare side by side. We tapped Bikerumor contributor, Paul Clauss, for the majority of the testing which took place near his home in northern Vermont. Paul is an avid mountain biker, mountain bike coach, trail builder, and mechanical engineer. A dedicated flat pedal rider, Paul has been riding in flat pedal shoes for many years and has developed a keen sense for the performance characteristics that make a quality shoe. The punchy technical terrain of Vermont serves as an ideal testing ground with short, sharp climbs and steep, rocky, and rooty descents that will challenge the grip of any outsole compound and tread design. The wildly variable weather of northern New England also provided conditions ranging from cool to extremely hot and humid to dry and historically wet and rainy. During testing, these shoes really saw a little bit of everything. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to testing flat pedal shoes, Paul has also tested the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/\">best flat pedals</a> and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-dropper-post/\">best dropper posts</a> for comprehensive buyer’s guides. If you’re in the market for a new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-helmet/\">mountain bike helmet</a>, we’ve tested those too. And, if you’re a clipless pedal rider, we’ve thoroughly tested and reviewed the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/\">best clipless mountain bike shoes</a> and have recommendations for everything from XC to trail and DH riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Buying Advice: How to Choose Flat Pedal Shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many options on the market, choosing the right pair of flat pedal shoes can seem like a daunting task. With Five Ten dominating the market for a long time, the decision used to be a bit more straightforward, but now there are more choices than ever before to cover the needs of everyone from downhill rippers to trail riders. We suggest considering several variables when searching for flat pedal shoes; your riding style, fit/comfort, grip/traction, sole stiffness, foot protection, weather resistance, and walkability. We discuss each in greater detail below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-riding.jpeg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-riding.jpeg\" alt=\"Five Ten Trailcross TX flat pedal shoes riding shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-riding.jpeg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-riding-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-riding-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-riding-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-riding-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-riding-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-riding-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>It’s important to match your shoes with your riding style or the conditions you encounter, whether that’s steep enduro tracks or trips to the bike park.

There are lots of different models out there designed to meet the demands of different riding styles, so one should be able to find the right shoes for the job. Downhill riders who spend their days riding chairlifts or shuttles to the top of rough, high-speed descents will often seek shoes with more supportive and protective uppers, impact-absorbing materials, and grippy soles that will keep your feet stuck on the pedals through the chatter of rock gardens and braking bumps. Trail and all-mountain riders who spend their days pedaling to the top of their descents will often steer towards a more balanced, versatile shoe that is moderately protective, pedals efficiently, provides adequate grip, and is possibly better ventilated and slightly lighter weight. People who frequent the pump track or dirt jumps tend to prefer slightly softer flexing soles for pedal feedback and often gravitate to moderately grippy soles for better foot mobility for doing tricks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-pumptrack.jpeg\"><img width=\"1311\" height=\"874\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-pumptrack.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized 2FO Method flat pedal shoes at the pump track\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-pumptrack.jpeg 1311w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-pumptrack-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-pumptrack-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-pumptrack-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-pumptrack-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-pumptrack-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Sessioning the neighborhood pump track has different demands than downhill riding. Thankfully, there are shoes for every type of riding.

How a shoe fits is also a personal preference with some people gravitating towards a more snug and precise fit, while others may enjoy a looser and more forgiving approach. Finding the right fit for you is often best achieved by trying shoes on so you can ensure that the length, width, and volume of the shoe are right for your specific foot size and shape. This is particularly important for those with notably narrow or wide feet as most shoes are made to fit average width/volume feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your regular sneaker or hiking boot size can be a good starting point although some riders size down a half size or so to get a more snug fit for foot stability and control reasons. If you already know your flat pedal shoe size, it is usually fairly consistent within the same brand, though it can vary slightly between different brands as their US and EU sizes may not line up exactly the same on their size charts. It is definitely worth referencing the size charts, and trying shoes on whenever possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fit is one of the primary factors that dictates your overall comfort. Too small of a shoe and you can experience hot spots, foot cramps, or scrunched toes. Too loose and your foot may slip around inside the shoe which may result in blisters or a reduction of stability and control. Likewise, different materials, levels of padding, ventilation, and the closure system can play a role in how the shoe conforms to your foot and how comfortable it is over the course of a long ride or season of riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arch support is another consideration as most brands are aiming to create a shoe that works for most people and that typically involves an insole that has an average amount of arch support. Those who have specific arch support needs will often benefit from the use of an aftermarket or custom insole to find the level they need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The intended use of a shoe can also affect comfort. Shoes with stiffer soles prioritize pedaling efficiency and support but may sacrifice off-the-bike comfort and performance as a result. The Specialized 2FO DH Flat, for example, handles the impacts and loads of DH riding well, but isn’t super comfortable to walk in for extended periods – it’s a shoe built for downhill performance. In contrast, the Five Ten Trailcross XT is super comfortable for walking around all day, but the comparatively softer sole and less protective upper may not be the best choice for super rough downhills. Matching your riding style and terrain with a shoe’s intended use is a good recipe that should help enhance comfort based on your needs and preferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-Soles-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-Soles-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Flat Pedal Shoes side by side sole comparison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-Soles-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-Soles-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-Soles-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-Soles-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-Soles-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-Soles-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-Soles-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Flat-Pedal-Shoe-Soles-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>While similar, the outsoles of flat pedal shoes are made of different rubber compounds and have varying tread designs intended to provide grip on the pedals. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Grip and Traction</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For most flat pedal riders, the grip on the pedals is one of the highest priorities, though this varies somewhat depending on riding style, terrain, and personal preferences. While many people want a locked-in, glued-to-the-pedal feel for security, control, and safety, others may enjoy a bit more freedom of movement and foot mobility. The pedal grip provided by a flat pedal shoe depends on the outsole material, tread pattern, height of the lugs, and dampening from the midsole, as well as the flat pedals you use. Most flat pedal shoes rely mainly on using soft, tacky rubber with low-profile lugs to provide a friction-based grip that the pedal pins can settle into, while others may use more of a mechanical connection approach where the pins settle into channels in the sole or against the edges of the tread lugs. The Crankbrothers Stamp Boa, for example, aims to combine friction with mechanical grip by patterning their sole pattern after the footprint of their Stamp pedals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only a few years ago, Five Ten’s Stealth rubber compounds were dominant in the grip department and are the reason their shoes were and continue to be some of the most popular on the market. Five Ten’s Stealth rubber is still a great choice, but thankfully, other companies’ outsoles are catching up and providing competitive levels of grip. These days, Giro’s Tack rubber, Ride Concepts’ Max Grip, and Fox’s Ultratac outsoles provide a very similar level of grip and traction on the pedals to Five Ten’s Stealth S1 while Specialized’s SlipNot ST felt the grippiest when tested side by side. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of pure grip and the feeling of being truly stuck to the pedals, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-2fo-dh-flat-mountain-bike-shoes\">Specialized 2FO DH Flat</a> and its SlipNot ST outsole were just a cut above the rest. Just a hair below, the Fox Ultratrac, Ride Concepts Max Grip, Five Ten Stealth S1, and Giro Tack compounds provide a very balanced feel with super reliable traction and a bit more forgiveness in regard to foot repositioning. Again, the pedals you choose are a major factor in the grip equation as well, and you can check out our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/\">review of the best flat pedals</a> if you’re looking for a new pair. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crankbrothers-stamp-boa-stiffness.jpeg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crankbrothers-stamp-boa-stiffness.jpeg\" alt=\"Crankbrothers stamp boa flat pedal shoe sole stiffness\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crankbrothers-stamp-boa-stiffness.jpeg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crankbrothers-stamp-boa-stiffness-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crankbrothers-stamp-boa-stiffness-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crankbrothers-stamp-boa-stiffness-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crankbrothers-stamp-boa-stiffness-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crankbrothers-stamp-boa-stiffness-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The stiffness of the sole is directly related to how efficiently it pedals, the level of support it provides, and the feel on the pedals. (photo: David Cheskin)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sole Stiffness</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The stiffness of the sole of a flat pedal shoe impacts pedaling efficiency, the support and feel of the shoe when riding, and how the shoe performs when walking. A stiff shoe will be slightly more efficient on long pedal-heavy rides and more supportive on long or rough descents, while a softer shoe will typically provide a more tactile feel on the pedals but less support, which can lead to foot fatigue or soreness over time. Most shoes strike a good balance with some outliers on either end of the sole stiffness spectrum designed to meet more specific needs. Like most other things, this is generally a personal preference based on the type of riding you do and the desired performance characteristics you seek from your shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given their long-standing popularity in the market, the Five Ten Freerider Pro is a bit of a benchmark that many people may already be familiar with. After riding a variety of shoes, we found the Freerider Pro to be about average in terms of sole stiffness with a slight increase on the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgiro-latch-cycling-shoe-mens\">Giro Latch</a>, as well as a significant increase on the Ride Concepts Tallac Boa and Specialized 2FO DH Flat. Despite their higher level of stiffness, all three of those models still have a good pedal feel that avoids feeling too wooden while providing a bit more efficiency and reducing foot fatigue on longer rides or rough descents. Still, the sweet spot for many riders will likely be the moderate stiffness of something like the Freerider Pro, Fox Union, or Ride Concepts Accomplice. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-2FO-DH-protection-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-2FO-DH-protection-scaled.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-2FO-DH-protection-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-2FO-DH-protection-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-2FO-DH-protection-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-2FO-DH-protection-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-2FO-DH-protection-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-2FO-DH-protection-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-2FO-DH-protection-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-2FO-DH-protection-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The DH-oriented Specialized 2FO DH Flat shoes offer more foot protection than most with a heavily reinforced toe box and a raised medial ankle cuff for added protection from crank and frame strikes. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Foot Protection</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of foot protection to look for in a flat pedal shoe depends on what you plan to use them for. Nearly all of the shoes in this buyer’s guide have a reinforced toe box and some degree of heel/ankle padding, with the exception of the more casual Specialized 2FO Method. If you find yourself stubbing your toes frequently while riding, a larger, stronger toe box is a good choice. If you are an aggressive downhill rider, you might look for a more protective option with more padding extending through the entire shoe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the shoes we tested are versatile, all-around models that have moderate foot protection. Shoes like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F113263%2Ffive-ten-freerider-pro-mountain-bike-shoes-mens\">Five-Ten Freerider Pro</a> and Giro Latch look nearly identical and both have synthetic uppers, reinforced toe boxes and heels, and light padding throughout. Both the Fox Union Flat and the Crankbrothers Stamp Boa offer similar levels of reinforcement to the aforementioned models, but their rubbery TPU-coated uppers have a slightly tougher, more durable feel. All four of these shoes offer adequate protection for trail and all-mountain riding, and some people will even use them for more aggressive gravity riding too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most protective shoe we tested in the DH-oriented <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-2fo-dh-flat-mountain-bike-shoes\">Specialized 2FO DH Flat</a>. This burly shoe features a heavily reinforced toe box as well as a raised medial ankle cuff to provide added ankle protection. Not far behind, the Ride Concepts Tallac Boa is another burly shoe that isn’t specifically designed for DH, but should certainly be able to handle it and other aggressive riding scenarios. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the casual-looking Specialized 2FO DH Method is essentially a canvas shoe with a mountain bike sole, and it offers little in the way of protective features. Similarly, the adventure-oriented Five Ten Trailcross XT has a reinforced heel cup and lightly reinforced toe box, but the mesh uppers are otherwise quite thin and less protective than thicker materials. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-hiking.jpeg\"><img width=\"1599\" height=\"1066\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-hiking.jpeg\" alt=\"Five Ten Trailcross GTX flat pedal shoes hiking shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-hiking.jpeg 1599w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-hiking-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-hiking-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-hiking-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-hiking-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-hiking-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-ten-trailcross-gtx-hiking-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Some shoes, like Five Ten’s Trailcross models and Ride Concepts Tallac Boa, are better for walking and hiking than other models. (photo: Blair Kemp)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Walkability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As with the other flat pedal shoe considerations, the walkability of a pair of mountain bike shoes will vary in importance depending on your needs. Many people ride less technical trails that do not require frequent dismounts, while others may face technical rocks gardens, significant hike-a-bike sections, or like to session features regularly. Most shoes are designed with on-the-bike performance as their priority with their walkability as a complete afterthought, though some shoes aim to perform well off the bike too. You can generally tell which shoes are best for walking by looking at them – they look like light hiking/running shoes or hiking boots. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the shoes tested, we found the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffive-ten-trailcross-xt-cycling-shoe-mens\">Five Ten Trailcross XT</a>, Trailcross GTX, and Ride Concepts Tallac Boa the best for hiking, with the softer Trailcross XT better for short distances and the stiffer sole of the Tallac Boa more supportive for more technical terrain. The other shoes were fairly similar for walking with their flat soles, lower profile treads, and relatively traditional flat pedal shoe forms. They all work well enough to walk relatively normally, but you wouldn’t go out of your way to walk around in them for too long. Still, they will all get you out to that viewpoint or back up the trail to try that tricky section again with little to complain about. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Trailcross-breathability-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Trailcross-breathability-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Five Ten Trailcross XT and Ride Concepts Tallac Boa flat pedal shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Trailcross-breathability-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Trailcross-breathability-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Trailcross-breathability-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Trailcross-breathability-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Trailcross-breathability-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Trailcross-breathability-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Trailcross-breathability-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Five-Ten-Trailcross-breathability-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Five Ten Trailcross XT and Ride Concepts Tallac Boa are two of the most breathable shoes we tested. Interestingly, the Cordura uppers of the Tallac also resist water very well, while the mesh uppers of the Trailcross do not. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Breathability and Water Resistance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Flat pedal mountain bike shoes need to handle a wide range of temperatures and conditions from bone dry to rainy and sopping wet. Your needs, however, will depend on where you live and the conditions you experience on the trails. If you live in a very hot climate, you might compromise on the level of padding and water resistance in favor of a thinner, more breathable upper to let airflow into the shoe. If you are constantly riding in the rain, you might prefer a less porous upper with water-resistant materials to keep water out, often at the expense of breathability. Most modern shoes handle conditions from dry to light rain just fine, and there are wet weather-specific shoes, like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F195394%2Ffive-ten-trailcross-gtx-mountain-bike-shoes-mens\">Five Ten Trailcross GTX</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F226538%2Fshimano-gf8-gore-tex-mountain-bike-shoes-mens%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">Shimano GF800 GTX</a> with a Gore-Tex membrane, on the market for those who live and ride in the worst of conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the shoes tested for this buyer’s guide do fairly well across all environmental conditions, but each has its strengths and weaknesses. All-rounders like the Giro Latch or Five Ten Freerider Pro, using microfiber/synthetic uppers, stay reasonably cool and dry but are not ideal for the hottest or wettest rides. The rubbery uppers on the Fox Union and Crankbrothers Stamp Boa or the leather/textile Specialized 2FO DH Flat resist water surprisingly effectively, but trap a little more heat inside the shoe. The Five Ten Trailcross XT’s mesh upper lets air and water right in but dries very quickly. The Cordura upper of the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fride-concepts-tallac-boa-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Ride Concepts Tallac Boa</a> proved to be a surprise favorite in this regard, balancing a high degree of water resistance while also having a well-ventilated feel. The Five Ten Trailcross GTX is a clear standout for wet conditions with its waterproof Gore-Tex membrane, though it’s designed for use in cool, wet weather, and can be a bit stifling on the feet in warmer conditions</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-waterproof-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-waterproof-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Gore-Tex lined Shimano GF800 GTX flat pedal shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-waterproof-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-waterproof-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-waterproof-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-waterproof-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-waterproof-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-waterproof-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-waterproof-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shimano-GF800-GTX-waterproof-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>For properly wet and cold conditions, a shoe like the Gore-Tex lined Shimano GF800 GTX is your best bet for keeping your feet dry and warm. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Closures</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of flat pedal shoes use traditional shoe laces as the closure system. This is in contrast to the clipless shoe market where there is a wider range of closure systems. Lately, however, flat pedal shoe brands have been adopting other methods for tightening your flat pedal shoes including Boa dials. Some brands and models of shoes are even offered in multiple versions, like the Ride Concepts <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fride-concepts-tallac-boa-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\">Tallac that comes with Boa</a> ($190) or laces ($160), and the Crankbrothers <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearcyclingflatpedalshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcrank-brothers-stamp-boa-cycling-shoe-mens\">Stamp that comes in Boa</a> ($180), Speed Lace ($150), and Lace ($130) versions to suit varying preferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laces certainly work well for the flat pedal shoe application as they pull tension evenly over the mid-foot and they are cheap and easy to replace if they become damaged. The downsides are that they are a little slower to put on and take off, it takes a little longer to adjust tension while riding, and they can be messy to deal with in sloppy conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boa dials, often used in combination with velcro straps, are becoming more common on high-end flat pedal shoes. Boa systems use a ratcheting dial to add or remove tension from thin wires/laces over the foot. Boa systems make it very quick and easy to put shoes on and take them off, and to adjust tension while riding. The downsides are that they typically add to the price of shoes, they can sometimes be damaged, and have a somewhat checkered history in terms of reliability. The good news is that Boa systems are becoming more reliable and they are often covered by warranty if they break or are damaged. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fla-Pedal-Shoes-closures-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fla-Pedal-Shoes-closures-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Different closure systems on flat pedal shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fla-Pedal-Shoes-closures-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fla-Pedal-Shoes-closures-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fla-Pedal-Shoes-closures-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fla-Pedal-Shoes-closures-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fla-Pedal-Shoes-closures-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fla-Pedal-Shoes-closures-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fla-Pedal-Shoes-closures-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fla-Pedal-Shoes-closures-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Laces still dominate the flat pedal shoe market, but other systems like Boa dials are becoming more common.

Flat pedal specific mountain bike shoes are optimized for traction, support, safety, and to handle the environmental conditions you’ll encounter on the trail. While preferences and opinions vary, we feel that the performance benefits, particularly pedal grip, support, vibration absorption, and foot protection, make using flat pedal mountain bike shoes the best choice. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Do my pedals matter?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Yes! Flat pedals vary in terms of platform size, pin layout, etc, and they provide varying levels of support and grip. Generally speaking, most good pedals will work well with most good shoes, but you’ll also need to consider your riding style and needs/wants from a pedal as they do perform differently. During testing, we used most of the shoes with the Nukeproof Horizon Pro Sam Hill Enduro pedal for consistency, with the Chromag Dagga and Raceface Atlas sprinkled in. If you’re searching for new flat pedals to complement your new shoes, we have recommendations in our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/\">flat pedal buyer’s guide</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sole patterns on most shoes in this test are optimized to work with a wide variety of pedals, with the exception of the Crankbrothers Stamp Boa, which is designed specifically to work with their Stamp pedal line. This is done by matching the tread pattern to the silhouette and pins of the pedals. The Stamp shoes work well enough with most pedals, but we found they actually work slightly better on the Stamp pedals as the pins fit into the grooves in the sole tread.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Platform size is also a consideration, as some come in different sizes that are optimized to work with different size feet. Riders with smaller feet may opt for pedals with smaller platforms to better match the sole of their shoes, while those with larger feet will typically gravitate towards larger platforms for added stability. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What size flat pedal shoe should I get?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>The sizing of a shoe is very unique to the shape and size of your foot and proper fit is very important. Too small of a shoe and you may end up with pinched toes, cramping, and discomfort, too loose and your foot may end up slipping around inside the shoe which can cause blisters and result in a reduction of control. Fit preferences vary, of course, but most people generally can start at or near their everyday shoe size and go from there. Given that our shoes are a contact point for control of our mountain bikes, however, many people will opt for a snug fit that is achieved by sizing down slightly from their regular street shoe size. And, of course, sizing is not perfectly consistent across different brands, so it is generally best to try shoes on before you buy to ensure they fit you correctly. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How long can I expect my flat pedal shoes to last?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>The lifespan of a pair of mountain bike shoes is directly related to how much you ride and the level of abuse you put them through. People who ride almost every day all season long may only get a season of use out of a pair of shoes, while those who ride less frequently or more casually should expect to get a couple seasons or more from a quality pair. Typically, the soft rubber of the soles is one of the first places to show wear as the pedal pins leave marks, grooves, and scars in the rubber. Similarly, the uppers of shoes may be prone to damage if scraped on rocks, logs, and shrubbery, and may break down slightly more quickly when used in wet conditions frequently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the duration of our test period, we can’t comment definitively on the long-term durability of any of the shoes we tested. After a couple months of riding, they all showed minimal wear and we expect most models in this test to be reasonably durable given their intended use. The beefier models like the Ride Concepts Tallac Boa and Specialized 2FO DH Flat seem the most rugged and capable of handling the most abuse, while models like the Five Ten Trailcross LT and Specialized Method could be prone to wearing out faster given the lighter materials used in their uppers.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"1580\" height=\"1053\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Flat-Pedals-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Best Mountain Bike Flat Pedals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Flat-Pedals-1.jpeg 1580w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Flat-Pedals-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Flat-Pedals-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Flat-Pedals-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Flat-Pedals-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Flat-Pedals-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Flat-Pedals-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Mountain Bike Flat Pedals of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The best mountain bike shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Mountain Bike Shoes of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-flat-pedal-shoes/\">The Best Flat Pedal Mountain Bike Shoes of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Paul Clauss","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0cc97a8d6589e613f908b461777511eab652f32a3399986df620e98a988d040d","category":"Cycling"}
