With up to 240mm of drop, adjustable travel (in 5mm increments), and a dedicated 34.9mm diameter option, Transfer shot itself to the top of our list to check out in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Check out some <strong>Quick Hits</strong> on what’s new:</p>\n<p>There was a 62% reduction in air loss over the prior model Transfer after fully redesigning internals with an entirely new sealing system. With a focus on enhanced durability, this updated design replaced two dynamic air shaft seals with static seals, lowering overall friction and, therefore, lowering air loss potential.</p>\n<p>A 6x increase in duty cycle life came from doubling the oil sealing and adding a wiper. Less oil loss means less maintenance, longer life, and reduced overall air loss from air dissolved in the oil.</p>\n<p>The air chamber is now at the top of the post, which eliminated dynamic air seals and allowed us to add a Schrader valve for riders wanting to adjust air pressure. Our Schrader valves come with O-ringed metal caps that are proven to not leak.</p>\n<p>A two-bolt low-stack head.</p>\n<p>MY25 <span>Transfer</span> Post Aftermarket Pricing | Factory Series / Performance Series Elite: $339 / $289 USD | $449 / $389 CAD | 449 / 369 EURO</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diameter Sizes (mm)</li>\n<li>30.9 / 31.6 / 34.9</li>\n<li>Metric Sizes (Drop)</li>\n<li>95-120mm / 125-150mm / 155-180mm / 185-210mm / 215-240mm</li>\n<li>Routing</li>\n<li>Internal Only</li>\n<li>Lower Coating</li>\n<li>Anodized Black</li>\n<li>Upper Coating</li>\n<li>Kashima Coat (Factory), Anodized Black (Performance Elite)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://shop.ridefox.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fox</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-new-fox-transfer-dropper-post-gets-a-refresh/\">The Fox Transfer Dropper Post Gets a Refresh</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"f690338bb484438ac77caa13c83cbc04c636ec95a9f99f2777fe63dcd0e3068e","category":"Cycling"}
