The original 3D Violet was first introduced back in 1988, and after a wild success, 3D Violet became the catalyst for Chris King to launch their colored anodizing program which has become a big part of the company’s attention-grabbing identity. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chris-King-3D-Violet-hubs-logo.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chris-King-3D-Violet-hubs-logo-800x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Chris King 3D Violet hubs logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chris-King-3D-Violet-hubs-logo-800x500.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chris-King-3D-Violet-hubs-logo-297x186.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chris-King-3D-Violet-hubs-logo-120x75.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chris-King-3D-Violet-hubs-logo-768x480.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chris-King-3D-Violet-hubs-logo.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Over the years, we’ve produced a variety of eye-catching colors,” </em>Says Chris King Design manager, Jay Sycip. “<em>Having introduced several matte finishes recently, we decided it was the perfect time to bring back a classic, highly requested color, and 3D Violet was the standout choice.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chris-King-3D-Violet-hub-spoke-holes.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chris-King-3D-Violet-hub-spoke-holes-800x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Chris King 3D Violet hub spoke holes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chris-King-3D-Violet-hub-spoke-holes-800x500.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chris-King-3D-Violet-hub-spoke-holes-297x186.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chris-King-3D-Violet-hub-spoke-holes-120x75.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chris-King-3D-Violet-hub-spoke-holes-768x480.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chris-King-3D-Violet-hub-spoke-holes.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for an up close and personal visit of this iconic Chris King color with our in-depth coverage of this year’s Sea Otter Classic!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://chrisking.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ChrisKing.com </a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/chris-king-3d-violet-purple-hubs-headset/\">35 years later, Chris King’s Iconic 3D Violet is Back &amp; Blingy as Ever</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d3834ca6ef7570767e2918cb207a9d2e09387dc0dabacfc693deb022c959cd5a","category":"Cycling"}
