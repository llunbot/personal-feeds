It’ll be at our two remaining Track Days events in London and Leeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale’s endurance pioneer, the Synapse is always quoted as the bike you should be riding, and the latest version sees its SmartSense lights and rearview radar get integrated, there’s also a new down tube storage hatch, increased tyre clearance and aerodynamic features borrowed from the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-track-days-2025-bikes-cannondale-supersix-evo\">SuperSix Evo</a> – which you can also ride at Track Days. The new Synapse comes in five specs, with prices starting at £2,995 and going all the way up to £13,000 for the new Lab71 model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get the full details of the new Cannondale Synapse <a
