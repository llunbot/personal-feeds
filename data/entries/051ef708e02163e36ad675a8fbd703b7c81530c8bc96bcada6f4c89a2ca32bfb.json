Unsure of how Air Canada's bereavement rates worked, Moffatt asked Air Canada's chatbot to explain.</p>\n<p>The chatbot provided inaccurate information, encouraging Moffatt to book a flight immediately and then request a refund within 90 days. In reality, Air Canada's policy explicitly stated that the airline will not provide refunds for bereavement travel after the flight is booked. Moffatt dutifully attempted to follow the chatbot's advice and request a refund but was shocked that the request was rejected.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003992#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003992&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"051ef708e02163e36ad675a8fbd703b7c81530c8bc96bcada6f4c89a2ca32bfb","category":"Tech"}
