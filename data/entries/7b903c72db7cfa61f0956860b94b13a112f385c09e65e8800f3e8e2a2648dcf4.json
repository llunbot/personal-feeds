For example, Apple's use of recycled materials for printed circuit boards was spearheaded by an exclusively recycled supply chain for gold in the plating of the main logic board for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>. Since then, it has increased the use of circuitry made with recycled materials in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, Apple Watch, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, MacBook Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>. In 2022, a quarter of all cobalt found in Apple products came from recycled material, up from 13 percent in 2021, paving the way for the transition to 100 percent recycled cobalt by 2025. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2022, around 20 percent of all material shipped in Apple devices came from renewable or recycled sources. The company said that the change brings it closer to the aim of eventually making all products using only recycled and renewable materials and advances its goal to make every product carbon neutral by 2030.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/apple-ar-device-disassembly.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nApple also flagged that its Material Recovery Lab in Austin, Texas have started using AR video projected directly onto work surfaces to show recycling partners how to disassemble devices. In addition, the company said that by 2025 it will completely eliminate plastics from its packaging. Following the adoption of fibre alternatives to screen films, wraps, and foam, 96 percent of Apple packaging is plastic-free. The company says it is now working to replace the labels, lamination, varnish, and other \"small uses\" that make up the remaining 4 percent.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-environment/\">Apple Environment</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/environment/\">Environment</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/13/apple-to-accelerate-use-of-recycled-materials/\">Apple Announces Plans to Accelerate Use of Recycled Materials in New Products</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-plans-to-accelerate-use-of-recycled-materials-in-new-products.2386713/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7b903c72db7cfa61f0956860b94b13a112f385c09e65e8800f3e8e2a2648dcf4","category":"Apple"}
