{"title":"★ France Fines Apple $162M for App Tracking Transparency, Taking the Side of Surveillance Advertisers Over Users","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/france_merde_decision_app_tracking_transparency","date":1743450391000,"content":"\n<p>Jon Brodkin, reporting for Ars Technica, “<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/france-fines-apple-e150m-for-excessive-pop-ups-that-let-users-reject-tracking/\">France Fines Apple €150M for “Excessive” Pop-Ups That Let Users Reject Tracking</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>France’s competition regulator fined Apple €150 million, saying\nthe iPhone maker went overboard in its implementation of pop-up\nmessages that let users consent to or reject tracking that\nthird-party applications use for targeted advertising.</p>\n\n<p>The App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework used by Apple on\niPhones and iPads since 2021 makes the use of third-party\napplications too complex and hurts small companies that rely on\nadvertising revenue, said a <a href=\"https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/targeted-advertising-autorite-de-la-concurrence-imposes-fine-eu150000000-apple\">press release</a> today by the\nAutorité de la concurrence (Competition Authority). The system\nharms “smaller publishers in particular since, unlike the main\nvertically integrated platforms, they depend to a large extent on\nthird-party data collection to finance their business,” the\nagency said.</p>\n\n<p>User consent obtained via the ATT framework “authorizes the\napplication in question to collect user data for targeted\nadvertising purposes,” the agency said. “If consent is given, the\napplication can access the Identifier for Advertisers (‘IDFA’),\nthe identifier by which each device can be tracked through its use\nof third-party applications and sites.” The French investigation\nwas triggered by a complaint lodged by advertising industry\nassociations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ben Lovejoy, <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/31/apple-bizarrely-fined-162m-for-app-tracking-transparency-after-advertisers-complained/\">correctly calling the decision “bizarre” at 9to5Mac</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Complaints were made <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/11/apple-app-tracking/\">in a number of countries</a> — some\narguing that it was unfair because <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/06/14/app-tracking-transparency-antitrust/\">Apple exempts its own\napps</a> (which are in reality subject to even tighter\ncontrols), others saying the loss of revenue <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/13/app-tracking-transparency-increases-in-app-purchase-prices/\">forced developers to\nraise prices</a> to compensate. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Although expected, the decision is still inexplicable. ATT\ninvolves precisely <em>one</em> popup asking a simple yes/no question.\nAdditionally, Apple lets users switch on a toggle (shown above) to\nblock apps from even asking the question. It’s especially odd\ngiven that ATT is a privacy feature, and Europe has the strongest\nprivacy laws in the world. The EU <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/03/ad-tracking-rules/\">has also previously\nvindicated</a> Apple’s introduction of ATT.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s not inexplicable or odd if you view the decision as coming from a perspective where government bureaucracy is viewed as an inherent good, and well-intentioned process is all that matters, not actual results. Read the <em>Autorité de la Concurrence</em>’s decision (<a href=\"https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/targeted-advertising-autorite-de-la-concurrence-imposes-fine-eu150000000-apple\">which they helpfully do make available in English</a>) and it’s pretty clear:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The <em>Autorité</em> found that the ATT framework imposed by Apple is\nnot necessary, insofar as the consent obtained is not valid under\nthe applicable laws, in particular the French Data Protection Act.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, the fact that publishers that so wish cannot rely on\nthe ATT framework to comply with their legal obligations means\nthat they must continue to use their own consent collection\nsolutions, known as consent management platforms (“CMPs”). The\nresult is that multiple consent pop-ups are displayed, making the\nuse of third-party applications in the iOS environment excessively\ncomplex, as observed by the French data protection authority\n(<em>Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés</em> — CNIL)\nin a 2022 opinion issued at the request of the <em>Autorité</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s ostensibly “not necessary” because French and EU privacy laws are supposedly enough, and all that’s needed. And it’s unfair because now, under ATT, third-party surveillance advertisers who seek to track users across apps on iOS need to ask permission twice — first through the clear-as-a-bell “Ask App Not to Track” / “Allow Tracking” prompt required by Apple, and again through the byzantine but ultimately toothless permission requirements of France and the EU. ATT has had measurable effects because users understand it, and they prefer not to be tracked. EU and French privacy laws are largely ineffective because, in practice, they <a href=\"https://hep.physics.illinois.edu/home/g-gollin/1984_commercial_dialogue.html\">bury users with confusion</a>. The bureaucratic hurdles they impose are to the benefit, not detriment, of the surveillance ad industry. That’s now proven out by industry groups — the ones ATT successfully tempered — successfully getting France’s regulators to penalize Apple. <em>Users</em> don’t know how to lobby government bureaucracies. What the <em>Autorité de la Concurrence</em> is saying, in so many words, is that two layers of consent is too much, and the only one that’s necessary is the one that advertising lobbying groups <em>don’t object to</em>, not the one they do (but which users understand and like).</p>\n\n<p>It’s clear that only one of these two things — Apple’s ATT or French/EU privacy regulations — was actually effective at reducing tracking: ATT. No one claimed that French or EU privacy laws resulted in Meta losing a fortune because they had to adjust their kleptomaniacal thievery of users’ privacy. But by all accounts, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2022/02/10/apple-meta-and-the-ten-billion-dollar-impact-of-privacy-changes/\">including Meta’s own</a>, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2022/04/23/apple-just-issued-stunning-12-billion-blow-to-facebook/\">ATT cost Meta billions</a>. And yes, ATT hurt small businesses too — small businesses that were built upon surreptitious tracking that users had neither awareness of nor control over. It’s like a consortium of sketchy pawn shops complaining to the authorities after a popular retailer successfully cracked down on an organized shoplifting/pickpocketing ring, and the authorities then fining the retailer for the damage to the pawnbrokers’ business fencing stolen goods — and for exposing the police as ineffective.</p>\n\n<p>App Tracking Transparency actually accomplished, in practice, via user-focused plain-language consent, what the EU’s privacy laws were intended to do but do not. This fine boils down to France declaring that Apple shouldn’t have actually done what the EU was pretending to do. They’re acting at the behest of the very developers and advertising companies who were (and still are) trying to conduct cross-app tracking that App Tracking Transparency successfully gave <em>users</em> some control over.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8b7e68cc46b2cf278c30a5e5a127620ea07c8b0aeddc0a2145a701e6b26a3a61","category":"Tech"}
