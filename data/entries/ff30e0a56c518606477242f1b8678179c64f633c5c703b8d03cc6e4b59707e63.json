It's targeting the hotly contested SUV segment with the new Wagoneer S, which goes on sale this fall. But other than its name, it shares little with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/2022-wagoneer-rocks-a-high-end-vast-interior-while-guzzling-hydrocarbons/\">the gasoline-powered Wagoneer</a>; the Wagoneer S uses the same EV architecture—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/plug-in-jeeps-and-an-ev-ram-1500-pickup-are-part-of-stellantis-new-plan/\">called STLA Large</a>—as the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/dodge-debuts-the-2024-electric-charger-daytona-with-670-horsepower/\">forthcoming electric Dodge Charger</a>.</p>\n<p>It looks like Jeep is using a similar playbook to Dodge and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/ram-goes-for-an-oversized-battery-to-give-ev-truck-500-miles-of-range/\">Ram</a> as it introduces its electric models: Give them the same name and styling as a familiar bestseller to keep customers comfortable, then give them serious power output and some headline-grabbing numbers to generate a halo effect.</p>\n<h2>Powerful</h2>\n<p>That's why the Jeep Wagoneer S Launch Edition will offer 600 hp (447 kW), 617 lb-ft (837 Nm), and a 0–60 mph (0-98 km/h) time of 3.4 seconds. It's powered by a 100.5 kWh battery pack with nickel manganese cobalt chemistry operating at 400 V.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027967#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027967&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
