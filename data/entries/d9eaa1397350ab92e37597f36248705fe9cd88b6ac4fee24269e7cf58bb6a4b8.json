Falling in March, it has the nickname of <em>La Primavera</em> – The Spring Classic – with this year’s races held on Saturday 22nd March 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key word there is ‘races’. The women’s Milan-San Remo makes a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/milan-san-remo-women\">long-awaited return to the calendar</a> having last been held in 2005. The men’s Milan-San Remo is one of the oldest on the calendar – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/oldest-cycling-races\">first held in 1907</a> – and with a total route distance (including neutral zone) of almost 300km, it’s also the longest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the real selling point of Milan-San Remo is its sheer unpredictability. The race’s length, combined with some spitefully placed climbs right at the end of the route and the constant risk of inclement weather, opens up the possibilities for a lot of riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Big breakaways, small breakaways, bunch sprints and brave solo attacks can all win on the day, with everyone from the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/men-sprinters-2025\">burliest of sprinters</a> to the slightest of climbers in with a chance of riding to glory on the Ligurian coast. The 2024 edition was won by Jasper Philipsen in a of small bunch sprint ahead of Michael Matthews and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-interview\">Tadej Pogačar</a>. This is a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/missing-wins\">notable omission from Pogačar’s palmarès</a>, and one he focusses heavily on each year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Milan-San Remo 2025 key information</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/GettyImages-2082108053-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/GettyImages-2082108053-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/GettyImages-2082108053-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/GettyImages-2082108053-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/GettyImages-2082108053-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/GettyImages-2082108053-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/GettyImages-2082108053-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/GettyImages-2082108053-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/GettyImages-2082108053-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/GettyImages-2082108053-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/GettyImages-2082108053.jpg 1890w\" /><figcaption>Marco Bertorello/AFP via Getty</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday 22nd March 2025</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Start</strong>: Women’s – Genova, Italy; Men’s – Pavia, Italy</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Finish</strong>: San Remo, Italy</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Distance</strong>: Women’s – 156km; Men’s – 289km</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>UK live television coverage</strong>: TNT Sports</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2024 winner</strong>: Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+4\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Milan-San Remo 2025 routes</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Women’s route</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"803\" height=\"474\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-111608-e1742296618132.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-111608-e1742296618132.webp 803w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-111608-e1742296618132-300x177.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-111608-e1742296618132-768x453.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-111608-e1742296618132-750x443.webp 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The women’s Milan-San Remo make its return traversing the coastline for almost its entirety, joining the same route as the men’s race from Voltri for the final 138km. The key climbs begin in the last third of the race, with the Tre Capi (Capo Mele, Capo Cervo and Capo Berta) hitting first. Up next is the Cipressa before the final potential launchpad in the Poggio should riders wish to avoid a bunch sprint on the Via Roma.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Men’s route</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"937\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-114642.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-114642.webp 937w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-114642-300x157.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-114642-768x401.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Screenshot-2025-03-18-114642-750x391.webp 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming a good 138km into the day, the Passo del Turchino is a more gradual climb halfway through the race. From there, riders stick to the coastline all the way to San-Remo as per usual. The Tre Capi are barely noticeable on the profile, however their arrival signifies that it’s time for the teams to start pressing on in earnest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already wound up to near warp-speed by this point, the end game really kicks off with the 5.6km long Cipressa. With an average gradient of 4.1%, it comes after 266km and with gradients touching 9%, it’s a bona fide climbing test that has often foiled the plans of sprinters hoping to cling on for a bunch finish and is annually touted as Pogačar’s first springboard.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"639\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Cipressa-2024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Cipressa-2024.jpeg 639w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Cipressa-2024-225x300.jpeg 225w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Most of the time it serves mainly as an opportunity to potentially get rid of some of your rivals rather than win the race outright, but it’s not impossible to launch a successful attack here either. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vincenzo-nibali-cyclist\">Vincenzo Nibali</a> made good ground on the bunch by attacking on the Cipressa in 2014, as did <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/marco-pantani-the-birth-of-il-pirata\">Marco Pantani</a> in 1999. Still, to make anything stick has proven notoriously difficult, and the reason for that is the flat section that lies between it and the approaching Poggio.<span> </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, the iconic Poggio di San Remo is the day’s decisive climb. If a rider or group is going to make a break from the pack, it’s more than likely to come on the upper slopes.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"586\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Poggio-2024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Poggio-2024.jpeg 586w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Poggio-2024-206x300.jpeg 206w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Coming a mere 8km from the finish, positioning here is vital, something that guarantees the peloton will hit it at almost sprint pace. This ascent is only 3.7km and its ramps are not particularly severe, but the speed at which it is taken, added to the fatigue induced from the Cipressa – not to mention the 280km the riders have ridden by this point – is excruciating and means that groups coming over the top are often in a bedraggled state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re then instantly thrown into a highly technical descent, which has also proven a launchpad for decisive attacks in the past, including Mohorič’s win in 2022 and Van der Poel’s solo escapade the year after. Yet when it levels out again in the middle of San Remo, the roads are straight enough that any escaped rider will find themselves well within sight of the bunch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final bend comes with 750m to go. Swinging right onto the Via Roma finishing straight, it’s rare even for breakaway riders to get time to take their hands off the bars.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

certified favourite because of the unpredictability of the final. In the women’s race, the <em>parcours </em>is suited to Lotte Kopecky, but if it comes to a group sprint and her SD Worx teammate Lorena Wiebes is there then their priority probably switches. However given its lengthy absence from the calendar, the women’s race is arguably even more unpredictable than the men’s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, it’s almost guaranteed that Tadej Pogačar will be the one to light the spark, almost certainly drawing out Mathieu van der Poel, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tom-pidcock-profile\">Tom Pidcock</a>, Filippo Ganna and Mads Pedersen leaving <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/men-sprinters-2025\" target=\"_blank\">the sprinters</a> to chase back on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it does end up in a bunch sprint, expect it to be Wiebes vs Elisa Balsamo vs Marianne Vos in the women’s race and Jasper Philipsen vs Jonathan Milan vs Michael Matthews in the men’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist</em>‘s ratings: Women’s race</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>★★★★★: Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime), Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★★★★: Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike), Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck), Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★★★: Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ), Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM-Zondacrypto), Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★★: Pauline Ferrand-Prévot (Visma-Lease a Bike), Kristen Faulkner (EF Education-Oatly), Cat Ferguson (Movistar)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★: Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal), Pfeiffer Georgi (Picnic-PostNL), Liane Lippert (Movistar), Cédrine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist</em>‘s ratings: Men’s race</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>★★★★★: Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★★★★: Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates XRG), Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers), Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek), Michael Matthews (Jayco-AlUla)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★★★: Tom Pidcock (Q36.5 Pro Cycling), Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★★: Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease a Bike), Biniam Girmay (Intermarché-Wanty)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★: Laurence Pithie (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Matej Mohoric (Bahrain Victorious), Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Milan-San Remo 2025 how to watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the UK, fans can only watch Milan-San Remo on TNT Sports via Discovery+, in Australia it’ll be on SBS.

Where the Tour organisers introduced the sprinter’s jersey to reestablish some excitement, the organisers of Milan-San Remo also made some changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The route’s only climb had traditionally been the Turchino pass, a longer climb that came at about half distance as an opportunity for the stronger riders to distance themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in time they began to come over the Turchino together, and so the Poggio was introduced in 1960. The fact that Tom Simpson won the race in 1965 suggests diversity, but the desired effect was effectively neutralised by the emergence of one Eddy Merckx, who won Milan-San Remo on seven occasions between 1966 and 1976, the first coming when he was just 20 years old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That record of most wins has remained to date, as has the perpetuation of Milan-San Remo being classified a sprinter’s race, despite increasingly more climbs being added, such as the Cipressa in 1982 or the Turchino-esque La Manie in 2008.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another, Pompeiana, was destined to be included as a vicious penultimate climb in the 2014 edition, but landslides causing roadblocks and then dismissals from certain riders – Mark Cavendish being one of them – claiming the parcours had been updated beyond their capabilities, meant that it never materialised.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123115/d4b_4363-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It must therefore not be forgotten that Milan-San Remo has never been a straightforward gallop. Despite common sprinter names such as Merckx, Kelly, Zabel, Friere, or more obviously Cipollini and Cavendish, proliferating on the list of winners, the efforts they will have had to put in in order to get over the preceding climbs – not to mention the distance at such an early stage of the season – is often forgotten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that Marcel Kittel never even started it, or that names we don’t associate with sprinting, such as Gerrans, Cancellara, Fignon or Chiappucci, pepper the alumni of winners are only further reminders of its nature. Yes, Milan-San Remo is a ‘sprinter’s classic’, but that certainly doesn’t mean it’s always won by one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Milan-San Remo: The Epics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We take a look at some of the most memorable editions, moments and riders that have played a part in the race’s history.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1910 – Riders on the storm</h4>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123120/ofs_eugene_christophe_1921_-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"ofs_eugene_christophe_1921_\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The fourth edition of Milan-San Remo after its inauguration in 1907 is generally regarded as having been held in some of the worst weather conditions that bicycle racers have come up against. The eventual winner, Eugene Christophe, is also famous for being the first person to wear the yellow jersey at the Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the riders lined up on the Milanese start line at 6am, heavy snow was reported to be falling on the Turchino Pass – a stalwart of the parcours, coming as a mid-distance test for the riders – which caused many to abandon before the race had even begun. Once out on the road, the riders were soon isolated and riding by themselves amid the harsh conditions, and by the time they reached the Turchino there were only half of them left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Belgian Cyrille Van Hauwaert was first over the top, 10 minutes ahead of the next rider, but took shelter in a roadside cottage and refused to continue. Christophe himself stopped too, but resumed after eating and finding some trousers to wear, and eventually made his way to front of the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he eventually arrived in San Remo he didn’t even realise he had won after mistakenly thinking he had taken a wrong turn. He was taken to hospital with frostbite, and wasn’t released for a further month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second place Luigi Ganna arrived almost 40 minutes after Christophe, but was disqualified for having taken a lift in a car, and only five riders out of 63 starters made it to the finish. Those, as they say, were the days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2013 – Please take the replacement bus service…</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"644\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/04042019/ofs_milan-sanremo_2013_21-970x644.jpg\" alt=\"ofs_milan-sanremo_2013_21\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While Eugene Christophe and the like raced in an era when bicycle races were feats of endurance that bordered on the militaristic, today’s racers, while probably carrying similar DNA, are of an era of professionalised, commercialised sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that winning a race no longer results in having to spend a month in hospital, but the weather can still have an impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The year that Gerald Ciolek won was a modern-era hark back to the days of raw physical suffering though, with reports of riders crying and shivering uncontrollably as they rode through the sleet and snow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So bad were the conditions that the race was shortened from 298km to 246km, and the two highest climbs – the Turchino and La Manie – were bypassed, with the riders climbing into their team buses and driven to the coast in a mid-race transfer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ian Stannard and Sylvain Chavanel led a dwindling bunch over the Poggio (the final climb of the race), and formed a six-man group that also included Fabian Cancellara and Peter Sagan, which Ciolek, in a sprint that was painful just watching, eventually won out of.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The nail-biters</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>1992 – Demon descending</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/milan_san_remo_kelly_920321-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Being the best part of 300km long, and with a series of testing climbs peppered throughout the parcours, Milan-San Remo is clearly a race that requires a decent amount of physical endeavour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the nature of the course allows for a long list of potential winners, and an annual display of tactical complexity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such example was when Sean Kelly pipped Moreno Argentin in ’92: The Italian was a hot favourite after notching up three consecutive wins in Tirreno-Adriatico, and after powering away on the Poggio he indeed appeared to have an insurmountable gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Kelly, in the twilight of his career and having struggled on the climb, eschewed expectation and attacked on the descent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking advantage of Argentin’s weak descending skills, the Irishman eventually bridged across and unashamedly refused to work, before putting Argentin to the sword in the sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1999 – By a Tchmillimeter</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The ’99 edition of Milan-San Remo pitted a typically broad array of favourites together, from the pure sprint speed of Erik Zabel and all-round capabilities of Michele Bartoli to the climbing prowess of Marco Pantani.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter two had forged ahead before commencing the Poggio, but a lack of cohesion meant that everything came back together on the run-in, for what was then taken to be a guaranteed Erik Zabel win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with less than a kilometre to go, the Russian/Belgian (and now officially Moldovan) Andrei Tchmil took a flyer. Already a victor at Paris-Roubaix and Paris-Tours, but not necessarily on the radar for Milan-San Remo, Tchmil’s deftly timed attack proved to be the winning move, leaving the galloping bunch, led by Zabel, to fight for second.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The to-the-liners</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>2004 – Zabel surprised</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/02123138/sprint_finish_02_040320_ofs-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with celebrating a lap early, it’s probably one of the most embarrassing and frustrating things that could happen to a professional cyclist. But in the 2004 edition of Milan-San Remo, German sprinter Erik Zabel had a <em>‘bit of a mare’</em> and raised his arms to celebrate, only to watch Oscar Friere squeeze underneath him and take the win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be the first of three Milan-San Remo victories for the Spaniard, in a race that suited his tactical nous and physical strengths perfectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2009 – Cav pips Haussler</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/02/ofs_milan-sanremo_08_2009-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In perhaps one of the most tantalising climaxes to a race possible, Mark Cavendish took the biggest win of his young career with a truly remarkable sprint in the 2009 edition of the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australian Heinrich Haussler, who would go on to enjoy his most successful season as a pro to date, had launched a surprise early sprint/late attack with 250m to go, gaining what appeared to be an insurmountable gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Cavendish, who was about to come into the prime years of his road sprinting career, used the last 100m to kick, and kick again, pulling himself up to Haussler, and then past him within millimeters of the line. It was enough to make you – and him – weep.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/milan-san-remo-preview\">Milan-San Remo 2025 preview: Routes, favourites, how to watch and start lists</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Jcunningham","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d9eaa1397350ab92e37597f36248705fe9cd88b6ac4fee24269e7cf58bb6a4b8","category":"Cycling"}
