{"title":"Report: The 15-inch MacBook Air isn’t the only new laptop launching at WWDC","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/1787602/new-macbook-air-pro-15-inch-wwdc-2023.html","date":1681732239000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>With less than two months two go until <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC</a>, the rumors keep pouring in. After <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1785378/ios-17-leak-app-settings-interface-details.html\">hearing about iOS 17</a> last week, we now have some details on the hardware Apple plans to bring to the big show, and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">anticipated AR headset</a> might have some supporting acts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Mark Gurman’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-04-16/apple-wwdc-2023-june-5-plan-reality-headset-new-macs-watchos-10-ios-17-lgjfj5bf&amp;xcust=1-1-1787602-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">latest Power On newsletter</a>, Apple has several new MacBooks in the pipeline, “at least some” of which will be announced during the June 5 WWDC keynote. Gurman doesn’t share much in the way of specifics, other than to state the somewhat obvious point that the new June laptops “probably won’t boast major new M3 chips. Instead, they’ll run something in line with the current M2 processors.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That likely means the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819516/15-inch-macbook-air-release-date-specs-rumors.html\">15-inch MacBook Air</a>, which has been rumored for months and is reportedly already in production, is on the way. It will be Apple’s first 15-inch laptop since 2019, when the 15-inch MacBook Pro was discontinued and replaced with the 16-inch model. The new Air will reportedly have an M2 processor, possibly with an M2 Pro option, with a similar design and specs to the 13-inch model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Gurman’s report indicates that more than one M2-based MacBook will be released at WWDC, which could mean Apple is planning to refresh the current <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\">M2 MacBook Air</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/791082/13-inch-macbook-pro-m2-review.html\">13-inch MacBook Pro</a> as well.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"065dc2b8a6cffc6ca2105303f373cfbb1de855ef15181e3c1d2200deb95c1858","category":"Apple"}
