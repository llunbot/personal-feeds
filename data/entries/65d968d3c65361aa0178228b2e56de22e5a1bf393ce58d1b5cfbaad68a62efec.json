Lightweight, adapted race-ready gravity geometry, the same stiff-in-the-right-places/forgiving-in-others carbon that makes the regular Strive an all-day race bike, and the best-in-class Bosch CX motor with its optional Race version delivering the extra-long pedal-assist torque that sets it apart in e-enduro racing. Pick from 625Wh or 750Wh hot-swappable Bosch batteries, and act fast if you want to snap up the very limited hundred LTD models with the Race line motor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-StriveON-CF_carbon-eMTB-enduro-ebike_8.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-StriveON-CF_carbon-eMTB-enduro-ebike_8-800x444.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Strive:ON CF enduro race e-bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-StriveON-CF_carbon-eMTB-enduro-ebike_8-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-StriveON-CF_carbon-eMTB-enduro-ebike_8-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-StriveON-CF_carbon-eMTB-enduro-ebike_8-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-StriveON-CF_carbon-eMTB-enduro-ebike_8-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-StriveON-CF_carbon-eMTB-enduro-ebike_8-1536x853.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-StriveON-CF_carbon-eMTB-enduro-ebike_8.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-new carbon Canyon Strive:ON CF enduro ebike is available starting today in three models from the 5800€ Strive:ON Underdog with the smaller battery, up to the top 9700€ team edition Strive:ON CF LTD model in Fabien’s livery with the big battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon Torque:ON CF gravity freeride ebike, now in carbon</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_Sam-riding.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_Sam-riding-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Torque:ON CF freeride gravity bikepark eMTB ebike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_Sam-riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_Sam-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_Sam-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_Sam-riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_Sam-riding-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_Sam-riding-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_Sam-riding.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption><em>photo by Rupert Fowler</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But hot on its heels with a bit more travel, a bit stiffer frame, and a Shimano EP8 motor for riders who prefer to self-shuttle gravity trails all-day, the upgraded Torque:ON really isn’t very far behind. The big news here is that the geometry of the carbon Torque:ON has completely evolved from its alloy origins, taking gravity-racing inspiration from the new Strive:ON which was developed at the same time.

Interestingly the carbon frame was less about shedding weight as it was about improving descending performance. In fact, with the bigger range 720Wh &amp; 900Wh internal (<em>but swappable</em>) battery options, this carbon gravity ebike will likely be a bit heavier than the alloy ones that only spec smaller batteries.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_Roczen-edition.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_Roczen-edition-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Torque:ON CF gravity freeride ebike, now in carbon\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_Roczen-edition-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_Roczen-edition-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_Roczen-edition-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_Roczen-edition-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_Roczen-edition-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-TorqueON-CF_carbon-eMTB-gravity-freeride-ebike_Roczen-edition.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new carbon Canyon Torque:ON CF freeride ebike is available starting today in three models from the 6000€ Torque:ON CF 8 with the smaller battery to the top 9400€ team edition Torque:ON CF Roczen model with the big battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon Grand Canyon:ON alloy hardtail ebike</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-GrandCanyonON_entry-level-alloy-eMTB-hardtail-ebike_angled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-GrandCanyonON_entry-level-alloy-eMTB-hardtail-ebike_angled-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Grand Canyon:ON alloy hardtail ebike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-GrandCanyonON_entry-level-alloy-eMTB-hardtail-ebike_angled-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-GrandCanyonON_entry-level-alloy-eMTB-hardtail-ebike_angled-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-GrandCanyonON_entry-level-alloy-eMTB-hardtail-ebike_angled-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-GrandCanyonON_entry-level-alloy-eMTB-hardtail-ebike_angled-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-GrandCanyonON_entry-level-alloy-eMTB-hardtail-ebike_angled-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-GrandCanyonON_entry-level-alloy-eMTB-hardtail-ebike_angled-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Canyon-GrandCanyonON_entry-level-alloy-eMTB-hardtail-ebike_angled.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Strive:ON &amp; Torque:ON are all about ultra-high-performance ebiking, the Grand Canyon:ON is just an ebike.
