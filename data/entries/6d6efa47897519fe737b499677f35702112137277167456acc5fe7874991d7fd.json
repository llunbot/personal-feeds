{"title":"New Amazon EC2 High Memory U7inh instance on HPE Server for large in-memory databases","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-high-memory-u7inh-instance-on-hpe-server-for-large-in-memory-databases/","date":1734381018000,"content":"<p>Today we’re announcing the general availability of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</a> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/u7i/\">U7inh instance</a>, a new addition to EC2 High Memory family, built in collaboration with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). Amazon EC2 U7inh instance runs on the 16-socket HPE Compute Scale-up Server 3200, and are built on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/\">AWS Nitro System</a> to deliver a fully integrated and managed experience consistent with other EC2 instances.</p> \n<p>Powered by the fourth generation Intel<sup>®</sup> Xeon<sup>®</sup> Scalable processors (Sapphire Rapids), U7inh instance supports 32 TB of memory and 1920 vCPUs. This instance offers the highest compute performance, largest compute and memory size in the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> Cloud for running large, mission-critical database workloads, like SAP HANA.</p> \n<p>In May 2024, we launched <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-high-memory-u7i-instances-for-large-in-memory-databases/\">U7i instances</a> to support up to 896 vCPUs and up to 32 TB of memory, which our enterprise customers could use to successfully migrate their large mission-critical in-memory databases to AWS and benefit from the flexibility, scalability, reliability, and cost advantages that AWS offers.</p> \n<p>As customers continue to scale their business applications, they wanted the performance combined with the additional CPUs and memory along with SAP certification to generate real-time business insights. Other customers that currently run on-premises with HPE servers have also asked how we can help them migrate to AWS to take advantage of cloud benefits while continuing to use HPE hardware.</p> \n<p>Here are the detailed specs of new U7inh instance:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Instance name</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>vCPUs</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Memory (DDR5)</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>EBS bandwidth</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Network bandwidth</strong></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>U7inh-32tb.480xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>1920</td> \n   <td>32,768 GiB</td> \n   <td>160 Gbps</td> \n   <td>200 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>U7inh instance offers up to two times vCPUs and 1.6 times EBS bandwidth in a single instance, compared with the largest U7i instance. You can run your largest in-memory database workloads like SAP HANA or seamlessly migrate workloads running on HPE hardware to AWS.</p> \n<p>U7inh instance supports Amazon Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and SUSE Enterprise Linux Server. Operating system support for SAP HANA workloads on High Memory instances include: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3 for SAP and above and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6/9.0 for SAP and above.</p> \n<p>U7inh instance is SAP certified to run Business Suite on HANA (SoH), Business Suite S/4HANA, Business Warehouse on HANA (BW), and SAP BW/4HANA in production environments. U7inh instance is also certified for scale-out SAP HANA OLTP workloads such as S/4HANA and customers can deploy up to four U7inh instance (128TB) in a cluster for even larger SAP HANA workloads.</p> \n<p>To learn more about how to migrate, visit <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sap/latest/sap-hana/migrating-hana-to-hm.html\">Migrating SAP HANA on AWS to an EC2 High Memory Instance</a> in the SAP HANA on AWS Guides and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/launchwizard/latest/userguide/launch-wizard-sap.html\">AWS Launch Wizard for SAP</a> in the AWS Launch Wizard User Guide.</p> \n<p><u><strong>Now available</strong></u><br /> Amazon EC2 U7inh instance is available in the US East (N.
