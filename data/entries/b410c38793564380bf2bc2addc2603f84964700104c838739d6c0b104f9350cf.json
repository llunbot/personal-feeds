Augustine said a similar statement could sum up two previous high-level reviews of NASA's space programs that he chaired in 1990 and 2009. But the report released Tuesday put NASA's predicament in stark terms.</p>\n<h2>Grumbling about crumbling infrastructure</h2>\n<p>Around 83 percent of NASA's facilities are <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/08/nasas-buildings-are-even-older-than-its-graying-workforce/\">beyond their design lifetimes</a>, and the agency has a $3.3 billion backlog in maintenance. When you consider NASA's $250 million estimate for normal year-to-year maintenance, it would take a $600 million uptick in NASA's annual budget for infrastructure repairs to catch up on the backlog within the next 10 years.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049191#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049191&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b410c38793564380bf2bc2addc2603f84964700104c838739d6c0b104f9350cf","category":"Tech"}
