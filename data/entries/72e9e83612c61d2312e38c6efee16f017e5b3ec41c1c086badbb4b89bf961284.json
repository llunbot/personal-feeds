It’s provided by iconic Japanese bell manufacturer, <a href=\"https://www.cranebellco.com/\">Crane Bell Co</a>. and it looks like it’s drop bar-specific and pretty unique in its application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need a bell. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least I’m pretty sure you do. I can’t really speak to riding in many different places, but I can say riding around in Orange County, California can be pretty dangerous, to say the least. Our car culture here is strong, entrenched, and stocked full of entitled motorists. Even riding on crowded bike-specific trails can be really hazardous. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I’ve always used a bell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use a bell on every one of my bicycles, as I find it a super essential piece of gear when building up a bike. As you may or may not know, my bell of choice is the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-spurcycle-original-bicycle-bell/\">Spurcycle Original</a>. However, on drop bras, my hands are rarely in a spot where it’s intuitive to use. But this one… </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The E-Ne SBR Bell</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-side-shot.jpeg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-side-shot.jpeg\" alt=\"Crane Bell E-Ne SBR Bell side shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-side-shot.jpeg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-side-shot-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-side-shot-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-side-shot-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-side-shot-768x768.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c.

Which means your hands can stay near the brakes, which is key when riding near enough to people that you’d want to use your bell. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also well-built, something we’ve come to expect from Crane Bell Co. The E-Ne SBR Bell’s clamp is made of aluminum, not plastic. Soma says it’s brass bell’s ring quality is great, even on the Stealth Black version. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-brass-e1697041554102.jpeg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"558\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-brass-e1697041554102.jpeg\" alt=\"Crane Bell E-Ne SBR Bell brass\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-brass-e1697041554102.jpeg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-brass-e1697041554102-297x162.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-brass-e1697041554102-800x436.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-brass-e1697041554102-120x65.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-brass-e1697041554102-768x419.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Copper</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-copper-e1697041479826.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-copper.jpeg\" alt=\"Crane Bell E-Ne SBR Bell copper\" /></a><figcaption>Brass</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-chrome-plate-e1697041532215.jpeg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"568\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-chrome-plate-e1697041532215.jpeg\" alt=\"Crane Bell E-Ne SBR Bell chrome plate\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-chrome-plate-e1697041532215.jpeg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-chrome-plate-e1697041532215-297x165.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-chrome-plate-e1697041532215-800x444.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-chrome-plate-e1697041532215-120x67.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-chrome-plate-e1697041532215-768x426.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Chrome Plate</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-chrome-e1697041511507.jpeg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-chrome-e1697041511507.jpeg\" alt=\"Crane Bell E-Ne SBR Bell chrome\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-chrome-e1697041511507.jpeg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-chrome-e1697041511507-297x149.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-chrome-e1697041511507-800x400.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-chrome-e1697041511507-120x60.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-chrome-e1697041511507-768x384.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>All Chrome Plate</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-stealth-black-e1697041494882.jpeg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-stealth-black-e1697041494882.jpeg\" alt=\"Crane Bell E-Ne SBR Bell stealth black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-stealth-black-e1697041494882.jpeg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-stealth-black-e1697041494882-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-stealth-black-e1697041494882-800x450.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-stealth-black-e1697041494882-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-stealth-black-e1697041494882-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Crane-Bell-E-Ne-SBR-Bell-stealth-black-e1697041494882-400x225.jpeg 400w\" /></a><figcaption>All Black</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes in 5 different colors – Brass, Copper, All Chrome Plate, Chrome Plate, and All Black.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The E-Ne SBR Bell is available now at the Soma Fab Shop, link below.
