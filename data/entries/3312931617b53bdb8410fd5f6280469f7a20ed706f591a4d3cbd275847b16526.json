Many thousands of people are\nwithout power and/or cell service. But in the wake of the storm,\nreports have surfaced about a <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/10/dont-have-a-connection-ios-18-lets-you-send-messages-with-your-iphone-over-satellite/\">key iOS 18 feature</a> that has\nbeen a lifeline for survivors: Messages via satellite.</p>\n\n<p>Apple added Messages via satellite to millions of iPhones via its\nrecent iOS 18 update. And now, according to reports on social\nmedia, it seems the feature arrived just in time. Here are a few\ntweets highlighting how useful the feature has proven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s great that iOS 18 shipped before Helene hit, but a shame that it’s so new that most users <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/ios-version-market-share/\">haven’t yet upgraded</a>. And once Helene hit and knocked out all comms in the most severely-hit areas, it was too late. (Apple hasn’t yet pushed iOS 18 to the majority of users whose devices are set to install updates automatically, and typically doesn’t do so with new iOS versions until the .1 release in October or November.) Some heads-up people were specifically recommending that iPhone 14 and 15 users in Helene’s path update to iOS 18 before it hit specifically to get this feature. But still: <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/120930\">the feature</a> is already making a huge difference.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/03/messages-via-satellite-hurricane-helene\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3312931617b53bdb8410fd5f6280469f7a20ed706f591a4d3cbd275847b16526","category":"Tech"}
