The new AirPods are rumored to feature a similar design as the AirPods Pro, but without Active Noise Cancellation, and they could have improved sound quality and some other new features.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe third-generation AirPods have already been manufactured and are ready to launch, according to Wedbush's supply chain checks, which increases the likelihood that they will be announced during the Apple Event next week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier this week, an account on Chinese social media platform Weibo known as @PandaIsBald <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/new-airpods-during-unleashed-apple-event/\">also claimed that third-generation AirPods will be announced at the Apple Event next week</a>. Last month, the same account accurately revealed that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/low-cost-ipad-debut-apple-event/\">would announce the ninth-generation iPad at its September event</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis would be the first update to the standard AirPods since the second-generation AirPods were released in March 2019. The second-generation AirPods are priced at $159 with a wired charging case and at $199 with a wireless charging case.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAn update to the AirPods Pro is not expected until next year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2021-apple-event/\">October 2021 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/15/airpods-3-likely-at-unleashed-apple-event/\">AirPods 3 Ready to Launch and Likely to Be Announced at Apple Event Next Week, Analyst Says</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-3-ready-to-launch-and-likely-to-be-announced-at-apple-event-next-week-analyst-says.2317069/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZKFGXKio0cA:5-qre1Zfufw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZKFGXKio0cA:5-qre1Zfufw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ZKFGXKio0cA\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f68b487b7fe8579145ceff8c2757d6345e5019d2fe046d25f385dcb5224bcd99","category":"Apple"}
