Most notably, there is a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/07/study-zombie-ant-death-grip-comes-from-muscle-contractions-not-the-brain/\">family of zombifying parasitic fungi</a> called <em>Cordyceps</em>—more than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordyceps\">400 different species</a>, each targeting a particular insect species, whether it be ants, dragonflies, cockroaches, aphids, or beetles. In fact, <em>Cordyceps</em> inspired the premise of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/07/study-zombie-ant-death-grip-comes-from-muscle-contractions-not-the-brain/\"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> game and subsequent TV series. And earlier this month <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/how-these-parasitic-worms-turn-brown-shrimp-into-bright-orange-zombies/\">we reported</a> on a <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.17093\">study of how</a> a parasitic worm (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematoda\">trematode</a>) targets a particular species of marsh-dwelling brown shrimp (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphipoda\">amphipod</a>), turning the shrimp an orange hue and altering the host shrimp's behavior.</p>\n<p>Then there's the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicrocoelium_dendriticum\">lancet liver fluke</a>, whose complicated life cycle relies on successfully invading successive hosts: snails, ants, and grazing mammals. (Some liver flukes have also been known to infect the occasional <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/watch-this-beautifully-disgusting-liver-fluke-parasite-explore-mans-innards/\">unfortunate human</a>.) Scientists at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark have discovered that the way the liver fluke \"zombifies\" ants to alter their behavior incorporates a kind of \"on/off\" switch that, in turn, is dependent on temperature. The researcherse described their findings in a <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/beheco/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/beheco/arad064/7250300?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">recent paper</a> published in the journal Behavioral Ecology.</p>\n<p>\"Historically, parasites have never really been focused on that much, despite there being scientific sources which say that parasitism is the most widespread life form,\"<a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1001541\"> said co-author Brian Lund Fredensborg</a>. \"This is in part due to the fact that parasites are quite difficult to study. Nevertheless, the hidden world of parasites forms a significant part of biodiversity, and by changing the host's behavior, they can help determine who eats what in nature. That's why they're important for us to understand.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969792#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969792&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dabcec301884c19984fafa792f266df30094c08cb2862f427913aa77002d476a","category":"Tech"}
