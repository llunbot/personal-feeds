They might post a photo on Instagram, thanking the rider for their service, but generally, that’s about it. They don’t tend to make a touching highlights video for the departing rider, and send them on their way with genuine fondness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But on Tuesday, that’s exactly what Team BikeExchange did for Colombian star Esteban Chaves. The 31-year-old is off to EF Education Nippo in 2022 after eight years with the GreenEdge setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chaves joined the Australian team back in 2014, a year after suffering serious injuries in a crash during a race in Italy. For parts of 2013 it looked like Chaves’ career might be over. But in joining Orica-GreenEdge, Chaves didn’t just make a return to racing; he also joined the WorldTour ranks for the first time, became one of Colombia’s most successful cyclists, and also one of the most-loved riders in the entire pro peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among Chaves’ career highlights with GreenEdge: victory at Il Lombardia in 2016 (the first Colombian to win a Monument), three stage wins at the Giro d’Italia, two stage wins at the Vuelta a España, second overall at the Giro in 2016, and third overall at the Vuelta in 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chaves leaves BikeExchange with many good memories. Clearly the team has many good memories too, judging by the video it pulled together.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f1e6-1f1fa.png\" /> 8 incredible years that changed me and my family's life.
