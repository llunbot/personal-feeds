{"title":"The End of Computer Magazines in America","link":"https://www.technologizer.com/2023/04/15/the-end-of-computer-magazines-in-america/","date":1681847018000,"content":"\n<p>Harry McCracken, writing at Technologizer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The April issues of Maximum PC and MacLife are currently on sale\nat a newsstand near you — assuming there is a newsstand near\nyou. They’re the last print issues of these two venerable\ncomputer magazines, both of which date to 1996 (and were\noriginally known, respectively, as Boot and MacAddict). Starting\nwith their next editions, both publications will be available in\ndigital form only.</p>\n\n<p>But I’m not writing this article because the dead-tree versions of\nMaximum PC and MacLife are no more. I’m writing it because they\nwere the last two extant U.S. computer magazines that had managed\nto cling to life until now. With their abandonment of print, the\ncomputer magazine era has officially ended. [...]</p>\n\n<p>I take the loss personally, and not just because computer\nmagazines kept me gainfully employed from 1991-2008. As a junior\nhigh student and <a href=\"https://techland.time.com/2012/08/03/trs-80/\">Radio Shack TRS-80 fanatic</a>, I bought my\nfirst computer magazine in late 1978, three years after Byte\ninvented the category. It was a momentous enough moment in my life\nthat I can tell you what it was (the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing-1978-11\">November-December 1978 issue\nof Creative Computing</a>) and where I got it (Harvard Square’s\nOut of Town News, the same newsstand that had <a href=\"https://www.technologizer.com/2009/01/02/the-newsstand-that-spawned-microsoft-is-set-to-close/\">played a critical\nrole in the founding of Microsoft just four years earlier)</a>.\nEven before I purchased that Creative Computing , our mailman had\nmisdelivered a neighbor’s copy of Byte to our house, an error I\nwelcomed and did not attempt to correct. From the moment I\ndiscovered computer magazines, I loved them almost as much as I\nloved computers, which is why I ended up working in the field for\nso long.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As McCracken himself notes, it’s impossible to overstate the essential role computer magazines played before the web. I read Macworld and MacUser cover-to-cover every month. Magazines were how you learned to do stuff, how you learned about new applications and new hardware products, how you learned what you might want to buy. When I eventually started writing occasional back-page columns for Macworld, it was an indescribable thrill.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/18/computer-magazines-mccracken\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0b444d3c6c9740e06879cec20ef9d106b80bf5b6bfe5434210acd85b7c2b7ae8","category":"Tech"}
