This week, we discuss an intriguing new report looking at Starship. Most fascinating, the report covers SpaceX's costs to build a Starship and how these costs will come down as the company ramps up its build and launch cadence. At the other end of the spectrum, former NASA Administrator Mike Griffin has a plan to get astronauts back to the Moon that would wholly ignore the opportunities afforded by Starship.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smalll.png\" /></div>\n<p><b>The problem at America's military spaceports. </b>The Biden administration is requesting $1.3 billion over the next five years to revamp infrastructure at the Space Force's ranges in Florida and California, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/military-officials-foresee-launch-ranges-becoming-more-like-airports/\">Ars reports</a>. This will help address things like roads, bridges, utilities, and airfields that, in many cases, haven't seen an update in decades. But it's not enough, according to the Space Force. Last year, Cape Canaveral was the departure point for 72 orbital rocket launches, and officials anticipate more than 100 this year. The infrastructure and workforce at the Florida spaceport could support about 150 launches in a year without any major changes, but launch activity is likely to exceed that number within a few years.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997065#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997065&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b56ecac73bf34d864bf655aedbfc6470bd93dabab5b4894595d81a2586e4b371","category":"Tech"}
