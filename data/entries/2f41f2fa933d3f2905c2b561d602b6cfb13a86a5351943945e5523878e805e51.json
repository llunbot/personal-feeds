This means that a walker, runner or rider could, on average, encounter a piece of rubbish every 24 metres. For context that’s 41 per kilometre, which equates to 2,460 in a 60km gravel ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most littered trails are public rights of way and plastic bottles and sweet and crisp wrappers were by far the largest type of trash found. These alone accounted for 37% of all itemised items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tragically, over a fifth of recorded ‘animal interactions’ with litter ended in death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data set is taken from July 2020 to August 2023, supplemented by some social media observations and Ferris’s master’s thesis. Overall, 700 datasets were collected by volunteers around the country and analysed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who is implicated?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/03120518/spring_trail_clean_21_bristol_c_sam_dugon-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"spring_trail_clean_21_bristol_c_sam_dugon\" /><figcaption>Sam Dugon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably several sports nutrition brands feature in the top 20 list of the most found litter. The report highlights Lucozade as the top brand of single-use drinks container found, while RedBull and Coca-Cola follow behind. SiS and High 5, who produce sports energy gels, bars and hydration tabs, are both in the top 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trash Free Trails found A ‘Science in Sport’ (SIS) gel sachet with clear chew/shred marks within one month of the start of the experiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trash Free Trails is calling for a UK government policy change. ‘We want sports nutrition producers to put retention straps on their gels,’ says Ferris. ‘It is the producer responsibility, so we are calling for a policy change.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What have the brands said about it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Unity-Woods-C-Ian-Lean-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Unity-Woods-C-Ian-Lean-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Unity-Woods-C-Ian-Lean-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Unity-Woods-C-Ian-Lean-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Unity-Woods-C-Ian-Lean-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Unity-Woods-C-Ian-Lean-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Unity-Woods-C-Ian-Lean-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Unity-Woods-C-Ian-Lean-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Unity-Woods-C-Ian-Lean-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Unity-Woods-C-Ian-Lean-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Unity-Woods-C-Ian-Lean-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Ian Lean</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Their silence has been deafening for the large part,’ says Ferris. ‘Except for RedBull UK, who we have been working with.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘In the four years we have called out Lucozade, the company has responded twice, usually on Twitter. Usually we get boilerplate answers or a company will direct the blame to its consumers. But the time has come for companies to embrace acknowledgement, transparency and accountability.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to these comments, the owners of Lucozade got in touch.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We hate to see our empty bottles end up anywhere other than in a recycling bin,’ says a spokesperson from Suntory Beverage &amp; Food GB&amp;I who own Lucozade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We want an end to littering – not only because it is damaging our environment, but because it is a waste of valuable resources. We support the introduction of well-designed Deposit Return Schemes across the UK. Like other schemes run across the world, DRS will help consumers understand plastic bottles are valuable, boost recycling rates and massively reduce littering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We agree that we have a responsibility to help manage where our packaging ends up which is something we already do through the Packaging Recycling Notes system and report on with Extended Producer Responsibility.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It remains to be seen whether the owners of Lucozade’s comments will translate into action, and whether the brand’s plastic bottles will still be found littering the trails in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyclist has reached out to SiS and High 5 for comment and so far has not received any response.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/trash-free-trails\">How Trash Free Trails is protecting the routes we ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-hidden-cost-of-the-tour\">Examining the environmental impact of the Tour de France</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-green-is-cycling-kit\">How green is my jersey?

By carrying out the report, Trash Free Trails hopes to influence policymakers, brands and riders, runners and walkers to look after our trails better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key element of the State of the Trails report looks at the language around litter, arguing that we need to ‘call it what it is’, swapping the phrase litter for single-use pollution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘In 1953 the word litter was created to shift the blame onto consumers and the way we use the word now isn’t accurate,’ explains Ferris ‘The reason we, Trash Free Trails, use the phrase single-use pollution instead is because we are talking about items which are designed to be single-use and harm the environment. By definition this is single-use pollution.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second key point of the report is around connecting people with nature. In 2024 Trash Free Trails will launch a Purposeful Adventure Fund to support organisations, funds and individuals that are providing opportunities for people that have never experienced nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report has raised awareness about the single-use pollution on trails and local communities have removed over 216,000 individual items of litter from over 5,000km of UK trails as part of its efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organisation also calls for a change in policy including the banning of disposable vapes immediately, a Deposit Return Scheme (DRS) and support for the UN Plastics treaty 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Above all, the State of our Trails report highlights the shared responsibility of single-use pollution, the importance of helping people develop a connection with nature, and driving meaningful action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the full report and information on how to get involved, head to <a href=\"https://www.trashfreetrails.org/2023-state-of-our-trails-report\" target=\"_blank\">Trash Free Trails</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uk-trails-litter\">Trash Free Trails report finds 41 items of litter per km on UK trails</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Emma Cole &#124; Features Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"2f41f2fa933d3f2905c2b561d602b6cfb13a86a5351943945e5523878e805e51","category":"Cycling"}
