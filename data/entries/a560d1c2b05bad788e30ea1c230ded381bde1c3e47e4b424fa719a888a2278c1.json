Below, we highlight seven of the oldest and most obscure products that Apple still sells in 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-and-Often-Forgotten-Products-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nMany of these products are unlikely to be updated ever again, and it's unclear how long Apple will continue to sell them on its online store.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>SuperDrive</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-SuperDrives.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIntroduced alongside the original MacBook Air in 2008, the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD564LL/A/apple-usb-superdrive\">USB SuperDrive</a> is an external CD/DVD drive. It remains available on Apple's online store for $79, but you'll need a USB-A to USB-C adapter to use it with a modern MacBook.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe last MacBook with a built-in CD/DVD drive was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/27/apple-discontinues-non-retina-macbook-pro/\">discontinued in 2016</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>MagSafe Converter</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-MagSafe-Adapters.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nFor just $9.99, you can own Apple's tiny <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD504LL/A/magsafe-to-magsafe-2-converter\">MagSafe to MagSafe 2 converter</a>. This adapter allows Apple's very-old Thunderbolt Display to charge an also-very-old MacBook Pro or MacBook Air equipped with a MagSafe 2 connector.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor those counting, Apple moved on to MagSafe 3 in 2021.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>EarPods With 3.5mm Plug</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-EarPods-With-3.5mm-Plugs.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone starting with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus back in 2016, but it continues to sell wired <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-35mm-headphone-plug\">EarPods with a 3.5mm headphone plug</a> for $19. You can also get EarPods <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/earpods-usb-c-lightning-or-headphone-plug/\">with Lightning or USB-C</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHey, Macs still have a headphone jack.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>30-Pin to USB Cable</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-30-Pin-Connectors.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nStill rocking out with an older iPod or iPhone? Apple has you covered with its <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MA591G/C/apple-30-pin-to-usb-cable\">30-pin to USB cable</a>, featuring breakthrough USB 2.0 technology from the early 2000s.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPro tip: you can get one for much cheaper on Amazon if you really need one.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Mac Pro Security Lock Adapter</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-Mac-Pro-Security-Lock-Adapters.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWant to keep your 2013 Mac Pro secure in 2024? Apple's <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MF858AM/A/mac-pro-security-lock-adapter\">$49 adapter</a> lets you attach a compatible Kensington lock to the computer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe're honestly surprised Apple still sells this one.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Link Bracelet</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-Link-Bracelets.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple hasn't updated the stainless steel <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU9A3AM/A/42mm-silver-link-bracelet\">Link Bracelet</a> since the original Apple Watch was released in 2015. The band is still listed in its original 38mm and 42mm sizes for $449, and it no longer perfectly matches the colors of some newer Apple Watch models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Mac Pro Wheels</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-Mac-Pro-Wheels-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nFor the low price of $699, you can <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX572ZM/A/apple-mac-pro-wheels-kit\">add wheels</a> to your 2019 or newer Mac Pro tower, allowing it to roll around. Or, you could <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvAX1vQJnAU\">install them on a skateboard</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's also a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXNM2ZM/A/apple-mac-pro-feet-kit\">Mac Pro feet kit</a> for $299 in this economy.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/old-apple-products-list/\">Apple Still Selling These Old and Often Forgotten Products in 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-selling-these-old-and-often-forgotten-products-in-2024.2415329/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a560d1c2b05bad788e30ea1c230ded381bde1c3e47e4b424fa719a888a2278c1","category":"Apple"}
