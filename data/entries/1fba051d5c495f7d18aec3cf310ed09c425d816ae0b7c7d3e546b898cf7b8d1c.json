According to a new rumor, that’s very much not the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/goertek-secures-npi-supplier-for-two-new-apple-products-in-2026-apple-business-set-to-resume-80f31db1dd4e\">Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reports</a> that Apple will make “its first foray into the smart home IP camera market” with a new device launching in 2026. It would represent Apple’s first standalone camera since 2003’s iSight camera and its first smart home device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not clear whether the camera is meant to be used indoors or outdoors, but Kuo says it “is designed to integrate seamlessly with other Apple hardware products via wireless connectivity.” Kuo says the move “demonstrates Apple’s continued exploration of growth opportunities in the home market” and believes “the user experience will be significantly enhanced by Apple’s great ecosystem and deep integration with Apple Intelligence and Siri.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is in the process of rolling out Apple Intelligence features, so a 2026 release makes sense. Apple is also expected to launch a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with a screen</a>, which will likely be closely tied to this new device, perhaps even releasing simultaneously. Apple already offers <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1388132/how-to-export-video-homekit-secure-video-camera.html\">HomeKit Secure Video</a>, which brings end-to-end encryption for HomeKit-enabled cameras, but users have reported issues with certain manufacturers. An Apple-branded camera will presumably fix these issues.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1fba051d5c495f7d18aec3cf310ed09c425d816ae0b7c7d3e546b898cf7b8d1c","category":"Apple"}
