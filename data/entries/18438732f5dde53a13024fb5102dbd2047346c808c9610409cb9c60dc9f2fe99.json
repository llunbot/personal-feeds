By comparison, the smaller iPhone 15 Pro remains limited to up to 3x optical zoom, in line with the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt has been rumored that the iPhone 16 Pro will feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/\">larger 6.3-inch display</a>, compared to the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro. This change would increase the overall size of the device, which would provide additional internal space for a tetraprism lens.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-pro-models-larger-periscope/\">not the first time</a> that Kuo has said the lens would expand to both iPhone 16 Pro models, but it reveals that the change is still planned following the introduction of the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which launches this Friday.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/\">iPhone 15 Pro Max's 5x Optical Zoom Lens Rumored to Expand to Both iPhone 16 Pro Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-maxs-5x-optical-zoom-lens-rumored-to-expand-to-both-iphone-16-pro-models.2403024/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"18438732f5dde53a13024fb5102dbd2047346c808c9610409cb9c60dc9f2fe99","category":"Apple"}
