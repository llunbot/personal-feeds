He said this upgrade will make Siri more like OpenAI's ChatGPT, allowing the assistant to \"handle more sophisticated requests.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will likely unveil the revamped Siri when it unveils iOS 19 at WWDC 2025 next June, but Gurman said it will not be available until as early as spring 2026. That suggests the feature will be released as part of an iOS 19.4 update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn the meantime, iOS 18.2 added <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-ios-18-2-update/\">ChatGPT integration to Siri</a>, and Gurman expects an integration with Google's Gemini to follow in a later update. And <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/22/apple-intelligence-features-timing/\">with iOS 18.4</a>, Siri will gain on-screen awareness, deeper per-app controls, and a few other enhancements, but it will still not offer fully-fledged ChatGPT-like conversational abilities directly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Delayed Features</h2>\r<br />\nGurman revealed that some other features have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/ios-19-rumors/\">\"postponed\" until iOS 19.4</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"I'm told that a larger-than-usual number of features scheduled for iOS 19 (beyond the new Siri) are already postponed until spring 2026 (when iOS 19.4 debuts),\" he said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe did not provide any specific details about the features that are pushed back.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/ios-18-updates-cause-ios-19-delays/\">attributed the delay to the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence features</a> between iOS 18.1 and iOS 18.4, which is preventing some Apple software engineers from moving on to iOS 19 development. In line with this information, an unnamed source within Apple told French website iPhoneSoft.fr that they are still working on iOS 18 development.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Compatible iPhones</h2>\r<br />\nAccording to French website iPhoneSoft.fr, iOS 19 will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/22/ios-19-compatible-iphones-rumor/\">compatible with any iPhone that is capable of running iOS 18</a>, which would mean the following models:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 16</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 16 Plus</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 16 Pro</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 16 Pro Max</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 15</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 15 Plus</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 15 Pro</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 15 Pro Max</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 14</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 14 Plus</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 14 Pro</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 14 Pro Max</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 13</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 13 mini</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 13 Pro</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 13 Pro Max</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 12</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 12 mini</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 12 Pro</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 12 Pro Max</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 11</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 11 Pro</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone 11 Pro Max</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone XS</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone XS Max</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone XR</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPhone SE (2nd generation or later)</li>\r<br />\n</ul>The oldest devices in that list are the iPhone XS, iPhone XS, and iPhone XR, all of which were released in September 2018.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOf course, some iOS 19 features will be unavailable on older iPhone models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf this report is accurate, it would be the second year in a row in which Apple did not drop support for any iPhone models with its major annual iOS release. iOS 18 is compatible with the same iPhone models as iOS 17 is.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17 dropped support for the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Timing</h2>\r<br />\nThe first iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 betas should be released during WWDC 2025 next June, and the updates are likely to be released in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/23/what-to-expect-from-ios-19-so-far/\">What to Expect From iOS 19: All the Rumors So Far</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-ios-19-all-the-rumors-so-far.2445989/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1d376df801f438c79951f58b57d9e5ba4ae7ff5a071f06b13cd3e5ab7348fa07","category":"Apple"}
