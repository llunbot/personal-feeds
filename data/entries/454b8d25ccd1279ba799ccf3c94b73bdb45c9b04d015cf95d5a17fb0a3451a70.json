{"title":"Behind The Scenes: DC Rainmaker Cave Tour","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/12/behind-scenes-rainmaker-cave.html","date":1702224132000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>Last weekend was the annual DCR Open House, which was the most packed it’s ever been. However, after the beer, tech, and dust settled, Matt Legrand spent the following morning doing a full tour of the DCR Cave. And atop that, a bit of an inside look at how I put together reviews. If you aren’t familiar with Matt’s channel, he covers sports tech including wearables, triathlon, indoor cycling, and plenty more.</p>\n<p>He and his son flew over for the Open House (and presumably to sample various Dutch food delicacies). The above video outlines pretty much all aspects of the cave. But more than the cave, I take him through the day-to-day process of the workflow. From how tech stuff arrives at the DCR Cave, to unboxing, shooting, organization, and plenty more.</p>\n<p>It’s a fun look behind the scenes that actually has a bit of a story woven through it. Maybe one day I’ll tell the story of that gondola…</p>\n<p>Give it a watch, and a subscribe – Matt’s doing awesome work in the sports tech space!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"454b8d25ccd1279ba799ccf3c94b73bdb45c9b04d015cf95d5a17fb0a3451a70","category":"Cycling"}
