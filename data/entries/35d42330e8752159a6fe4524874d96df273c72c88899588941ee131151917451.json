But he still needed to finish to keep the Green Jersey as the leader of the 2024 Tour de France points competition. So, Ere had him and the Intermarché-Wanty covered when it came to going fast solo…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Custom green ERE Research Genus AE00-D &amp; 92-D TT wheels for Biniam Girmay</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-Leon-van-Bon_front-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-Leon-van-Bon_front-detail.jpg\" alt=\"ERE Research custom green Genus AE disc aero time trial wheels for 2024 TdF green jersey winner Biniam Girmay, front wheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-Leon-van-Bon_front-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-Leon-van-Bon_front-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-Leon-van-Bon_front-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-Leon-van-Bon_front-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-Leon-van-Bon_front-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-Leon-van-Bon_front-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-Leon-van-Bon_front-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/leon_van_bon/\" target=\"_blank\">Leon van Bon</a>/ERE)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, Biniam was 135th on the 21st day of racing, 9 seconds behind his ‘idol’ Cavendish, and more than 9 minutes back from winner Tadej Pogačar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But only 141/175 riders made it all the way to the finish in Nice, so that was still a solid accomplishment for the sprinter after 7 mountain stages and 4 hilly days.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-CyclingMedia-Agency_2024-Tour-Stage-21-ITT.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-CyclingMedia-Agency_2024-Tour-Stage-21-ITT.jpg\" alt=\"2024 TdF green jersey winner Biniam Girmay in finishing Stage 21 individual time trial\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-CyclingMedia-Agency_2024-Tour-Stage-21-ITT.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-CyclingMedia-Agency_2024-Tour-Stage-21-ITT-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-CyclingMedia-Agency_2024-Tour-Stage-21-ITT-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-CyclingMedia-Agency_2024-Tour-Stage-21-ITT-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ERE-Research-custom-green-Genus-AE-disc-aero-time-trial-wheels-2024-TdF-Biniam-Girmay_photo-by-CyclingMedia-Agency_2024-Tour-Stage-21-ITT-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo by Alessandro Volders of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cyclingmedia_agency/\" target=\"_blank\">CyclingMedia Agency</a>/Intermarché-Wanty)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ere Research were happy to share the custom wheelset they made for Biniam… and to give us a good look at his Aerium TT bike setup, as well.

And they aren’t more expensive than other less-radical TT wheels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The disc Genus AE00-D sells for 1700€ and is available now for Shimano builds (SRAM is on backorder). The 92mm deep front wheel is available separately for 900€. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not exactly affordable, but it is the same price as Ere’s previous TT wheels. So at least you get a performance upgrade, without having to pay more than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.ereresearch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">EREresearch.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/unique-stepped-ere-research-genus-disc-wheel-on-biniams-tour-cube-aerium-tt-bike/\">Unique Stepped ERE Research Genus Disc Wheel on Biniam’s Tour Cube Aerium TT Bike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"35d42330e8752159a6fe4524874d96df273c72c88899588941ee131151917451","category":"Cycling"}
