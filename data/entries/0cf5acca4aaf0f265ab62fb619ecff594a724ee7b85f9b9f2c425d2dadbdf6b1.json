It might have been at Hangtime, a women-focused free-ride event in town that I’ve photographed. It might have been one of many dinners we have here in Bellingham to stave off winter’s darkness and dampness. It might have been when I photographed her for some new jorts. I later photographed her for a SRAM GX launch.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-01.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-01.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-02.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-02.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Paul photographed Black for a SRAM GX Transmission launch in 2024…</em></p>\n<p>Regardless, I think the initial idea for this series was subconsciously born when I said that I loved her Land Cruiser and she said that it had never been in a photo shoot. So, finally, at last, we can let Blake’s FZJ80 Lecus LX have its moment. Here is the cruiser in all of its patina glory.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Toyota or Lexus?</h3>\n<p>For those who don’t know, Lexus is Toyota’s luxury brand. There are many theories about the name. Is it a combination of “luxury and elegance?” Is it a contraction of “luxury export to the US?” The brand has never explicitly stated where the name comes from besides the fact that it gives off a vibe of technological capability and luxurious refinement.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-12.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The 80-series Land Cruiser is one of the most coveted SUVs. It is the last US-market Toyota with a solid front axle and has full-time four-wheel drive, i.e., you’re always driving in 4-high but can shift into 4-low via the transfer case. In offroading, maintaining contact with the ground for traction and stability is everything. A solid axle pushes one wheel down while the wheel on the opposite side is pushed up, forcing the wheels into the undulations of the terrain.</p>\n<p>After the 80 series, all Toyota trucks have used independent front suspension, which provides superior on-road handling and suspension performance at higher speeds but isn’t as traction-hungry in slower, rockier situations.</p>\n<p>The 80 series is still perfectly capable of regular vehicle duties, which is part of the reason it is such a desirable vehicle. Even the nicest 80 series is pushing 30 years old, so well-maintained specimens command a hefty price and frequently sell for the same price as a modern SUV, and sometimes more.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Toyota initially released the 80 series in 1990 as the FJ80. It had the 3F-E engine, which was reliable yet considered underpowered for the size of its mated vehicle. In 1992, Toyota added the more powerful 1FZ-FE as an additional engine option and a few other upgrades like rear disc brakes instead of the FZ’s drum brakes (see: better).</p>\n<p>For the last two years of the model run (1996-1997), these trucks were also sold under the Lexus brand as LX450, a hilariously blatant rebadge of the Toyota product. The only differences were Lexus badging, a leather interior, and paint only available to the luxury model. It would take a second generation of the Lexus LX to start to look a little different.</p>\n<p>The 100 series rebadge at least featured different headlights. To this day, Lexus and Toyota still have essentially identical vehicles with slightly different fascia, especially when you look at what is available in overseas markets.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Blake’s 80 has the coveted full-floating rear axle with special Lexus-issued chrome wheels</em></p>\n<p>My favorite features of the 80-series Land Cruiser are the sliding rear windows, two-piece tailgate (truck stuff), and a full-floating rear axle. This means if you ever break your axle studs, your wheels won’t fall off like a semi-float axle. It’s also stronger, easier to service, and, unlike the earlier 80 Series releases, has disc brakes. These are the most apparent features that my Land Cruiser Prado doesn’t have. In a later post, we’ll feature my own vehicle.</p>\n<p>Previous to the Land Cruiser, Blake had several Toyotas, including a Toyota Pickup that a neighbor routinely tried to buy from her and a 2nd generation 4Runner. For most Toyota people, Land Cruisers are the end-all acquisition. For Blake, it was no different. She found this one in the driveway of a friend’s neighbor. Eventually, it had a for-sale sign on it. The right truck for the right price was too good to pass up.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-17.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Onto the Bike: Specialized STATUS 2 140</h3>\n<p>Blake is a professional free-rider for Specialized. She was recently invited to shadow the judging process at Redbull Rampage, the first to feature female riders. Her STATUS 2 140 reflects those sendy tendencies. It’s burly, it’s capable, and it’s made of Metal. It’s built with some of her signature colorway components from Bellingham’s Tenet Components. How many trail bikes do you see rolling around town with brake hoses routed through the steerer tube for bar spins?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-20.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Status is an interesting bike, perhaps because of its oddly covert marketing strategy rather than its features. It was first revealed on professional riders’ social media when it came out. Even after it was available from select bike shops, it was easiest to find information about it from some grom at the local pump track. The goal was to drive interest among the young, gravity-focused crowd with an alluring and exclusive feeling marketing strategy.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-04.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-04.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-03.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-03.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Blake-Hansen-Radical-Rigs-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Paul photographed Black for a SRAM GX Transmission launch in 2024…</em></p>\n<p>Unlike exclusive bikes, it is affordable. A few years later, it is now in its second iteration: a simple and capable rig at a stellar value. Much like the analog and gimmick-free vehicles I love, it is a refreshingly bare-bones offering in Specialized’s engineering and acronym-heavy catalog.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-14.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Radica_Rigs_Blake_Hansen-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>For those who might be Cruiser curious, Blake’s 450 is for sale.
