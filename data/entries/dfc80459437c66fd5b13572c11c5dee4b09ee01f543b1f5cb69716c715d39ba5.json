You can reduce the monetary jolt by switching your search to USB4, which, being an outgrowth of Intel’s PCIe over-a-wire technology is just as fast as Thunderbolt 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s significantly cheaper than Thunderbolt, especially if you roll your own with something such as the UGreen CM850 NVMe M.2 enclosure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CM850 is a more affordable version of the Ugreen’s CM642 that uses the same ASMedia ASM2464PD chip. It’s a gun-metal gray aluminum enclosure that’s approximately 4.75 by 2.1 by 0.6 inches and weighs 4.4 ounces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its heft is nice, as is the top panel that pops off to reveal the internal M.2/NVMe slot that supports 2230 (22mm wide, 30mm long) to 2280 SSDs secured by a captive screw. The panel doesn’t have small screws to deal with (or lose).</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UGreen-CM850-interior-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UGreen-CM850-interior-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UGreen-CM850-interior-1.jpg?resize=300%2C141&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UGreen-CM850-interior-1.jpg?resize=768%2C361&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UGreen-CM850-interior-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C565&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UGreen-CM850-interior-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C723&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"565\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>The CM850’s interior M.2 slot. Note the fan underneath the screw that’s used to secure the NVMe SSD.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Your options on the Mac for 20Gbps/40Gbps performance are Thunderbolt 3, 4, or 5, all of which involve significantly pricier enclosures, and are not supported on the majority of Windows machines. That can be important if you work in a mixed environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding an NVMe SSD to the CM850 will cost you anywhere from $40 (256GB) to $650 (8TB), with the sweet spot being the 1TB ($60) to 2TB ($160) range. Note that USB4 (or Thunderbolt for that matter) can’t use the extra bandwidth provided by PCIe 4.0 or 5.0 SSDs. PCIe 3.0 SSDs are quickly disappearing, but the point is, don’t overbuy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond that, avoid QLC SSDs if you regularly write large amounts of data, and buy a DRAM design if you’re going to run an operating system off the drive or want top random performance. The best bang for the buck however will be cheaper TLC host memory buffer (HMB) drives.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UGreen-CM850-with-sleeve-b.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UGreen-CM850-with-sleeve-b.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1560w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UGreen-CM850-with-sleeve-b.jpg?resize=300%2C132&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UGreen-CM850-with-sleeve-b.jpg?resize=768%2C337&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UGreen-CM850-with-sleeve-b.jpg?resize=1200%2C526&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UGreen-CM850-with-sleeve-b.jpg?resize=1536%2C673&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"526\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>The CM850 with it’s silicone  jacket in place.

These are all run on the PCWorld storage test bed’s Thunderbolt 4 ports, not a Mac. They’re still indicative of superior performance — given a superior NVMe SSD inside of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the CM850 is number one among all external SSDs tested on that platform, with the CM642 finishing a very close second. That said, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2289586/adata-se920-external-ssd-review.html\">Adata SE920</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2428449/owc-express-1m2-review.html\">OWC Express 1M2</a> are still both very fast drives that didn’t have the uber fast WD 8TB SN850X to help out.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/UGreen-CM850-CDM8-seq.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/UGreen-CM850-CDM8-seq.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2396w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/UGreen-CM850-CDM8-seq.jpg?resize=300%2C152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/UGreen-CM850-CDM8-seq.jpg?resize=768%2C388&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/UGreen-CM850-CDM8-seq.jpg?resize=1200%2C606&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/UGreen-CM850-CDM8-seq.jpg?resize=1536%2C776&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/UGreen-CM850-CDM8-seq.jpg?resize=2048%2C1034&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"606\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>The UGreen siblings give their pre-populated rivals more than a run for their money.

While performing the 450GB write in the PCWorld testing, the drive would disappear with the sleeve on. No doubt due to thermal issues, internal fan or no. Removing the silicone jacket allowed it to finish, as did running a fan over it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than that, I was absolutely delighted with the CM850’s performance. (Who other than PCWorld writes 450GB files on a regular basis?)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the Ugreen CM850?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The CM850 (or its pricier CM642 cousin) is an absolutely fantastic way to add 40Gbps storage to your Mac without paying that heavy Thunderbolt surtax. If you already have an NVMe SSD great, if you don’t, buy one and have at it. Good job, Ugreen.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"dfc80459437c66fd5b13572c11c5dee4b09ee01f543b1f5cb69716c715d39ba5","category":"Apple"}
