{"title":"Om Malik on the New iPad Mini","link":"https://om.co/2021/09/22/the-ipad-mini-2021-review/","date":1632440968000,"content":"\n<p>Om Malik:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The best way to extract the most out of the smallest iPad is to\nthink of it as a device enhanced by non-keyboard input methods — Scribble with Pencil, snapping photos with the cameras, or\nusing Siri/voice input. The improved “Scribble” allows you to\nmake notes, do quick searches, and even find directions. It is a\nvery addictive way to use the iPad, especially in the smaller\nsize. […]</p>\n\n<p>The more I use the device, the more I realize that most computing\nhas been defined by a singular idea of work and productivity.\nMobile devices have and will continue to redefine our work. In the\npast, most of the computing involved being in the office. Now,\nnon-office tasks have access to computing resources and thus offer\nan opportunity to make them more productive. Devices like the iPad\nare about making non-office work a bit more productive. Whether it\nis doctors, field engineers, or delivery drivers, devices such as\nthe iPad in general and iPad Mini, in particular, could help\nchange the very notion of productivity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What makes Om’s perspective interesting to me is that he switched to an iPad Pro as his main computer a few years back, and loves it. The iPad Mini isn’t an alternative to those sort of use cases — but as he points out, there are so many things people do with “computers” today that just weren’t imagined even a decade ago.</p>\n\n<p>I’m sort of the anti-Om in this regard. I have a 2018 iPad Pro that I generally keep in my kitchen, connected to a Magic Keyboard. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/the_ipad_magic_keyboard\">Ever since the Magic Keyboard came out</a> (with trackpad support and good keyboard shortcut support in iPadOS), I’ve found the iPad Pro <em>much</em> more useful for my work. But nowhere near as useful as a Mac. I’m not arguing that a MacBook is better than an iPad for work. I’m just saying MacOS works better for me. Not even close. Getting in the flow on my Mac, I feel 10 times more productive than I ever do on my iPad Pro. But the iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard is good enough that I now suspect it leads me to punt around in the kitchen drinking coffee <em>much</em> longer than I should at the start of my workdays. I like an iPad for reading the news at the start of the day, but I might be better served with a more limited iPad Mini than a significantly more useful iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard, just because it’d push me to get to my office and sit my ass in front of my real work machine.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/23/om-malik-ipad-mini\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"288c707675a1eb3520ee519bd0f6c10203967a051ad49959f4f6a17674e4bd2d","category":"Tech"}
