{"title":"Apple Held Talks With China Mobile to Bring Apple TV+ to China","link":"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-held-talks-with-china-mobile-to-bring-apple-tv-to-china?rc=jfy0lk","date":1717557646000,"content":"\n<p>Wayne Ma, reporting for The Information (paywalled, alas; <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/04/apple-tv-plus-china-streaming/\">9to5Mac has a summary</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple was in talks last year to launch its Apple TV+ video\nstreaming service in China via a deal with China Mobile, the\ncountry’s largest telecommunications provider, according to people\nwith knowledge of the matter. If successful, the talks would make\nApple TV+ the only U.S. streaming service to be available in\nChina, one of the world’s biggest markets. The status of the talks\nis unknown. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Under the terms of the deal being discussed last year, China\nMobile would offer Apple TV+ for a monthly fee and feature Apple’s\nvideo content prominently on Mobile HD, a set-top box that is\nincluded with China Mobile’s broadband service. Apple and China\nMobile would split revenue from Apple TV+ subscriptions, the\nperson said.</p>\n\n<p>Apple charges $9.99 for its video streaming service in the U.S.,\nbut it would likely have to charge less in China due to the weaker\npurchasing power of its consumers. For example, Apple Music costs\nonly $1.55 a month in China, compared with $10.99 in the U.S.\nVideo-streaming subscription services in China cost anywhere from\nbetween $3 to $5 a month on average.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ma focuses on the business implications of such a deal. My mind wonders about the content implications. Remember this report by Alex Kantrowitz and John Paczkowski for BuzzFeed News back in 2019, with the subhead “<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/apple-china-tv-protesters-hong-kong-tim-cook\">We thought trade would bring Western values to China. Instead, it brought Chinese values to Apple</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In early 2018 as development on Apple’s slate of exclusive Apple\nTV+ programming was underway, the company’s leadership gave\nguidance to the creators of some of those shows to avoid\nportraying China in a poor light, BuzzFeed News has learned.\nSources in position to know said the instruction was communicated\nby Eddy Cue, Apple’s SVP of internet software and services, and\nMorgan Wandell, its head of international content development. It\nwas part of Apple’s ongoing efforts to remain in China’s good\ngraces after a 2016 incident in which Beijing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/technology/apple-no-longer-immune-to-chinas-scrutiny-of-us-tech-firms.html\">shut down</a>\nApple’s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies six months after they\ndebuted in the country. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s tiptoeing around the Chinese government isn’t unusual in\nHollywood. It’s <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/top-gun-maverick-trailer-sparks-controversy-tom-cruise-jacket-1225993\">an accepted</a> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/richard-gere-hollywood-china\">practice</a>. “They all do\nit,” one showrunner who was not affiliated with Apple told\nBuzzFeed News. “They have to if they want to play in that market.\nAnd they <em>all</em> want to play in that market. Who wouldn’t?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wouldn’t. To hell with the money. The entire rest of the world is more than large enough. It’s a disgrace to have rules in place to avoid upsetting the thin-skinned tyrants who rule the largest totalitarian regime in the history of the world. How is it anything less than cowardice to forbid portraying China as the villains in a movie or show when the CCP is, in fact, villainous? <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2020/12/roman_a_clef_computer_maker\">Back in 2020 I wrote</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ben Thompson beat me to the punch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ditheringfm/status/1338502329297825794\">yesterday’s edition of\nDithering</a>, observing that a rule like this about Russia\nduring the Cold War would have blocked the entire James Bond\nfranchise from existing, not to mention just about any lesser spy\nmovies from the era. Or what of Stanley Kubrick’s <em>Dr.\nStrangelove</em>? Like the Soviet Union in the decades after WWII,\nChina is not some obscure small player on the world stage, and\nthey systematically do things that <em>deserve</em> to be portrayed “in a\npoor light”. To take China off the table is to take much of what’s\ngoing on geopolitically in the world today off the table.</p>\n\n<p>I get it, of course. I don’t agree with it, artistically or\nethically, but I get it: money talks, and China is where Apple\nassembles most of its products and a big market where it sells\nthem, too. But just because it’s so transparently obvious <em>why</em>\nApple would forbid any negative portrayals of China doesn’t make\nit any less outrageous. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Which studios or streaming services would bankroll today’s\nequivalent of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/10/satirzing-hitler-charlie-chaplin-great-dictator\">Charlie Chaplin’s classic <em>The Great\nDictator</em></a>, with Xi Jinping in Hitler’s place as the\ndeserving target of satiric mockery? Netflix — <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/netflix-has-a-china-strategy-it-doesnt-involve-launching-there-soon.html\">which doesn’t\noffer its service in China</a> and has no dependence on\ntheatrical box office revenue — <em>maybe</em>?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What’s next, removing the Taiwanese flag emoji from the keyboard for users in Hong Kong because <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/01/08/xi-the-pooh\">Winnie the Xi</a>’s feelings are hurt that Taiwan remains staunchly independent? Oh, wait, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/02/taiwan-flag-emoji\">that happened 5 years ago</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/04/apple-tv-plus-china\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5e99247a4ddc34df1c16594b700540dbe6d8ebc1c0a30056455dd50450283702","category":"Tech"}
