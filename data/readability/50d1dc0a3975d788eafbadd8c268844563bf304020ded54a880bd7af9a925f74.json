We hope you enjoy them.</p><p>In more ways than one, every entry is making a difference. Firstly, these images allow us to reflect on the past year and bring some light and joy into our world as we continue to battle the coronavirus pandemic. Secondly, just as in every year previously, the awards act as a fundraiser for cancer research. Entry fees go toward the Tour de Cure and help fund the Young Cyclists Assistance grant.</p><p>The competition closes on January 3, 2021, at which point our judges – Jojo Harper, Brazo de Hierro, and James Startt – will deliberate on who will take out the honors and prizes on offer from Wahoo. Winners will be announced on January 12, 2021.</p><h2>Professional category</h2><p>The professional category is open to all photographers that make a living from their work. They are competing for prestige and honor, along with the perpetual trophy and medallions.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AlexDuffill_01-1340x892.png\"><figcaption>“Taken near the end of the North Coast 500, Lawrence &amp; Ollie cross the Kylesku bridge after a morning of rain, hail and headwinds.” Alex Duffill @alexduffill</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Anna_VD_Breggan-1340x1787.png\"><figcaption>“Shot recently for Rouleur Magazine. Anna had recently retired from racing so we wanted to portray her as a woman moving into her new life after cycling.

Movistar and Quickstep were on the ramp. everything was low-key and I saw Mark Cavendish give the Movistar rider a helping hand.

Riding on the beach! And to make it even more exciting go out in the dark with some strong headlights! As part of an influencer ride from Bicycling Magazine (NL), we rode on the beach and had some fun getting our feet wet. Fun fact: in the Netherlands, we have beach races, actual racing on the beach on mountain bikes with big slick tires. Maybe one of the toughest cycling disciplines out there!

After Tom Boonen retired from professional cycling, he found a second sports career in racing cars in the Belcar and Dutch Supercar Challenge. In a recent interview Tom stated that he felt more nervous racing cars, and that winning in races felt more enjoyable than all his cycling victories. You can see the determination and focus in his eyes, just before the lights turn from red to green.” Marco Loman @lomanmarco</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PostRaceShower-1340x1072.png\"><figcaption>“Relief.
