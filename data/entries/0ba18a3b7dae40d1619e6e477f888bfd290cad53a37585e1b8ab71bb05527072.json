As we head into 2025, though, we're approaching something close to a critical mass of rumors and leaks suggesting that <em>Half-Life 3</em> is really in the works this time, and could be officially announced in the coming months.</p>\n<p>The latest tease came just before the end of 2024 via <a href=\"https://x.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922\">a New Year's Eve social media video</a> from <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788587/\">G-Man voice actor Mike Shapiro</a>. In the voice of the mysterious in-game bureaucrat, Shapiro expresses hopes that \"the next quarter century [will] deliver as many <em>unexpected surprises</em> as did the millennium's first (emphasis added)... See you in the new year.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Valve?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Valve</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Halflife?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Halflife</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GMan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GMan</a> #2025 <a href=\"https://t.co/mdT5hlxKJT\">pic.twitter.com/mdT5hlxKJT</a></p>\n<p>â€” Mike Shapiro (@mikeshapiroland) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The post is all the more notable because it's Shapiro's first in over four years, when he concluded a flurry of promotional posts surrounding the release of <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> (many of which were in-character as G-Man). And in 2020, just after <em>Alyx</em>'s release, Shapiro <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/mike-shapiro-voice-of-the-g-man-says-the-next-game-hes-in-will-be-like-seeing-an-old-friend-again\">told USGamer</a> that he had recently worked on a \"blast from the past\" project that he would \"announce... on my Twitter feed when I'm allowed to\" (no such announcement has been forthcoming for any other game).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/is-2025-finally-the-real-year-of-half-life-3-confirmed/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/is-2025-finally-the-real-year-of-half-life-3-confirmed/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0ba18a3b7dae40d1619e6e477f888bfd290cad53a37585e1b8ab71bb05527072","category":"Tech"}
