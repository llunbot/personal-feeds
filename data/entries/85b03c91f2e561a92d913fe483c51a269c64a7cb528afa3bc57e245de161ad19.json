User Leopeva64 on X, formerly Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Leopeva64/status/1773100165114499555\">posted screenshots</a> of an Edge build with a \"resource controls\" slider for manually limiting the browser's RAM usage. There's also a toggle to set whether you want RAM limits to kick in when you're playing a game, or if you want the limit to be enforced at all times.</p>\n<p>It builds on a feature that's already in the stable version of Edge, where the browser will alert you if an individual tab has particularly high memory usage. The minimum limit you can set for Edge appears to be 1GB, and it goes all the way up to the amount of physical memory you have installed in your PC.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014910#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014910&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"85b03c91f2e561a92d913fe483c51a269c64a7cb528afa3bc57e245de161ad19","category":"Tech"}
