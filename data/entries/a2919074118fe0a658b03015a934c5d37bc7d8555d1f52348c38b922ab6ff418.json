But one reliable analyst has predicted that next year, one iPhone’s screen will get smaller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ross Young, an analyst who specializes in the displays supply chain and has an <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://appletrack.com/ross-young/&amp;xcust=1-1-2309356-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">enviable track record</a>, this week released a report (via <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/17/iphone-17-plus-screen-size-rumor/&amp;xcust=1-1-2309356-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">9to5Mac</a>) in which he makes the startling claim that the iPhone 17 Plus will have a smaller screen than the 15 Plus (which is 6.7 inches) and 16 Plus (which is expected to be the same). He doesn’t name a specific measurement but says the 17 Plus will “sit in between” the smaller handsets–the 17 and 17 Pro–and the 17 Pro Max.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oddly enough, before we get to that point, Apple is expected to increase the screen sizes of two models later this year. Whereas the 15-series handsets line up like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>15: 6.1 inches</li>\n\n\n\n<li>15 Plus: 6.7 inches</li>\n\n\n\n<li>15 Pro: 6.1 inches</li>\n\n\n\n<li>15 Pro Max: 6.7 inches</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The 16-series handsets are expected to see size increases on the two Pro models:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>16: 6.1 inches</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16 Plus: 6.7 inches</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16 Pro: 6.3 inches</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16 Pro Max: 6.9 inches</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming the rest of the line holds steady, that means the 17 Plus will have a screen somewhere between 6.3 and 6.7 inches. This seems like an odd regression, but makes a certain sense. Apple has in recent years shown itself to be very keen on pushing customers toward the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1967034/apple-vision-pro-strap-upsell.html\">more expensive models</a>, and this would give the top-end 17 Pro Max yet another advantage over the cheaper 17 Plus. But it would be the first time an iPhone display got smaller after an update, even if we’re only talking about a couple of tenths of an inch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We only believe this rumor because Young generally is very reliable on display rumors. But even so, this is all a long way off. There’s still roughly five months to go until Apple launches the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16</a>, and plans can change. Watch this space for more developments.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a2919074118fe0a658b03015a934c5d37bc7d8555d1f52348c38b922ab6ff418","category":"Apple"}
