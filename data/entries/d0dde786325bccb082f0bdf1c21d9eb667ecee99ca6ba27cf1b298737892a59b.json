Today we’ve got one of the best ever: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Standard-Tilt-Adjustable/dp/B09V3GZD32?th=1\">The Apple Studio Display is down to $1,300 at Amazon</a>, a savings of $300 and just a few dollars away from its all-time low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">reviewed the Studio Display</a>, we loved its gorgeous design and the good image quality, as well as an impressive sound system with spatial audio, which isn’t something we find often in monitors. “There’s no question as to the quality of the Studio Display—it’s a great all-around display that’s well-suited for general use and production environments alike,” our review reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we truly appreciate Apple’s sleek designs, it’s the fact that this 27-inch monitor delivers 5K visuals that really captures our attention. That means images will be incredibly sharp and detailed, which makes this monitor perfect for work, creating images, video editing, and even gaming. The monitor also features a 12MP ultrawide camera with Center Stage so it will always keep the focus on you even if you move out of frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and get your own <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Standard-Tilt-Adjustable/dp/B09V3GZD32?th=1\">Apple Studio Display for $300 off at Amazon</a> while the deal’s still available.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Standard-Tilt-Adjustable/dp/B09V3GZD32?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d0dde786325bccb082f0bdf1c21d9eb667ecee99ca6ba27cf1b298737892a59b","category":"Apple"}
