Apple makes that possible, though it’s not a highlighted method, since it’s frequently the case that you will pay Apple for a service or for software.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>If you don’t have an Apple ID account or want to set up a fresh one</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672643/how-to-create-an-apple-id.html\">create an Apple ID</a> via the App Store in both iOS/iPadOS and macOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In iOS and iPadOS:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li> <span>If you have an existing Apple ID account you don’t want to use, log out: go to </span><em>Settings &gt; account name &gt; Media &amp; Purchases</em><span> and tap </span><em>Sign Out</em><span>.</span> </li>\n\n\n\n<li> <span>Launch the App Store.</span> </li>\n\n\n\n<li> <span>Find an app you can download at no cost. Such apps will have a Get button. Tap </span><em>Get</em><span>.</span> </li>\n\n\n\n<li> <span>The App Store prompts you for an Apple ID. Tap Create </span><em>New Apple ID</em><span>.</span> </li>\n\n\n\n<li> <span>When prompted for a payment method, select </span><em>None</em><span>.</span> </li>\n\n\n\n<li> <span>Follow the remaining steps to validate your account.</span> </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In macOS:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li> <span>Launch the App Store.</span> </li>\n\n\n\n<li> <span>If you have an existing Apple ID account you don’t want to use, choose </span><em>Store &gt; Sign Out</em><span>.</span> </li>\n\n\n\n<li> <span>Find an app you can download at no cost.
