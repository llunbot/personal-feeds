It's primarily used in AI servers today, and is often referred to as AI memory due to its ability to support AI processing alongside GPUs. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMobile HBM is what the term suggests â€“ a variant of the technology for mobile devices that is designed to deliver very high data throughput while minimizing power consumption and the physical footprint of the RAM dies. Apple is looking to enhance on-device AI capabilities, and <em>ETNews</em> reports that connecting mobile HBM to the iPhone's GPU units is  being considered as a strong candidate for achieving this goal.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe technology could be key for running massive AI models on-device, such as for large language model inference or advanced vision tasks, without draining battery or increasing latency.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report indicates that Apple may have already discussed its plans with major memory suppliers like Samsung Electronics and SK hynix, both of which are developing their own versions of mobile HBM.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung is reportedly using a packaging approach called VCS (Vertical Cu-post Stack), while SK hynix is working on a method called VFO (Vertical wire Fan-Out). Both companies aim for mass production sometime after 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs always though, there are manufacturing challenges. Mobile HBM is a lot more expensive to manufacture than current LPDDR memory. It could also face thermal constraints in slim devices like iPhones, and the 3D stacking and TSVs require highly sophisticated packaging and yield management.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf Apple does adopt this technology for its 2027 iPhone lineup, it would be yet another example of the company pushing the envelope for its 20th anniversary iPhone, which is rumored to feature a completely bezel-less display that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/20th-anniversary-iphone-no-visible-frame-bezels/\">curves around all four edges of the device</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/etnews-com/\">ETNews</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/2027-iphones-advanced-ai-memory-tech/\">Report: 2027 iPhones Could Adopt Advanced AI Memory Technology</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-2027-iphones-could-adopt-advanced-ai-memory-technology.2457050/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b596df19ba44b82139cef8659cac7e3efda914a245ce554fef28600e65c4c3d1","category":"Apple"}
