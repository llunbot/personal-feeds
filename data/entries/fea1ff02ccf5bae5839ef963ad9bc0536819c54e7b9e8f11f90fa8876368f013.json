One solution to the problem might look something like a new rearview mirror made by the automotive supplier Magna. At first glance, it looks like any other auto-dimming rearview mirror, but it cleverly incorporates a driver-monitoring system, or DMS. It solves a common problem with dash-mounted DMSes, and it's self-contained, so it's mounted in the same way a regular rearview mirror attaches to a car.</p>\n<p>Magna gave Ars a demo of the DMS on Wednesday as the company was visiting Washington, DC, for National Distracted Driving Month. That's an awareness thing, not a call to engage in more of it, although newly released crash statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show a national trend headed in the wrong direction. <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving\">More than 3,500 people were killed by distracted driving</a> in 2021, a 12 percent increase <a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813309#:~:text=In%202020%20there%20were%203%2C142,vehicle%20crashes%20involving%20distracted%20drivers.\">over the year before</a>.</p>\n<p>Distracted driving encompasses many things—eating, shaving, and applying makeup all count. But technology shoulders a large share of the blame. Between smartphones and infotainment systems, drivers are overloaded with information, and the consequences can be as gory as a <em>Max Headroom</em> episode.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934931#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934931&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
