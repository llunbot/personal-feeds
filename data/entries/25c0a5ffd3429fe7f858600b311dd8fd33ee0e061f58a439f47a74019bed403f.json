The original release of OS X Lion was available either as a digital download from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/\">Mac App Store</a> or via a USB thumb drive preloaded with the installer. Mountain Lion, on the other hand, was distributed exclusively as a downloadable product, delivered via an emailed redemption code.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's shift from physical to digital distribution became clear upon the release of OS X Lion in July 2011, marking the company's transition to online-only releases. Lion introduced features such as multi-touch gestures, Mission Control, and full-screen apps, but it also posed a challenge for users without access to the ‌Mac App Store‌. This was particularly true for those still running OS X Leopard, as they were unable to upgrade to Lion without first obtaining Snow Leopard or purchasing the Lion installer thumb drive.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOS X Mountain Lion, which debuted in July 2012, continued this trend. Mountain Lion was the last macOS version not initially offered for free. The digital-only approach was solidified with OS X Mavericks (version 10.9) in October 2013, establishing the ‌Mac App Store‌ as the sole avenue for obtaining new macOS versions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Apple ceased supporting both Lion and Mountain Lion some time ago, it continued to sell digital copies of these operating systems until now. Apple continues to offer <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/DL2077?locale=en_GB\">OS X Lion</a> and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/DL2076?locale=en_GB\">OS X Mountain Lion</a> as free digital downloads for those who still need them.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/apple-discontinues-the-last-macos-install-cds/\">Apple Removes OS X Lion and Mountain Lion From Online Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-removes-os-x-lion-and-mountain-lion-from-online-store.2411034/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"25c0a5ffd3429fe7f858600b311dd8fd33ee0e061f58a439f47a74019bed403f","category":"Apple"}
