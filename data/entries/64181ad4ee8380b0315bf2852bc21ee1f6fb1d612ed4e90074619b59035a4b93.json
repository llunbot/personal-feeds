The software maker will use the Recommended section of \nthe Start menu, which usually shows file recommendations, to \nsuggest apps from the Microsoft Store. </p>\n\n<p>“This will appear only for Windows Insiders in the Beta Channel in \nthe US and will not apply to commercial devices (devices managed \nby organizations),” says <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/04/12/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22635-3495-beta-channel/\">Microsoft in a blog post</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The app promotions can be disabled in the Settings section of \nWindows 11, but it appears that Microsoft will enable these by \ndefault. Microsoft is seeking feedback on the changes, so it’s \npossible the company could decide to ditch these ads in \ndevelopment builds of Windows 11 if there’s enough feedback that \nsuggests they’re not going to be a popular addition. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This feels more like a late (and unfunny) April Fools gag than a serious idea.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/12/msft-ads-start-menu\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"64181ad4ee8380b0315bf2852bc21ee1f6fb1d612ed4e90074619b59035a4b93","category":"Tech"}
