Most will come in September or October, but there could be a few surprises before then.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Apple-2025-Thumb-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe've rounded up a list of everything that we're still waiting to see from Apple in 2025.\r<br />\n<ol>\r<br />\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\"><strong>iPhone 17, 17 Air, and 17 Pro</strong></a> - We get new iPhones every September so it's not a surprise that updated models are coming, but this year should be exciting because the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">rumored iPhone 17 Air</a> will have an all-new ultra-thin form factor, plus the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max</a> are getting a new rear camera design.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 11</a></strong> - There's an updated Apple Watch coming, and it could get blood pressure monitoring and other health features, though that's not a guarantee yet.

There were some rumors about a new plastic casing, but that might be scrapped.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/\"><strong>AirPods Pro 3</strong></a> - It's finally time for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> to get an update, and it sounds like it'll be a big one. The ‌AirPods Pro‌ will have a new design, and the case could get an update too. We're expecting better audio quality, Active Noise Cancellation improvements, a faster chip, and possibly health features like temperature and heart rate monitoring.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a></strong> - The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a> is Apple's last Mac that doesn't have an M4 chip inside, and it's going to be refreshed before the end of the year.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></strong> - The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> was last updated in October 2024, but when October 2025 rolls around, it'll be due for another refresh. No major design changes are planned, but it will get a spec boost in the form of the faster M5 chip.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2024-apple-tv/\">Apple TV 4K</a></strong> - It's been quite some time since the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> was refreshed, and a new model is in the works. It'll have a faster processor, perhaps even one that can support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> and console-quality games. No design changes are expected.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></strong> - The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> could get its first update with a faster S-series chip, an Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip for improved performance, and new color options.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags-2/\">AirTag 2</a></strong> - There's a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTag</a> in the works, and it's slated for launch sometime in 2025.
