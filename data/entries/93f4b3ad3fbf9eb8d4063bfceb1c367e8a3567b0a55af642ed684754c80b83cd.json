Researchers can also use an AI agent to generate 3D physics simulations from text prompts.</p>\n<p>The accelerated simulation means a neural network for piloting robots can spend the virtual equivalent of decades learning to pick up objects, walk, or manipulate tools during just hours of real computer time.</p>\n<p>\"One hour of compute time gives a robot 10 years of training experience.
