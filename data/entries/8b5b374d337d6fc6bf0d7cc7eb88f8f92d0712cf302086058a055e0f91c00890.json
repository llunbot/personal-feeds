{"title":"Pymnts Survey: Only 6 Percent of People With iPhones Use Apple Pay In-Store","link":"https://www.pymnts.com/apple-pay-tracker/2021/7-years-later-6pct-people-with-iphones-in-us-use-apple-pay-in-store/","date":1631052981000,"content":"\n<p>Karen Webster, writing for the oddly-named Pymnts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Seven years post-launch, new PYMNTS data shows that 93.9% of\nconsumers with Apple Pay activated on their iPhones do not use it\nin-store to pay for purchases.</p>\n\n<p>That means only 6.1% do.</p>\n\n<p>That finding is based on PYMNTS’ national study of 3,671 U.S.\nconsumers conducted between Aug. 3-10, 2021. After seven years,\nApple Pay’s adoption and usage isn’t much larger than it was 2015\n(5.1%), a year after its launch, and is the same as it was in\n2019, the last full year before the pandemic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It doesn’t really make sense to me that adoption isn’t much higher than it was in 2015, and if these survey results are accurate, I find them surprisingly low. I’d have guessed somewhere in the 15–20 percent range. If it’s true adoption is this low, I think one factor could be first impressions — my wife got turned off by Apple Pay in the earlier years because so many retail terminals that supposedly accepted it were so finicky. Using an old-fashioned credit card was more reliable. Also, habits. But I use Apple Pay today whenever I can, and I find it <em>more</em> reliable than tap-and-pay with a physical card.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/pymnts-survey-apple-pay/\">Nick Heer, writing at Pixel Envy</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This survey shows an approximately flat use rate from 2019 through\n2021, down slightly from 2018. Webster writes that the pandemic\nought to have “changed the trajectory of Apple Pay” as\n“contactless and touchless have become the consumer’s checkout\nmantra”. But anyone with a Face ID-equipped iPhone can tell you\nthat wearing a mask requires you to authenticate by using your\npasscode, so it has been far easier for the past eighteen months\nto simply tap a card. That is probably true generally, as well;\nApple Pay may have better privacy and security, but it is no\neasier to use than a card that supports tap to pay, even without\nthe added complication of pandemic precautions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple Pay with Apple Watch works well while wearing a face mask, but using your iPhone sucks.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/07/apple-pay-usage\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8b5b374d337d6fc6bf0d7cc7eb88f8f92d0712cf302086058a055e0f91c00890","category":"Tech"}
