Their abilities to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20563906/\">recognize faces</a>, <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4803207/\">solve puzzles,</a> and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16801504/\">learn behaviors</a> from other octopuses make these animals a captivating study.</p>\n<p>To perform these processes and others, like crawling or exploring, octopuses rely on their complex nervous system, one that has become a focus for neuroscientists.
