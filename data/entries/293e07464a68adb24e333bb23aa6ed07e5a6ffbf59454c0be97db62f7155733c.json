Basically, every stat on this ebike gets big improvements over the already popular previous generation, as Specialized aims to build the ultimate enduro-ready all-mountain eMTB.

And forgive me for carrying on some of their super marketing speak. But the new Levo is clearly one of the best eMTBs on the market. Its only real downside, unsurprisingly, is the eye-watering pricetag. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can suspend your disbelief of the $13.5k price for a few minutes, it is interesting to dig into a lot of great new tech. With the Levo 4, Specialized managed to make a more powerful ebike that is also more controllable, has a natural riding feel (for the most part), and is quiet enough to not detract from your ride enjoying the great outdoors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Super Power</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-motor-mockup.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-motor-mockup.webp\" alt=\"2025 Specialized Levo 4 carbon all-mountain eMTB, new S-works motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-motor-mockup.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-motor-mockup-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-motor-mockup-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-motor-mockup-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-motor-mockup-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-motor-mockup-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-motor-mockup-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the core of the new 4th generation Levo is one of two all-new 3.1 series motors – both featuring class-leading power, smoother power delivery, and much quieter operation. And 27% more power than the gen 3 Levo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new S-Works-only motor now boasts 111Nm of torque and 720W peak power (a 27% increase over the previous Levo 3), while the standard model still puts out 101Nm and up to 666W of peak power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Battery options also go big. Most ebikes will come with a 840Wh internal battery, but there’s also a lighter 600Wh option if you want to go superlight. Add the 280Wh external range extender battery to boost either’s range. Or run the range extender only, and it transforms the new Levo into a light-assist eMTB to ride with friends on low-powered ebikes, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Super Natural Control</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_Blindurop-race-control.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_Blindurop-race-control.webp\" alt=\"2025 Specialized Levo 4 carbon all-mountain eMTB, Blinduro Elektro racing control\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_Blindurop-race-control.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_Blindurop-race-control-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_Blindurop-race-control-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_Blindurop-race-control-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_Blindurop-race-control-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_Blindurop-race-control-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_Blindurop-race-control-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But with more power comes more… need for control. And that’s where smarter firmware comes in. Specialized reworked power delivery to enable smoother transitions to all of that extra torque, repeatedly testing their control systems on loose climbs to dial it in perfectly. At the same time, the new motors do a better job of continuing to match &amp; boost your power, especially as your cadence increases. 60rpm was the sweet spot before, but now the gen 3.1 motors keep up the power to peak around 70rpm. But it now stays consistent all the way up to 120rpm, so you can keep spinning faster on those toughest climbs without worrying about upshifting and losing grip or support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Quieter Running</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-green-potting-inside.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-green-potting-inside.webp\" alt=\"2025 Specialized Levo 4 carbon all-mountain eMTB, green potting inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-green-potting-inside.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-green-potting-inside-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-green-potting-inside-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-green-potting-inside-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-green-potting-inside-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-green-potting-inside-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Specialized-Levo-4-carbon-all-mountain-eMTB_new-green-potting-inside-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More ‘super power’ and more ‘super natural’ smoothness are both great. But now, thanks to new hard diamond-like coatings to the steel gears inside, the meshing of the internal gears inside the new motors is quieter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, new ‘potting’ (an insulator material around the electric motor’s stators) means you get less of the wind-up noise of the motor as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add one more fact that the main motor bearing is now physically decoupled from the metal motor housing, and that noise simply doesn’t get amplified out of the motor. The result is a much quieter operation. We’ve ridden this thing next to the latest Shimano, Bosch &amp; Pinion ebikes and </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Genie Shock</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
