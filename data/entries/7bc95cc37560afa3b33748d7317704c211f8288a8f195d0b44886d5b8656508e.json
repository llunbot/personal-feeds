Racers will tackle several events back-to-back on various courses, including some new to Zwift. Qualifiers will be open to all Zwift riders, with the top finishers progressing to the finals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Epic Championship:</strong> This is the race for Zwift’s steeliest athletes, those who like to go long. This grueling race will be at least 60km long and test every facet of competitors’ resolve. The race will use Watopia’s new Coastal Causeway and a new route. An Epic community event will take place at the same time as the championship. Any Zwifter can participate in either event without a qualifier, creating what may be the world’s largest-ever cycling esports event! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Hill Climb Championship:</strong> Since it opened in 2018, the Alpe du Zwift has been a Zwift monument and right-of-passage. More than 600,000 Zwifters have navigated its 21 hairpin turns and scaled its heights. During the Zwift Games, the mountain goats of Zwift racing will have the chance to race from the bottom to the top. Definitively establish who is the best Cycling Esports climber. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Are you interested in participating in a group climb but not looking to race? </em>Join the community challenge, which will also feature the Alpe and other iconic Zwift climbs, which all have different levels of challenge.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about the Zwift Games and participation check out<a href=\"https://us.zwift.com/\"> Zwift.com</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/zwift-announces-zwift-games-cycling-esport-championship/\">Forget the UCI, Upcoming Zwift Games are Open to All Riders</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"7bc95cc37560afa3b33748d7317704c211f8288a8f195d0b44886d5b8656508e","category":"Cycling"}
