Predator is developed by Cytrox, a company that Citizen Lab <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/\">has said</a> is part of an alliance called Intellexa, “a marketing label for a range of mercenary surveillance vendors that emerged in 2019.” Other companies belonging to the consortium include Nexa Technologies (formerly Amesys), WiSpear/Passitora Ltd., and Senpai.</p>\n<p>Last year, researchers with Google’s Threat Analysis Group, which tracks cyberattacks carried out or funded by nation-states, reported that Predator had <a href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/protecting-android-users-from-0-day-attacks/\">bundled five separate zero-day exploits</a> in a single package and sold it to various government-backed actors. These buyers went on to use the package in three distinct campaigns. The researchers said Predator worked closely with a component known as Alien, which “lives inside multiple privileged processes and receives commands from Predator.” The commands included recording audio, adding digital certificates, and hiding apps.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942660#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942660&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"09f0a5e4b422bf4f19e7d18d93d437b37cca93ae40cbe92d35a5f7330497584a","category":"Tech"}
