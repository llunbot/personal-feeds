During an earnings call today, parent company Warner Bros. Discovery said that customers will start seeing \"very soft messaging\" about the upcoming change.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Max-Formerly-HBO-Max.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" />\r<br />\nAfter that initial message about password sharing, more strict rules will be put into place in 2025 and 2026. Warner Bros. Discovery CFO Gunnar Widenfels said that Max would be asking viewers who have \"not signed up, or multi-household members to pay a little bit more.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMax could also get a price increase in the future, and the company has not ruled out raising the cost of a subscription. Widenfels said that there is a \"fair amount of room to continue to push a price\" that Max has been \"judicious about.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMax has a total of 110.5 million subscribers globally, and the service is priced starting at $9.99 per month for an ad-supported version ($99.99 per year), or $16.99 per month for an ad-free version ($169.99 per year). There's also a more expensive \"Ultimate\" $20.99/month plan that provides 4K streaming.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStreaming services are putting an end to password sharing after Netflix <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/09/netflix-password-crackdown-subscriber-increase/\">successfully cracked down</a> on the practice last year. Netflix saw its subscription numbers increase after preventing customers from sharing accounts across multiple households.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hbo-max/\">HBO Max</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/max-password-sharing-crackdown/\">Max Planning to Crackdown on Password Sharing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/max-planning-to-crackdown-on-password-sharing.2442277/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6305abe2d763480d7e165b149d36cad11a7cefa091449cd110684afa8cdf6e9c","category":"Apple"}
