Apple has launched an internal study of products that are on the market, and is currently gathering feedback from Apple employees.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/Apple-Glasses-Triad-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn an email sent out to employees, Apple's Product Systems Quality team called for participants for \"an upcoming user study with current market smart glasses.\" According to Gurman, it is common for Apple to use focus groups when it is deciding on whether to enter a new market. Using employees for the focus groups allows Apple to keep its plans secret, something that wouldn't be possible with recruiting the public.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile a product is several years away, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/11/will-apple-ever-make-ar-smart-glasses/\">is mulling making smart glasses</a> that are similar to the Meta Ray-Bans. Meta's glasses have a camera and integrated AI so that users can ask questions about what's around them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple could potentially design a simple set of glasses with a camera, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> integration, and built-in speakers for listening to music, plus there could be included health capabilities. The glasses would essentially be an upgraded version of the AirPods with additional capabilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSmart glasses that integrate just a camera, speakers, and AI would be easy for Apple to produce, and it could be a way to boost wearable profits while work continues on augmented reality glasses. Apple has not been able to make AR glasses due to high costs and technical limitations that the company has not yet been able to overcome.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGathering feedback from employees about Meta's glasses and other similar devices could provide Apple with valuable information on what features customers prefer.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/apple-smart-glasses-employee-survey/\">Apple's Internal Survey About Smart Glasses Hints at Future Product Plans</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-internal-survey-about-smart-glasses-hints-at-future-product-plans.2442007/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8e3a8a89dd18006b456c77d059fd53cfd872a1d083fb08c1dfc9c919aea7e72d","category":"Apple"}
