Content on offer includes disturbing imagery of children self-harming, \"incest toddlers,\" and minors performing sex acts with animals, as well as opportunities for buyers to arrange illicit meetups with children, the Journal reported.</p>\n<p>Because the child sexual abuse material (CSAM) itself is not hosted on Instagram, platform-owner Meta has a harder time detecting and removing these users. Researchers found that even when Meta's trust and safety team does ban users, their efforts are \"directly undercut\" by Instagram's recommendation system—which allows the networks to quickly reassemble under \"backup\" accounts that are usually listed in the bios of original accounts for just that purpose of surviving bans.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946320#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946320&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b3562ed1009423ba94881377a7176530c9ded852a484a3f5d7f565d7fad0823c","category":"Tech"}
