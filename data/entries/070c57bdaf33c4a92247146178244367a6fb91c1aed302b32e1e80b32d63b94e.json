The macOS Sonoma 14.4, watchOS 10.4, tvOS 17.4, and visionOS 1.1 updates are all available now, and most of them add at least one or two major features as they fix multiple bugs and patch security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>The visionOS 1.1 release is the first major update for Apple's newest operating system, and as our coverage of the headset has demonstrated, there's still plenty of low-hanging fruit to fix. Most notably for people <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/i-worked-exclusively-in-vision-pro-for-a-week-heres-how-it-went/\">who are trying to use the headset for work meetings</a>, Apple says that there have been multiple changes to the look of Personas, the 3D avatars that show up in your place when you're video chatting with the Vision Pro on your face. The update improves \"hair and makeup appearance,\" \"neck and mouth representation,\" and \"rendering of the eyes,\" and while it's clear that it's an improvement over the 1.0 release of Personas, the core uncanniness still seems to be intact. The Persona feature is still labeled as a beta.</p>\n\n<p>Apple has also made tweaks to the appearance and functionality of the headset's virtual keyboard, improved the Virtual Display feature's Mac connectivity, and added a handful of mobile device management features for IT administrators.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008833#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008833&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"070c57bdaf33c4a92247146178244367a6fb91c1aed302b32e1e80b32d63b94e","category":"Tech"}
