{"title":"Jony Ive on ‘Desert Island Discs’","link":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m00289vf","date":1740589164000,"content":"\n<p>Desert Island Discs is a BBC audio interview program hosted (or <em>presented</em>, if you will) by Lauren Laverne. The gimmick is that guests are asked to name eight songs, a book, and a “luxury item” they’d take with them if stranded on a desert island, and those picks — including playing the songs — are sprinkled throughout the interview. This week’s guest is Jony Ive, and it’s one of the best interviews with him I’ve ever encountered. Incredibly thoughtful and inspiring, and Laverne covers a lot of ground without ever seeming the least bit hurried.</p>\n\n<p>A few highlights, from Ive:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think that one of the struggles I have, though, is in some ways,\nI think ironically, I struggle with being present in the now\nbecause I spend so much of my life in my head in the future. The\nway I try to understand the future is I’m obsessed with the past.\nAnd so the bit that often gets missed out is right now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know that feeling.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding his early years at Apple, before the reunification with NeXT and the return of Steve Jobs, Ive spoke about the company’s severe financial troubles skewing how it thought about products:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think when you struggle, then a goal can become just commercial\nissues. I understand — I mean, if you’re losing lots of money,\nyou’d like to stop losing lots of money. The problem there is it\nmeans you focus on money, and you’re normally losing money because\nthe products aren’t right. And from ‘92 to ‘97, it was a very,\nvery difficult season. One that I am so grateful for — but I\nstill get the shivers sometimes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The telling word Ive used in that passage is “right”. He could have said the problem was that Apple’s mid-’90s products weren’t “good”, but he didn’t. Judging them as good or bad isn’t the correct framework. It’s that they weren’t <em>right</em>. There’s an inherent subjectiveness to rightness. A <em>je ne sais quoi</em>. The original iMac that started Ive’s long and remarkably fruitful collaboration with Steve Jobs wasn’t a hit because it was good, so much as because it was so obviously <em>right</em>.</p>\n\n<p>(The BBC’s <a href=\"https://podcasts.files.bbci.co.uk/b006qnmr.rss\">podcast feed for Desert Island Discs</a> seems to run about a month behind the website, alas.
