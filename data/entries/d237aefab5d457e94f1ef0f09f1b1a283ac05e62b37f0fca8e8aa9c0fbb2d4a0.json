On Wednesday, the lab will lay 325 employees off, representing about 5 percent of the workforce at the California-based laboratory that leads the development of robotic space probes for NASA.</p>\n<p>\"This is a message I had hoped not to have to write,\" JPL Director Laurie Leshin said in a memo to staff members on Tuesday morning, local time. \"Despite this being incredibly difficult for our community, this number is lower than projected a few months ago thanks in part to the hard work of so many people across JPL.\"</p>\n<p>The cuts this week follow a reduction of 530 employees in February of this year due to various factors, including a pause in funding for the Mars Sample Return mission. The NASA laboratory has now cut about one-eighth of its workforce this year.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/for-the-second-time-this-year-nasas-jpl-center-cuts-its-workforce/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/for-the-second-time-this-year-nasas-jpl-center-cuts-its-workforce/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d237aefab5d457e94f1ef0f09f1b1a283ac05e62b37f0fca8e8aa9c0fbb2d4a0","category":"Tech"}
