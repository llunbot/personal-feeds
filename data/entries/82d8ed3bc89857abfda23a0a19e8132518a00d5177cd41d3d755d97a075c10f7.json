With the advent of SRAM developing direct-mount gravel race Transmission setups in addition to the mullet MTB adventure gravel drivetrains, Titici decided to add more than a UDH to their carbon gravel race bike…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Titici Relli Pro upgrades Italian carbon gravel race bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_front-end-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_front-end-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Titici Relli Pro lightweight custom Italian carbon gravel race bike, headtube detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_front-end-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_front-end-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_front-end-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_front-end-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_front-end-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Titici)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It started with a project to update the Relli for UDH compatibility, together in collaboration with feedback from Titici’s Sartoria Ciclistica gravel team. And in the end, it just gave Titici a good excuse to revisit the carbon gravel race bike they’d introduced only <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/titici-relli-carbon-gravel-bike-adds-arch-absorber-to-ultra-thin-toptube-flexy-comfort-concept/\" target=\"_blank\">two years ago</a>. Their core concept of the engineered flex remains, both in the iconic Titici patented Plate Absorber Tech (PAT) ultra-thin toptube and the vibration-damping Arch Absorber Tech (AAT) curved seattube. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_UDH-Transmission-upgrade-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_UDH-Transmission-upgrade-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Titici Relli Pro lightweight custom Italian carbon gravel race bike, UDH with direct mount SRAM Transmission derailleur\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_UDH-Transmission-upgrade-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_UDH-Transmission-upgrade-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_UDH-Transmission-upgrade-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_UDH-Transmission-upgrade-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_UDH-Transmission-upgrade-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_UDH-Transmission-upgrade-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_UDH-Transmission-upgrade-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time as redesigning the dropouts to fit a Universal Derailleur Hanger (UDH), Titici also completely reshaped the rear end of the Relli Pro. The new design drops the seatstays a bit further down the seattube for more rider comfort flex. And they were able to eliminate any seatstay bridge, incrementally shedding weight off the frame “without compromising rigidity and stiffness”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_revised-seat-cluster-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_revised-seat-cluster-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Titici Relli Pro lightweight custom Italian carbon gravel race bike, seat cluster\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_revised-seat-cluster-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_revised-seat-cluster-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_revised-seat-cluster-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_revised-seat-cluster-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_revised-seat-cluster-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new gravel bike also now drops its chainstays directly from the bottom bracket, transitioning back to the dropout in a straighter line. Together with carbon revisions in the AAT arch at the bottom of the seattube, this new Relli Pro is now able to be run with a double crankset. Titici engineers reworked the lower seattube’s construction so a removable hanger can be bolted to the back of the arch to mount a front derailleur for gravel racers who prefer the tight gear ratios of a 2x drivetrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_headtube-detail-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_headtube-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Titici Relli Pro lightweight custom Italian carbon gravel race bike, detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_headtube-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_headtube-detail-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_headtube-detail-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_headtube-detail-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_headtube-detail-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_headtube-detail-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A subtle bump up in tire clearance, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Relli had originally maxed out at 42mm tires since most racers were running 40s.

And then, Titici builds each bike to order whether you choose stock or custom geometry, with a delivery lead time estimate of 12 weeks. Framesets Relli Pro gravel framesets start at 4990€, and it looks like custom geometry does not necessarily add any extra cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several complete gravel bike builds are available. Titici gravel race setups start off at 6990€, either with a lightweight Campagnolo Ekar 13-speed or a wireless electronic SRAM Rival XPLR AXS 12-speed groupset. A Force XPLR AXS build adds a thousand euros to 7990€. And either 1x Force or Rival AXS can get upgraded to a virtual 2x setup with a Classified Powershift system built into the rear wheel for an extra 2000€.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Red-build-detail-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Red-build-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Titici Relli Pro lightweight custom Italian carbon gravel race bike, SRAM Red cockpit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Red-build-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Red-build-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Red-build-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Red-build-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Red-build-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Red-build-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Titici-Relli-Pro-custom-Italian-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Red-build-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly, a SRAM Red XPLR AXS13-speed build tops out the Titici Relli Pro gravel race bike build options at 10,490€.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Titici-gravel-bike-riding-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"950\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Titici-gravel-bike-riding-jpg.webp\" alt=\"titici riding gravel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Titici-gravel-bike-riding-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Titici-gravel-bike-riding-297x157.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Titici-gravel-bike-riding-1536x811.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Titici-gravel-bike-riding-120x63.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Titici-gravel-bike-riding-768x405.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.titici.com/product/relli-pro/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Titici.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/titici-relli-pro-carbon-gravel-bike-gets-lighter-with-engineered-flex-1x-or-2x-udh/\">Titici Relli Pro Carbon Gravel Bike Gets Lighter With Engineered Flex, 1x or 2x &amp; UDH</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"82d8ed3bc89857abfda23a0a19e8132518a00d5177cd41d3d755d97a075c10f7","category":"Cycling"}
