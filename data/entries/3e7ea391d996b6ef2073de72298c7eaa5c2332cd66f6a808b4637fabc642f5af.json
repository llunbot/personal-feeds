Spotify hasn't responded to pleas to salvage the hardware, which was originally intended to connect to car dashboards and auxiliary outlets to enable drivers to listen to and navigate Spotify.</p>\n<p>Spotify announced today that it's bricking all purchased Car Things on December 9 and not offering refunds or trade-in options. On a <a href=\"https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/\">support page</a>, Spotify says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We're discontinuing Car Thing as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our product offerings. We understand it may be disappointing, but this decision allows us to focus on developing new features and enhancements that will ultimately provide a better experience to all Spotify users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Spotify has no further guidance for device owners beyond asking them to reset the device to factory settings and “safely” get rid of the bricked gadget by “following local electronic waste guidelines.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026806#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026806&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3e7ea391d996b6ef2073de72298c7eaa5c2332cd66f6a808b4637fabc642f5af","category":"Tech"}
