And so\nFossil’s 2021 smartwatch lineup is running software that hasn’t\nbeen meaningfully improved since at least 2019 and it won’t\nreceive the latest software until late 2022. Samsung has\nsmartwatches that run on Wear OS 3 and do so competently, Fossil\nis stuck on Wear OS 2.</p>\n\n<p>Running old software is not inherently a bad thing — old software\nis often battle tested, reliable, and fast. Sadly, none of those\nadjectives apply here and Fossil compounded Wear OS 2’s issues by\ncramming in features it’s unable to support.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maybe in the long run, hitting the reset button on Wear OS will prove to be a solid strategy. But in the meantime, it’s rather astonishing how Apple is just running away with the smartwatch market.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/15/bohn-fossil-gen-6\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b3327bbf96023672ededa77608e014d7b2dcf5eff68186f2311fd4ce4767816d","category":"Tech"}
