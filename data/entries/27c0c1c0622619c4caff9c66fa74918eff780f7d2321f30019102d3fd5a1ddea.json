Apple will give its employees at least a monthâ€™s warning before mandating a return to offices, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing internal policy.</blockquote>After over a year of remote work, many employees at not only Apple but many other companies have expressed interest in continuing their remote work arrangements, seeking increased flexibility and in some cases an escape from high housing prices near many corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley and beyond.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile some companies have embraced the move, Apple has so far attempted to take a hybrid approach, arguing that in-person collaboration is essential to the company's culture and future. So while Apple may have delayed its plans to return to at least some in-person work for most employees, it remains to be seen how things will shake out over the long term.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/apple-delays-return-to-offices/\">Apple Will Delay Bringing Employees Back to Offices Until at Least October</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-will-delay-bringing-employees-back-to-offices-until-at-least-october.2304816/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_TRqlv4Ahqk:lkJAC0yc4eY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_TRqlv4Ahqk:lkJAC0yc4eY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/_TRqlv4Ahqk\" />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"27c0c1c0622619c4caff9c66fa74918eff780f7d2321f30019102d3fd5a1ddea","category":"Apple"}
