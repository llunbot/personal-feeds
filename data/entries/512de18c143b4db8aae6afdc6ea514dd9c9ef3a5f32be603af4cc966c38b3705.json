By quantifying this effect, our work highlights the unrecognized potential for tea consumption to passively contribute to reduced heavy metal exposure in populations worldwide.”</p>\n<p>Some 2 billion people drink tea on a daily basis worldwide, and numerous studies have suggested various health benefits from regular tea consumption. Most nutrition studies focus on things like polyphenols, caffeine, or other chemicals released during brewing, but such research overlooks a unique aspect of tea: unlike most food and drink, tea leaves are not directly consumed, and the brewing process allows tea leaves to adsorb chemicals as well as release them—most notably heavy metal toxins like lead, arsenic, or cadmium. (Adsorption is when a substance adheres to the surface of something; absorption is when a material takes in a substance.)</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/brewing-tea-removes-lead-from-water/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/brewing-tea-removes-lead-from-water/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"512de18c143b4db8aae6afdc6ea514dd9c9ef3a5f32be603af4cc966c38b3705","category":"Tech"}
