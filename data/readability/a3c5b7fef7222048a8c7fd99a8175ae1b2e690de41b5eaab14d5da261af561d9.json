Commuter bike styles vary widely, from step-through frames and full-fender bikes to ultra-simple fixed gears.</p><p>This list is by no means exhaustive—there are thousands of bike models that fall into the “commuter” category if you broaden the definition. Here, we’ve rounded up the models that have been tested and found to perform consistently, are worth the price tag, and have a little something extra to recommend them…</p><p><a

This bare-bones hybrid bike is simple and at a glance, doesn’t look like anything fancy. But for a commuter bike that’ll be locked outside all day, that’s a plus…it won’t attract attention. And the lightweight, shaped, and butted aluminum frame will stand up to the elements (though it does have a steel fork on this model).</p><p>What we like about the Sirrus is that it <em>could</em> get you to work at a leisurely pace, but can also haul ass when you’re running late for a meeting.&nbsp;We appreciate that comfortable cruising but sporty handling combination. Use the rack and fender mounts to add more capability as needed.</p><p>The 1×8 wide-range MicroSHIFT Advent drivetrain is surprisingly good and keeps things really simple, yet with enough gear range to scoot up the climbs and hammer the flats. Wider, mildly aggressive tires make this a great fitness bike for groomed bike trails and riders who enjoy taking those secret dirt shortcuts now and then.</p><ul><li>Type: Hybrid</li><li>Drivetrain: MicroSHIFT 8-Speed</li><li>Brakes: Promax F1 hydraulic disc</li><li>Weight:&nbsp; 27.3 pounds</li><li>Sizes: XS-XL</li><li>Color: Black, Dove Gray, Dusty Coral, Gloss Clay</li><li>Extras: N/A</li><li>Price: $775</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Great balance of budget and performance<br><strong>CONS</strong>: No fenders or other extras<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;<strong>BEST BUDGET:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=764e2174-9fd2-4c8f-bf04-2215d1ac6793&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgear.com%2Fcollections%2Fstate-bicycle-co%3F_%3Dpf%26pf_p_price%3D299.99%3A299.99\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State Bicycle Co.

If you’re looking for an entry to singlespeed riding for getting around a flat-ish area, it’s hard to beat these $300 4130 chromoly (steel alloy) bikes.</p><p>The bike comes with a flip-flop hub, meaning it can convert from singlespeed, where the caliper brakes become necessary to stop but coasting is possible, to fixed gear where you slow down by slowing your pedaling. This style of bike is a bike messenger staple because of its simplicity: No gears or shifters to deal with, and when using the fixed gear side of the hub, even braking is simplified.

But at the time, we didn’t know what the future would hold—and the ability to take a bike on a cruise ship (and manage to not get grease on any of the sheets in a small cabin) was a good test of how the Oyama Skyline in7B would work in an office or dorm room setting.</p><p>Equipped with an internally geared 7-speed Shimano Nexus hub and Belt drive, our editor found that it had a reasonably good gear range for tackling rolling hills or headwinds. The Belt drive was a major bonus: no exposed gears, chain, or grease means easy storage whether on a cruise ship, cubicle, dorm, apartment, subway, or bus.</p><p>It has a lightweight alloy frame, and it comes with fenders and a rear rack with integrated bungee strap, and the folding process was a literal snap.

It even uses a Shimano dynamo front hub to power your lights.</p><p>This editor admittedly struggled on the first ride: Unlike a repurposed road bike, MTB or fixed gear, this bike is built for comfort, not speed. Running late? You won’t be able to put much extra power down. But if you’re riding with the intention of not getting sweaty in your work clothes, or you’re just enjoying a casual ride, this bike is perfect.</p><p>After the initial adjustment—and a rainy ride—it was clear that the internal hub, the full fenders, and the pedal-powered front and rear lights are perfect for a commute. Even on a muddy day on the bike trail heading downtown, there was no mud spray, and the Gates CDX drive meant no need to clean a chain.</p><p>Also worth noting: This bike is burly.

Want to do a road ride after work? Gravel on the weekends? A swap of the handlebars (to something like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/07/16/the-surly-corner-bar-is-now-serving-mtb-dropbar-positions-without-changing-components/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Surly Corner Bar</a>) and change of tires can morph this bike into a gravel grinder, a decent road bike, or a decent cyclocross build. This editor raced a Cross Check on the cyclocross course for years, even in the elite field, and loved it.</p><p>Of course, the versatility means that it’s not the perfect commuter. It doesn’t include any bells and whistles, though it does have eyelets to easily mount racks and fenders if you want to make it more weatherproof. At $949, we can forgive the fact that it doesn’t have disc brakes—though that does mean it’s less ideal for cyclocross racing than it would have been 10 years ago. That said, these bikes are pretty bombproof: That cyclocross-racing this editor did? That was 15 years ago, when the bike had already been passed through several racers. It’s still being passed around a junior team in New Jersey to this day.</p><p>Last thing worth noting: It comes in sizes ranging from 42 to 64cm, a huge spread. It’s rare to find road-ish bikes available under 50cm, so this is a great option for many women, kids, and shorter men.</p><ul><li>Type: Road/Cyclocross</li><li>Drivetrain: Microshift Acolyte

The bike is ready for racks and fenders if you want to add them, and features a unique geometry with a sloping top tube that will actually make it easier to wear work clothing while riding.</p><p>This bike has mechanical disc brakes, a huge upgrade from the Cross Check’s rim brakes. Choose between flat or dropped handlebars, and 1x or 2x drivetrains. And opt for 700cc or 650b wheels, depending on whether you want to run road or mountain bike tires. The standard model comes with dropped bars and 700c wheels, though.</p><ul><li>Type: Road/Bikepacking</li><li>Drivetrain: Shimano Sora</li><li>Brakes: Promax Disc</li><li>Wheels: Formula with WTB Riddler tires</li><li>Weight: 24.6lbs for 55.5cm</li><li>Sizes: 50, 52, 54, 55.5, 57, 59.5cm</li><li>Color: White</li><li>Extras: None</li><li>Price: $1199</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Great price for a versatile, adventure-ready bike<br><strong>CONS</strong>: None, really<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;<strong>BEST RETRO FLAIR:</strong> <a href=\"https://bombtrack.com/2021-arise-tour/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bombtrack Arise Tour&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike.jpeg\" alt=\"Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_ best commuter bike\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike.jpeg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-297x198.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-800x533.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-120x80.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-768x512.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-696x464.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-1068x712.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-630x420.jpeg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb26 src ng ngcb26 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike.jpeg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-297x198.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-800x533.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-120x80.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-768x512.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-696x464.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-1068x712.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153230/Bombtrack_Arise_Tour_-best-commuter-bike-630x420.jpeg 630w\"></a></p><p>We love a bike that looks like it requires riders to sport a handlebar mustache and three-piece suit to ride it, but that is fully equipped with all the latest and greatest in bike tech. Enter the Bombtrack Arise Tour, a 4130 Chromoly-tubed navy bike with tanned leather accents that looks antique but definitely isn’t.</p><p>The bike is designed for light touring or heavy-duty commuting, with plenty of rack space to store your work supplies. This is ideal if you’re planning commuting on hot days, since you’ll avoid a sweaty back from a backpack. Or pack your clothes and change at work. Either way, you won’t have to shoulder your books, laptop, etc…just put them in a pannier bag.</p><p>The pre-mounted lights are powered by a dynamo hub, so you don’t need to worry about plugging anything in. And of course, full fenders keep you dry on rainy days.

But don’t just go on looks alone: Here’s what to think about as you pick the bike that’s right for you.</p><p><strong>Style</strong>. We dig into this more in the FAQ section below, but clearly, there is a huge range of options in terms of commuter bike style. Rather than just picking the one that looks the coolest to you, consider the distance and climbing profile of your commute. If you have a three-mile flat route, a singlespeed might be your lowest cost/lowest maintenance perfect choice. However, if you have a 10-mile hilly route to work, something geared is going to be crucial for most riders.</p><p><strong>Price</strong>. Obviously, bikes aren’t cheap. Though comparatively, commuter bikes are in the cheaper category compared to road, MTB, or gravel bikes! Still, you can see from this list that prices can range from a few hundred dollars to nearly two thousand, depending on the style and components. For some, price may be no object. For those on a budget, consider choosing a bike with less frills—like a single speed—that has a low price tag, rather than opting for a bargain bike from a big box store – it might come with all the bells and whistles, but it’ll likely break down faster in the long run and cost you more to maintain.</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>. Are you going to need to heft the bike up five flights of stairs to bring it into the office? If so, weight might be a factor. But if you’re rolling from your garage into the first-floor bike parking at your building, the weight may be less of an issue.</p><p><strong>Components</strong>. Look at the spec list and try to find the best price/value compromise, usually somewhere in the middle of the range. You’ll have fewer breakdowns and maintenance issues if you can spend a bit more on the components, but rarely do commuter bikes require the latest/greatest/lightest options.</p><p><strong>Extras</strong>. Consider what extras come with the bike, and what extras you’ll need to buy to add to it. (This can factor in when considering the price.) Some bikes come with built-in lights (and Trek &amp; Bombtrack’s bikes even have a hub that powers them!). Some bikes have full fenders—important for if you’re riding to work or school rain or shine. Others are pretty bare-bones, but that might be good if you’d prefer to pick your own add-ons, or already have lights/fenders/racks.</p><figure id=\"attachment_261877\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-261877\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb26 src ng ngcb26 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/14151049/best-bike-storage-13-265x198.jpg 265w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-261877\">Do you have a place to store your bike easily?</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Storage.</strong> Do you have space to stash another bike at home? Some bikes—fixed gears and folding bikes—take up minimal space, while burlier hybrids and commuters can take up a huge amount of room. At work, will you be able to keep your bike inside somewhere (in your office or a storage area) or will it be locked outside? If it’s locked outside, consider the area you’re in. A burly lock can deter bike thieves, but if bike theft is a major issue near you, a less expensive bike (plus a good lock and bike insurance) might be a smarter option.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions about Commuter Bikes</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb26 src ng ngcb26 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26153254/IMG_3628-best-commuter-bike-265x198.jpg 265w\"></a></p><p><strong>What is a commuter bike?</strong><br>There are a few bikes that can be considered part of the commuter bike category, which is why the options above look so different and vary so much.</p><ul><li>Hybrid: Most traditional commuter bikes based on a more Euro style are hybrid bikes. They typically have step-through or lower frames for ease of straddling the bike in dress pants or a skirt, a wider saddle for short ride comfort, higher handlebars so you’re sitting more upright, and thicker, puncture-resistant city tires.</li><li>Singlespeed/fixed gear: The commuter bike of choice for bike messengers (and, in the early aughts, hipsters). They’re great commuters because they have so few components to take care of, they’re lightweight, and in cities, they’re great options for shorter, flatter commutes.</li><li>Folding bike: A folding bike is a hybrid commuter’s best friend. For hybrid commuters, part of the journey happens on a bus, train or car, then you hop on a bike for the second part. A folding bike is often the only kind of bike allowed on trains or subways during peak hours, and it’s great because you can bring it into the office with you.</li><li>Drop bar bike: These look like a road bike, but usually have mounts for racks and fenders. The handlebars are usually flared outward a bit. The tires won’t be quite as thick as on a Hybrid, but they’ll be lighter and faster. These are great bikes for riders who want to ditch the gear and explore on weekends or ride gravel and need one bike to do it all.</li></ul><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03.jpg\" alt=\"can you fit an oyama folding bicycle behind the seats in a minivan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03.jpg 1000w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb26 src ng ngcb26 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03.jpg 1000w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oyama-skyline-belt-drive-folding-bike-review-03-265x198.jpg 265w\"></a></p><p><strong>Do I need a commuter bike?</strong><br>Honestly, no. Many people opt to simply use their current bike, an old bike that they no longer use for fun riding but still functions, or they’ll buy a cheap used bike to ride around town. This editor used her mountain bike from when she was 13 as her commuter bike until very recently. These older bikes are often great because you’re less worried about bike theft when locking a 19-year-old bike outside. Plus, you know all of its quirks, like the fact that it gets stuck between gears when pedaling on any incline. Alternatively, you may just use your current road, mountain, gravel, or cyclocross bike as your commuter. That’s completely allowed.</p><p><strong>What kind of commuter hybrid bike frames are there?</strong><br>There are two main types of frames that commuter bikes are designed with: a step-through and a more standard double-triangle road-style frame. Some bikes will fall somewhere between a step-through style and a road style frame, with a sloped top tube to allow for easier on/off access while wearing work clothes.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0.jpg\" alt=\"2022 Trek District 4 commuter bike with belt drive fenders and hub powered lights\" width=\"1377\" height=\"916\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0.jpg 1377w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0-800x532.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0-768x511.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0-696x463.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0-1068x710.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0-631x420.jpg 631w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1377px) 100vw, 1377px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb26 src ng ngcb26 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0.jpg 1377w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0-800x532.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0-768x511.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0-696x463.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0-1068x710.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10120649/2022-trek-district-4-equipped-belt-drive-commuter-bike-0-631x420.jpg 631w\"></a></p><p><strong>What kind of bike do I need for a commute?</strong><br>While this list is made up of bikes technically designed for commuting, another style of bike might suit different types of riders. Think about your average day and what would be the easiest for you.</p><p>For instance, commuters who ride the train or bus for part of their commute before pedaling the final stretch may prefer a folding bike that can be stored under a seat. For longer commutes, a road bike (and a full change of clothing at the office) might be faster and more efficient.</p><p>Alternatively, for longer commutes or for riders who need a bit of a boost, an e-bike might be ideal…just remember that they’re a <em>lot</em> heavier and really hard to lug up stairs. And if you live in a small apartment or you’re on a tight budget, your best option for a commuter bike might simply be whatever type of bike you prefer to ride when you’re riding for fun. Don’t feel like you’re locked into a strictly “commuter” option, consider your needs and how you prefer to ride.</p><figure id=\"attachment_266507\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266507\"><a

best locks for every type of rider)</li><li>Fenders, either a simple clip-on rear fender to avoid the worst splatter on wet days, or a full permanent set on the front and rear</li><li>Extra tube, mini-pump, tire levers, multitool (and any tools required to remove wheels if needed—some bikes will require a wrench to remove the wheel)</li><li>Front and rear lights, for both rainy days and late nights at the office…though we recommend using flashing front and rear lights at all times to improve your visibility to drivers. Some bikes we list have integrated lights that charge through the bike’s hub.
