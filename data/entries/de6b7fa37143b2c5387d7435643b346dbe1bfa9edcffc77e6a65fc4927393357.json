The law applies to any individual iPhone unit placed for sale after the deadline, even if they are older models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrench website <em>iGeneration</em> last week reported that the iPhone SE, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/13/iphone-14-and-iphone-se-eu-report/\">would no longer be sold</a> through Apple's online store and retail stores in EU countries starting December 28, which is when the regulation goes into force. However, the report said sales of the iPhones would be halted on Apple's online store in Switzerland around one week earlier, and that has now happened. The report said in-store availability at Apple's retail locations in Switzerland will continue until December 28.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven that the Switzerland aspect of the report has now proven to be accurate, it is likely next week that Apple will make the affected iPhones unavailable across all 27 countries in the EU, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and others. While the United Kingdom left the EU in 2020, Northern Ireland continues to participate in the single EU market.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Authorized Resellers in the EU will be able to continue selling the iPhones until their remaining inventory is depleted, the report said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/iphone-se-4-expected-to-launch-in-march/\">fourth-generation iPhone SE with a USB-C port in March</a>, so the device should quickly return to the EU. Meanwhile, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus likely would have been discontinued in September had the USB-C regulation not existed, so sales of those devices are ending in the EU around nine months early.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/20/iphone-14-iphone-se-unavailable-in-switzerland/\">Apple Begins Discontinuing iPhone SE and iPhone 14 in EU Ahead of USB-C Requirement</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-discontinuing-iphone-se-and-iphone-14-in-eu-ahead-of-usb-c-requirement.2445836/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"de6b7fa37143b2c5387d7435643b346dbe1bfa9edcffc77e6a65fc4927393357","category":"Apple"}
