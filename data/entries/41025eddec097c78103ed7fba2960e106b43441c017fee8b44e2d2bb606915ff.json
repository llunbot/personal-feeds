The result is the <a href=\"https://tubolight.bike/diamana-features/\" target=\"_blank\">Diamana tire inserts</a> (€ 99.90), available in SL, HD, and XHD applications for XC through downhill racing.

This process can be mitigated by lowering tire pressure but then tire and rim damage are more common.</p>\n<p>They claim the Diamana inserts are the solution by removing the tire’s rebound thanks to the unique profile of these inserts. Thanks to the Venturi effect, the air is allowed to flow through the channels at an increased speed as these channels get smaller due to tire deformation.</p>\n<p>Air gets trapped into the inner portion and takes much longer to get back to the outer one, leaving the entire impact moment with very low air at the impact location.</p>\n<p>What do you think?
