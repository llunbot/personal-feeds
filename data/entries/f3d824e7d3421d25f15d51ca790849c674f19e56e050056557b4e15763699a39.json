The Texan automaker issued a recall for nearly 12,000 vehicles after an over-the-air software update introduced a new bug that can cause false activations of the cars' forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking (AEB) systems.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V846-7836.PDF\">the safety recall report</a>, the problem affects Models S, X, and 3 vehicles built between 2017 and 2021 and Model Y vehicles built between 2020 and 2021 that are running firmware release 2021.36.5.2. The updated firmware was rolled out to drivers in its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/08/musk-turns-on-teslas-latest-full-self-driving-beta-says-its-actually-not-great/\">beta testing program</a> on October 23 and, once installed, caused a pair of chips to stop talking to each other when the vehicle wakes up from \"sentry mode\" or \"summon standby mode.\"</p>\n<p>That error prevents the neural networks that operate on one of the chips from running consistently, causing it to throw false-positive collision warnings and—more seriously—false-positive AEB activations.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809640#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809640&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
