Even after being encouraged to bring them for a recent trip, I was on the fence–until we got an email from Crankbrothers. They would soon be launching their new Guardian Handguards, and this seemed like a perfect chance to test them out before the launch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m glad I did. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why would you need

And beautiful. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the more moto-inspired mountain bike accessories, handguards do just as the name suggests–they protect your hands. The desert is sharp. There is always something trying to stab or cut you. On a lot of trails, these pokey plants are only in bounds if you crash or run off trails. But on other trails, the sharp bits come into play if you corner aggressively or the trails haven’t been cut back in a while. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of the desert, handguards can be useful for any kind of trail overgrowth, from long grasses to thorn bushes to larger branches. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>So why don’t more riders use handguards?</em> Aside from worries about how they look and any added weight, it can be tricky to dial in your cockpit setup and get the perfect position. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Handguards-QR-Hero.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Handguards-QR-Hero-1536x1536.png\" alt=\"Crankbrothers Guardian hand guards\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Handguards-QR-Hero-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Handguards-QR-Hero-297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Handguards-QR-Hero-120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Handguards-QR-Hero-768x768.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Handguards-QR-Hero.png 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>All product images c.

The Integrated model is heavier, though still lighter than claimed, even including the special aluminum clamps that replace those that come standard with your lock-on grips. Manufactured from glass-filled nylon for the arms with High Impact Polypropylene for the guards, they seem robust enough to offer protection short of crashing full-speed into a tree.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-26.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"858\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-26-1536x858.webp\" alt=\"Crankbrothers guardian packaging\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-26-1536x858.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-26-297x166.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-26-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-26-768x429.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-26-2048x1144.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pick up the Crankbrothers Guardian Universal for $49.99 for the set, while the Guardian Integrated is $59.99 for the pair.

I figured this would be the easiest way to get a pair onto a demo bike quickly, and get it dialed in. Having just received them before I left, I didn’t have a chance to try them out at home, so when I got to Arizona it was a true test to see how quickly I could get them installed and adjusted to my liking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, no one believed that we could get the guard mounting post onto the bar without pulling off the grips first. The clamp seemed very tight, and without a hinge, everyone was afraid that we would break it in the process. After the event, I confirmed that you can snap it on and off a handlebar without removing the grips. It’s a bit challenging, but the glass-filled nylon will bend, not break. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the arms mounted, the positioning of the guards was pretty straightforward. I did not feel like I needed the extra 12mm extender, and I picked the lower mounting point, with the guard about 3/4 of the way out. After tightening everything down including the quick-release clamps, it was ready to ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out on the trail, riding with handguards is one of those things you don’t really notice until you stop to look at them from the front. Sure, the sight of a big black plastic fender in front of your hands takes some getting used to, but after that initial hurdle, you kinda forget they’re really doing anything. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-24.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1226\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-24-1536x1226.webp\" alt=\"Crankbrothers Guardian hand guard with scratches\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-24-1536x1226.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-24-297x237.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-24-120x96.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-24-768x613.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-24.webp 1662w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That is, until you look at the front and notice all the new scratches. I know for a fact that the guards saved my hands from some shredding because the same plants ended up brushing off the guards and snagging my forearms on occasion. Mostly though, they quietly do their job and you’re very happy with them at the end of the day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your setup, they do tend to dig into the ground if you lean your bike on its side. Normally, the end of the handlebar grip would play the support role in the dirt, but if the guard sticks out any further, it becomes the fulcrum. The Guardians seemed up to the task, though the rough desert soil did put more scratches on the end of the guard this way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t have any <em>big</em> impacts to test out just how much the guards will bend before they break, but it seems like it would take a sizeable force to actually break them. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-13.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-13-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"riding with Crankbrothers MTB hand guards\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-13-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-13-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-13-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-13-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-13-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-13-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Crankbrothers-MTB-hand-guards-QR-lock-on-weight-13-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>Not me. Cory has also been testing the Guardians in Europe. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the entire package from Crankbrothers is incredibly well executed. Riders who plan to use handguards at all times will appreciate the clean install of the Integrated model, but for me, the Universal is perfect. They can be quickly snapped onto your bike for close encounters with cacti, and removed for days when the vegetation is more forgiving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.crankbrothers.com\" target=\"_blank\">crankbrothers.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/guardian-handguards-crankbrothers-integrated-universal/\">New Guardian Handguards from Crankbrothers Adjust to Fit Almost Any Cockpit</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f98d75904de826d5ae650dec86115b9a45dd07482bf15129bcbf52da0a657421","category":"Cycling"}
