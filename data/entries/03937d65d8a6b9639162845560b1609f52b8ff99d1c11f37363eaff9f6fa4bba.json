That's especially true when you compare the ROG Ally experience to Valve's Steam Deck and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/steam-deck-system-update-greatly-improves-older-lcd-displays-too/\">its finely handheld-tuned SteamOS 3</a>.</p>\n<p>Those ROG Ally complaints may be moot in the future, though, as Valve has confirmed that it is working to officially support SteamOS 3 installations on Asus' handheld.</p>\n<p>The first hint of the move came when support for \"extra ROG Ally keys\" popped up out of nowhere in <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4361258795952118018\">the latest SteamOS release notes</a> last week. Now, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot\">speaking to The Verge</a>, Valve's Lawrence Yang confirms that the note is indeed \"related to third-party device support for SteamOS. The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043131#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043131&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"03937d65d8a6b9639162845560b1609f52b8ff99d1c11f37363eaff9f6fa4bba","category":"Tech"}
