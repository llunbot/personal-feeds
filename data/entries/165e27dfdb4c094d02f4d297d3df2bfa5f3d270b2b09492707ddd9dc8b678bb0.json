Specifically, affected users are only able to read reviews submitted up until January 16 this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/app-store-awards-2022.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nIt's unclear how widespread this issue is, but it seems to be very inconsistent, with recent reviews showing for some users and not for others depending on the app. We were able to reproduce the issue on iPhones in the U.S. and Canada, but not on an iPhone the U.K., while the Mac App Store does not appear to be affected whatsoever.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-TikTok-Review.jpg\" width=\"1179\" height=\"582\" />\r<br />\nThe issue was mentioned last week in a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/19fk55c/is_it_me_or_have_there_not_been_any_new_ios_app/\">Reddit post</a> spotted by Jeff Johnson, developer of the popular <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stopthemadness-pro/id6471380298\">web browser extension StopTheMadness</a> for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Johnson said he could see a review for his app submitted on January 20 in the App Store Connect developer tool, but he could not see it on the App Store.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHopefully this glitch in the App Store matrix is fixed soon.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/iphone-app-store-reviews-issue/\">Some iPhone Users Unable to View Latest App Store Reviews</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-iphone-users-unable-to-view-latest-app-store-reviews.2417773/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"165e27dfdb4c094d02f4d297d3df2bfa5f3d270b2b09492707ddd9dc8b678bb0","category":"Apple"}
