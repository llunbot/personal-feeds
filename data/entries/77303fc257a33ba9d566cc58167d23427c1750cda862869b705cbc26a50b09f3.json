Users employ it to encrypt entire hard drives to prevent people from reading or modifying data in the event they get physical access to the disk. Starting with the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-1507-and-1511\">rollout of Windows 10</a>, BitLocker by default has used the 128-bit and 256-bit XTS-AES encryption algorithm, giving the feature extra protection from attacks that rely on manipulating cipher text to cause predictable changes in plain text.</p>\n<p>Recently, researchers from security firm Kaspersky found a threat actor using BitLocker to encrypt data on systems located in Mexico, Indonesia, and Jordan. The researchers named the new ransomware ShrinkLocker, both for its use of BitLocker and because it shrinks the size of each non-boot partition by 100 MB and splits the newly unallocated space into new primary partitions of the same size.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027056#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027056&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77303fc257a33ba9d566cc58167d23427c1750cda862869b705cbc26a50b09f3","category":"Tech"}
