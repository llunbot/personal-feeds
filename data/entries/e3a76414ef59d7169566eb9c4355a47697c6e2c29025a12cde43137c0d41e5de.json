It makes modern, progressive kit which is designed to be kind to the planet.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/universal_colours_unisex_gilet_back.jpg?itok=HNQpKTX4\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>This unisex gilet uses environmentally friendly water repellent technology and is partly made with post-consumer waste.</p>\n<p>It also claims to be highly technical, essentially using your own body heat to regulate temperature, storing and releasing it when needed.</p>\n<p>The gilet is reflective and has three rear pockets with a single zipped pocket for not losing your keys, and for stowing the gilet in when not in use. Neat, right?</p>\n<p>It comes in Slate Grey and Spruce Green.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.universalcolours.com/product/chroma-insulated-unisex-gilet-s2mp\">Buy Universal Colours chroma insulated unisex gilet (£150)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Honest Hemp chamois cream</h2>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/honest_hemp_chamois_cream_3.jpg?itok=33_-wOnf\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The dreaded saddle sore is one of cycling's major hazards, and is best avoided.</p>\n<p>Honest Hemp has launched a chamois cream, as part of its Active range.</p>\n<p>The chamois cream's key ingredients are hemp oil and menthol, which according to the brand soothe and cool skin whilst also making a good anti-chafing duo.</p>\n<p>An added bonus is that the cream can also be used on dry skin, as its ingredients mean it is multipurpose.</p>\n<p>Hemp oil is a derivative of the cannabis plant and is made by cold-pressing the hemp seeds into an omega-rich culinary oil. It does not contain any of the cannabis’s more famous psychoactive ingredient, THC.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/honest_hemp_chamois_cream.jpg?itok=ng5_o4Y_\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Honest Hemp’s chamois cream contains a balance of Omega 3, 6 and 9, products of the plant, which the company claims helps calm skin.</p>\n<p>Of note is that hemp oil is different from its cousin, CBD oil, which is made through extraction of the CBD compound from the plant's leaves, stalks and flowers and is also thought to have medicinal properties.

If that isn't a reason to get out on your bike then I don’t know what is.</p>\n<p>I find the justice system fascinating and the stories that come out of it even more so.</p>\n<p>14 years ago, the nation was gripped by the killing of 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy. Her flatmate, Amanda Knox, was imprisoned four years but later exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015.</p>\n<p>Knox spoke to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-59158568\">BBC Woman’s Hour</a> in her first UK interview for a long time about how she thinks her case would be viewed today, and it is an absolutely fascinating listen.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/back_to_life_.jpeg?itok=WUjWCIQ4\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Keeping on the prison theme (and BBC, oops), I’ve been watching a great TV show called <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0757vxm/back-to-life\">Back to Life</a>. It’s about a woman who returns to the small town she grew up in after spending 18 years in jail after committing an awful crime. </p>\n<p>It’s funny, bizarre and a total respite from anything else you might be doing. She also crimps her hair if you are in the mood for some nostalgia. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"ecole","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e3a76414ef59d7169566eb9c4355a47697c6e2c29025a12cde43137c0d41e5de","category":"Cycling"}
