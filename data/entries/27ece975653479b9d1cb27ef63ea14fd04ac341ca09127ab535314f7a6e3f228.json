Zuckerberg said the Vision Pro has no \"magical solutions\" that Meta has not thought of, and \"costs seven times more\" than its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/01/meta-announces-quest-3-headset/\">recently-announced Quest 3 headset</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Zuckerberg-Vision-Pro.jpeg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"895\" />\r<br />\nZuckerberg added that Apple's announcement \"really showcases the difference in the values and the vision that our companies bring to this,\" noting that Meta's goal is to offer products that are \"accessible and affordable to everyone.\" Vision Pro will be priced at $3,499, while the Quest 3 will be priced at $499 and the Quest Pro costs $999.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeta's goal with the metaverse is \"fundamentally social,\" whereas the Vision Pro appears to be more isolating, according to Zuckerberg. He admitted that Apple's approach \"could be the vision of the future of computing,\" but is \"not the one that I want.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nZuckerberg's full comments, as reported by <em>The Verge</em>:<blockquote>Apple finally announced their headset, so I want to talk about that for a second. I was really curious to see what they were gonna ship. And obviously I haven't seen it yet, so I'll learn more as we get to play with it and see what happens and how people use it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrom what I've seen initially, I'd say the good news is that there's no kind of magical solutions that they have to any of the constraints on laws and physics that our teams haven't already explored and thought of. They went with a higher resolution display, and between that and all the technology they put in there to power it, it costs seven times more and now requires so much energy that now you need a battery and a wire attached to it to use it. They made that design trade-off and it might make sense for the cases that they're going for.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBut look, I think that their announcement really showcases the difference in the values and the vision that our companies bring to this in a way that I think is really important. We innovate to make sure that our products are as accessible and affordable to everyone as possible, and that is a core part of what we do. And we have sold tens of millions of Quests.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore importantly, our vision for the metaverse and presence is fundamentally social. It's about people interacting in new ways and feeling closer in new ways. Our device is also about being active and doing things. By contrast, every demo that they showed was a person sitting on a couch by themself. I mean, that could be the vision of the future of computing, but like, it's not the one that I want. There's a real philosophical difference in terms of how we're approaching this. And seeing what they put out there and how they're going to compete just made me even more excited and in a lot of ways optimistic that what we're doing matters and is going to succeed. But it's going to be a fun journey.</blockquote>Just days before WWDC, Meta previewed the Quest 3, its next-generation mixed reality headset. Launching later this year, the headset features a 40% slimmer and more comfortable design, a higher-resolution display, and up to twice the graphics performance as the Quest 2. The headset will start at $499 with 128GB of storage, and the company plans to share more details about it at an event on September 27.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said the Vision Pro will be available in the U.S. in early 2024.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-zuckerberg/\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/\">Meta</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/08/zuckerberg-responds-to-apple-vision-pro/\">Mark Zuckerberg Says Apple Vision Pro Has No 'Magical Solutions'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mark-zuckerberg-says-apple-vision-pro-has-no-magical-solutions.2392271/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"27ece975653479b9d1cb27ef63ea14fd04ac341ca09127ab535314f7a6e3f228","category":"Apple"}
