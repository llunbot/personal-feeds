And for 2024’s top 5, it’s a mix of subdued classic and modern road bikes, plus a new race-focused gravel bike that we covered at Bespoked. Although beautiful in the details, this feels like a less flashy crop of bikes compared to recent years. Festka co-founder Michael Moureček attributes that to cyclists simply wanting to get back out and ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the top bike is still a stunner, from the limited edition Elements collection with deep transparent paint inspired by fire!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Most popular 2024 Festka custom carbon road &amp; gravel bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-1-Spectre-Fire-Ondrej-riding-in-Kuala-Lumpur-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-1-Spectre-Fire-Ondrej-riding-in-Kuala-Lumpur-jpg.webp\" alt=\"5 Most Popular Custom Festka Bikes of 2024, #1 Festka Spectre Fire ridden by Ondřej Novotný\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-1-Spectre-Fire-Ondrej-riding-in-Kuala-Lumpur-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-1-Spectre-Fire-Ondrej-riding-in-Kuala-Lumpur-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-1-Spectre-Fire-Ondrej-riding-in-Kuala-Lumpur-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-1-Spectre-Fire-Ondrej-riding-in-Kuala-Lumpur-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-1-Spectre-Fire-Ondrej-riding-in-Kuala-Lumpur-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-1-Spectre-Fire-Ondrej-riding-in-Kuala-Lumpur-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(All photos/Festka)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The year 2024 was marked by minimalist designs.

That bike became the original Festka One Gravel, and has a similar, almost low-key transparent chameleon green paint job revealing the unique structure of the CompoTech wound carbon tubes underneath.

It’s the first all-new bike model for the brand since their 2021 <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/festka-scout-custom-carbon-gravel-bike-fills-in-the-details-for-adventure/\" target=\"_blank\">Scout</a> (now discontinued, but soon to be replaced by a revamped adventure Rover). While a lot of gravel bikes have gone for a do-it-all approach – and the Rover will still be able to do that – Michael wanted to create a race-ready gravel bike for himself. And it seems Festka fans were on board with the concept too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an ultra-stiff 1x-specific gravel race bike meant to be as fast as the fastest road bikes, but still with enough space for 44mm tires. Note: Festka updated the Spectre Gravel with a bit more accommodating geometry since we first saw this complete bike which belongs to Michael Moureček.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2nd place: Festka Scalatore for Lab 306</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-2-Scalatore-Lab-306-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-2-Scalatore-Lab-306-jpg.webp\" alt=\"5 Most Popular Custom Festka Bikes of 2024, #2 Festka Scalatore Lab 306\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-2-Scalatore-Lab-306-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-2-Scalatore-Lab-306-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-2-Scalatore-Lab-306-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-2-Scalatore-Lab-306-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/5-Most-Popular-Custom-Festka-Bikes-of-2024_No-2-Scalatore-Lab-306-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“This bike carries an incredible personal story.
