And talking. The Verge team was\npacked in a glass booth, and as Gemini Live droned on, a friendly\nGoogle employee encouraged me to “go ahead and interrupt it.”</p>\n\n<p>It felt weird! I don’t mind interrupting Google Assistant in my\ncar. In fact, I can be downright abusive to most of these bots. I\ncall them names and interrupt them with ease. But Gemini Live felt\ndifferent. The pleasing masculine tone of the voice, the easy way\nit spoke. It felt a little too human for me to interrupt.</p>\n\n<p>My next question led to a similar interaction. I asked for ideas\non how to entertain my dog, and Gemini Live just started talking.\nThe only way I could get it to stop was to interrupt it. Which I\ndid repeatedly. It was like talking to my 9-year-old godson. Like\nhim, Gemini Live doesn’t know how to read the cues on my face,\ndoesn’t know when to acknowledge that, actually, I don’t care as\nmuch about the subject at hand as it does.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The comparison to a 9-year-old is apt. There’s no path to LLM assistants <em>not</em> being socially awkward without going through stages of sometimes-embarrassing awkwardness.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/17/gemini-precocious-but-awkward\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0d937851e3551978149b4fc12a109c25dcd975e9e69b6cc3bb66e0c096e49c51","category":"Tech"}
