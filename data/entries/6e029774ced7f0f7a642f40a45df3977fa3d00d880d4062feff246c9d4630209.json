When ground controllers gave the go-ahead, the mini-lab began growing crystals of ritonavir, a drug commonly used to treat HIV.</p>\n<p>The experiment’s 27-hour run was completed on June 30, and data downlinked from the spacecraft showed everything went well.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952343#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952343&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6e029774ced7f0f7a642f40a45df3977fa3d00d880d4062feff246c9d4630209","category":"Tech"}
