As of December 11, it no longer sells perpetual licenses with VMware products. VMware, whose <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/05/broadcom-will-pay-61-billion-to-become-the-latest-company-to-acquire-vmware/\">$61 billion acquisition by Broadcom</a> closed in November, also announced on Monday that it will no longer sell support and subscription (SnS) for VMware products with perpetual licenses. Moving forward, VMware will only offer term licenses or subscriptions, according to its VMware <a href=\"https://news.vmware.com/company/vmware-by-broadcom-business-transformation?ref=thestack.technology\">blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>VMware customers with perpetual licenses and active support contracts can continue using them. VMware \"will continue to provide support as defined in contractual commitments,\" Krish Prasad, senior vice president and general manager for VMware's Cloud Foundation Division, wrote. But when customers' SnS terms end, they won't have any support.</p>\n<p>Broadcom hopes this will force customers into subscriptions, and it's offering \"upgrade pricing incentives\" that weren't detailed in the blog for customers who switch from perpetual licensing to a subscription.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990440#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990440&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6eb16c90945e6a9eddad56b907a01bf2d6aaba0e61d805923746237993654850","category":"Tech"}
