The Sufferfest’s individually athlete-tailored 4DP Four-Dimensional Powertech underlies the new, broadened Systm training platform, adapting every new workout to the optimal intensity for you to get the most out of your virtual training. But now beyond classic Sufferfest race montage videos, there are a ton of new ways to stay focused on your new training plan.</p><p>Wahoo describes their new Systm training platform as a “<em>comprehensive, science-based approach to training, with a diverse workout library that includes immersive cycling, running and swimming sessions, yoga, bodyweight-based strength training, and mental training.</em>”</p><h3>Many more training library options to keep you motivated</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090700/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_categories.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090700/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_categories.jpg\" alt=\"Wahoo Systm cycling structured training app, based on The Sufferfest, categories\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090700/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_categories.jpg 1800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090700/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_categories-297x178.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090700/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_categories-800x480.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090700/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_categories-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090700/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_categories-768x461.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090700/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_categories-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"></a></p><p>That new library includes cycling, running, swimming, yoga, strength training with a more focused approach to benefit multi-sport athletes, and even mental training exercises to get you prepped to race &amp; help maximize your recoveries. Plus, Systm also now adds more immersive training categories as well.</p><p>Classic <em>The Sufferfest</em> videos carry over with their engaging mix of real pro race video, motivational music, and entertaining storylines that keep you engaged while suffering.</p><p>Add to that a new <em>Pro Rides</em> series that drops you deeper into the mix of a real race simulation, paired to&nbsp;first-person camera footage from an actual pro cyclist in a race. Your workout gets based on that elite rider’s real race power output data, scaled down to your actual 4DP profile so you feel the effort just like they did.</p><p>If you want to go deeper, the new <em>A Week With</em> channel lets Systm users shadow one of Wahoo’s sponsored athletes for a full week behind the scenes. You’ll get to experience not only how they train, but also how they live &amp; work off-the-bike, and how that impacts their training regimine.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090704/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_motivation.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090704/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_motivation.jpg\" alt=\"Wahoo Systm cycling structured training app, based on The Sufferfest, motivation\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090704/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_motivation.jpg 1800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090704/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_motivation-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090704/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_motivation-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090704/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_motivation-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090704/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_motivation-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090704/Wahoo-Systm-cycling-structured-training-app_based-on-The-Sufferfest_motivation-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"></a></p><p>There’s also a new <em>On Location</em> series footage that takes you on a guided ride of some of the most iconic cycling routes in the world. And a new <em>Inspiration</em> channel that compiles cycling-themed films and documentaries that are meant to be paired to your recovery and endurance workouts for when intense power-based intervals aren’t in the training plan.</p><p>There’s even a new series of instructor-led workouts by <em>GCN</em> hosts when you want to get that class workout vibe from your home pain cave, or pure &amp; simple <em>NoVid</em> no video structured workouts for when you don’t want all the fluff, and just want to get down to business.</p><h3>Plans, options, system compatibility</h3><p>Wahoo says their new Systm offers a wide range of “world class” training plans with cross-training built-in, that have all been developed by The Wahoo Sports Science Division, led by respected coach Neal Henderson, to help athletes target their own individual goals and tailor them to the amount to time you actually have to spend training.</p><p>The Systm also adds a forum for users to build a training community and offer group guidance, suggestions &amp; support.</p><p>The entire Systm was design to work across platforms, so there are desktop apps available for both Mac &amp; PC computers to get deep into the options at home. Plus, iOS &amp; Android mobile apps give you full control over your training system and actual workouts in-process from almost any smart mobile device.</p><h3>Future Systm options</h3><p>Beyond all the current training features currently built-in, Wahoo recognizes Systm as an ongoing platform and already has plans for more features. Coming soon will be more training load analytics to track your progress in depth over time, a new Outside Ride Sync feature so you can take indoor training out on the road,&nbsp; and deeper management integration with all of your current Wahoo smart trainers &amp; tracking devices.</p><h3>How much does Wahoo Systm cost?</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090716/Wahoo-Systm-training-app-expands-fitness-gains-based-on-The-Sufferfest-view.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090716/Wahoo-Systm-training-app-expands-fitness-gains-based-on-The-Sufferfest-view.jpg\" alt=\"Wahoo Systm cycling structured training app, based on The Sufferfest videos\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090716/Wahoo-Systm-training-app-expands-fitness-gains-based-on-The-Sufferfest-view.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090716/Wahoo-Systm-training-app-expands-fitness-gains-based-on-The-Sufferfest-view-297x167.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090716/Wahoo-Systm-training-app-expands-fitness-gains-based-on-The-Sufferfest-view-800x450.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090716/Wahoo-Systm-training-app-expands-fitness-gains-based-on-The-Sufferfest-view-120x68.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090716/Wahoo-Systm-training-app-expands-fitness-gains-based-on-The-Sufferfest-view-768x432.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/28090716/Wahoo-Systm-training-app-expands-fitness-gains-based-on-The-Sufferfest-view-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>With all the training features in the world, cost will be a deciding factor for many. The good news here, all the newly added functionality comes at the same $14.99 a month / $129 a year as the current Sufferfest memberships.</p><h3>Want to know more about your training? Listen to <em>The Knowledge</em> podcast.</h3><p>Mining that same wealth of training knowledge from The Wahoo Sports Science Division, the free new <em>The Knowledg</em>e podcast aims to help you make better-informed decisions about your training. The idea was to have training experts answer Frequently Asked Questions in a simple, but comprehensive 15-minute format that is easy to understand and digest. It might also serve as a good tool to help you decide whether or not paying for a Wahoo Systm training plan will help you meet your cycling goals.</p><p><a href=\"http://wahoofitness.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>WahooFitness.com</em></a></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ea19affaf3caaecc375d44ad395e417c9e14784979841fd2a18be1052b9afdd9","category":"Cycling"}
