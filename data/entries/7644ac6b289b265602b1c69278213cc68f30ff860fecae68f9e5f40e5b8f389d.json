He did not say which Wi-Fi version the chip will support, but it appears that it will be Wi-Fi 7.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Apple-Wi-Fi-Chip-Feature-Triad.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 17 models will feature an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain. He shared this information in a research note with GF Securities earlier this month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe entire iPhone 16 lineup already supports Wi-Fi 7, so this is not much of a surprise, but the fact that the chip will be designed by Apple is notable. Apple recently debuted its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/apple-says-c1-modem-is-just-the-start/\">custom-designed C1 modem</a> in the iPhone 16e, for cellular connectivity, and now the company is expected to debut an in-house Wi-Fi chip in the iPhone 17 models later this year. By designing more of its own chips, Apple can reduce and eventually eliminate its reliance on external suppliers, including Qualcomm for modems and Broadcom for Wi-Fi chips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWi-Fi 7 allows for data transmission over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously with a supported router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 can provide peak speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4Ã— increase over Wi-Fi 6E, if a device supports the maximum specifications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup in September.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-17-air-wifi-7-rumor/\">All Four iPhone 17 Models Said to Feature Apple-Designed Wi-Fi 7 Chip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-four-iphone-17-models-said-to-feature-apple-designed-wi-fi-7-chip.2449882/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7644ac6b289b265602b1c69278213cc68f30ff860fecae68f9e5f40e5b8f389d","category":"Apple"}
