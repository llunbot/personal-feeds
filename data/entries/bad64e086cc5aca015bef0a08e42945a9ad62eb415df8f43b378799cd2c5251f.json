For generation six, Toyota North America is going all-electrified, with hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains on offer. And while the RAV4 isn't quite a software-defined vehicle as we understand the term, it features an all-new software platform tying everything together.</p>\n<p>Toyota has grouped the various RAV4 configurations into three groups: core, rugged, and sport. And there are three different powertrain options: front-wheel drive hybrid, all-wheel drive hybrid, and all-wheel drive PHEV, although some trims are only available in certain configurations.</p>\n<p>Front-wheel drive hybrid RAV4s feature a 226 hp (168 kW) 2.5 L engine, with all-wheel drive hybrid models offering a slight increase at 236 hp (176 kW). The PHEV generates a combined 320 hp (239 kW), and Toyota says it can go 50 miles (80 km) on a single charge.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/toyota-debuts-all-new-rav4-with-hybrid-and-phev-powertrains-only/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/toyota-debuts-all-new-rav4-with-hybrid-and-phev-powertrains-only/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
