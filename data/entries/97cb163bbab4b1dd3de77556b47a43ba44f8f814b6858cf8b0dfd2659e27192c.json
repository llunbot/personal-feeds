For starters, they’re one of the three contact points where your body and your bike meet, so have to provide a suitable interface as well as an element of control.</p>\n<p>They’re also the means by which you transmit the power in your legs into the bike’s drivetrain to propel you along the trail, and are often subjected to the general rough and tumble of mountain biking.</p>\n<p>As a result, pedals are a crucial part of any mountain bike, but they come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and styles. What’s right for you will depend on where you ride and how you ride, but the first decision you need to make is whether you want flats or clipless.</p>\n<p>We’ve covered the basics below but have a separate guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/flat-or-clipless-pedals-which-is-right-for-you/\">flat vs clipless pedals</a> if you want to delve deeper into the pros and cons of each. Otherwise, our round-up of the best mountain bike pedals should help you to decide exactly what to fit to your bike. Every set of pedals here has been tried and tested by the BikeRadar team.</p>\n<p>If you’re upgrading from an old set, you can read our guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-change-bike-pedals/\">how to change bike pedals</a>, while we’ve also got a buyer’s guide to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-shoes-for-mountain-bikers/\">best mountain bike shoes</a> – once again with options for both clipless and flat MTB pedals.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h3>Flat or clipless pedals?</h3>\n<p>This buyer’s guide contains our pick of the best flat and clipless mountain bike pedals. Use the links below to jump straight to the relevant section.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"#flat\">Best flat mountain bike pedals</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#clipless\">Best clipless mountain bike pedals</a></li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Flat mountain bike pedals</h2>\n<p>Flat pedals are essentially just a platform for each foot. They’re double-sided, so it doesn’t matter which way up they are and there’s usually some extra grip provided by strategically placed pins.</p>\n<p>The bigger the pedal’s face or platform, the greater the area you have to plant your foot and the greater the contact between you and your bike.</p>\n<p>Flat pedals enable you to move your feet about as you please and, as a result, are preferred by some riders on technical terrain.</p>\n<h2>Clipless mountain bike pedals</h2>\n<p>Clipless or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/shimano-spd-vs-spd-sl/\">SPD pedals</a>, on the other hand, are a bit of a misnomer since they clip onto special cleats mounted on the soles of your shoes.</p>\n<p>The confusion with the name boils down to the fact that when this sort of pedal first appeared, its main selling point was how it enabled riders to discard the uncomfortable toe clips and straps they’d been using up until then.</p>\n<p>Clipless mountain bike pedals are also double-sided, unlike single-sided <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-pedals/\">road bike pedals</a>, and since they rely on a mechanical attachment, rather than the surface area and pins to keep rider and bike connected, they’re typically a lot smaller than flats.</p>\n<p>Some riders prefer <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/how-to-use-clipless-pedals/\">cycling with cleats</a> thanks to the feeling of improved pedalling efficiency and security of clipless pedals. Firstly, there’s the confidence gained from knowing your feet are going to stay exactly where you want them through rough terrain. Then there’s that connection to the bike, which makes hopping obstacles or going light over roots that bit easier.</p>\n<p>If you are using clipless pedals, pay close attention to <a href=\"/features/how-to-install-and-adjust-cycling-cleats/\">cleat position</a>, to maximise comfort and control on the bike.</p>\n<h3>What about clipless pedals with a cage?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Clipless pedals with a cage are designed to combine clipped-in security with the stability of a large platform.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><a></a>Don’t worry if you can’t decide one way or another because caged ‘trail’ pedals provide a halfway house between clipless and flat-platform models. They marry a mechanical cleat-attachment device with a large pedal body for a ‘best of both worlds’ option.</p>\n<p>Any time you’re not using rigid-soled XC or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bike-shoes/\">gravel bike shoes</a>, we’d recommend using clipless pedals like these.</p>\n<p>For downhill, enduro and aggressive trail riding where you want the feel of a softer shoe while still being clipped in, the cage ensures there’s still plenty of foot support and the bigger platform makes the mechanism easier to locate after a dab or foot-out turn.</p>\n<h2>The best mountain bike pedals in 2023</h2>\n<h3>Deity TMAC</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The large, concave platform studded with pins is a recipe for grip.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£140 / $170 / AU$285 / €170 as tested</li>\n<li>Clever platform design</li>\n<li>No-slip surface</li>\n<li>Low weight-to-size ratio</li>\n</ul><p>Deity’s TMAC flat pedals’ concave form and well-positioned, pointy pins create unrivalled grip and stability.</p>\n<p>Designed with input from freerider Tyler McCaul, the TMACs are big and square, measuring 110(L)x105(W)mm.

If you’re more used to Shimano’s SPD system, the amount of movement can be unnerving at first, though.</p>\n<p>They stand up to abuse in bad weather and we’ve never had problems clipping in or out when they are covered in mud, snow or even ice. If you’re not careful, though, when you’re clipping in the pedal can roll forward, caused by their cageless design.</p>\n<p>In our experience, the ATACs have shown themselves to offer impressive reliability, brushing off knocks and continued use through bad weather.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/time-atac-xc-6-pedal-review/\">Read our full review of the Time ATAC XC 6 pedal</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Buyer’s guide to mountain bike pedals | Six things to consider</h2>\n<h3>Platform size</h3>\n<p>How big you want your pedals depends on your riding style and what shoes you’re wearing.</p>\n<p>Cross-country riders with stiff shoes won’t need the support and weight of a platform, and will likely prefer a compact SPD pedal as a result, but in the context of gravity or aggressive trail riding, a platform provides foot support for softer shoes that have more pedal feel.</p>\n<p>You can find plenty of clipless pedals with a cage, providing that extra support alongside the security of being attached to the bike, while flat (non-clipless) pedals will always offer a large platform.</p>\n<p>As far as caged clipless pedals are concerned, the bigger the platform, the easier it is to locate and stamp back onto when you unclip.</p>\n<p>However, platform size is a trade-off with weight and vulnerability to pedal strikes, and this is the reason most have tapered leading edges and chamfered corners.</p>\n<h3>Pins</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Most flat pedals have removable pins that add grip.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Max Wilman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Most flat pedals and many caged clipless pedals have removable pins that add grip.</p>\n<p>With clipless pedals, these pins are reduce the floating movement of the cleat. These pins can help things feel less sketchy when you’re riding on technical terrain or unclipped, but pins that are too tall can interfere with the sole of your shoe.</p>\n<h3>Float</h3>\n<p>Calculated in degrees, float is the amount your foot can twist from side to side while clipped in (using clipless pedals). As well as being kinder to your knees, float allows freedom of movement in your ankles and hips that can make it easier to manoeuvre the bike.</p>\n<p>It’s personal preference, because too much float can feel wobbly and vague. Some manufacturers, such as HT and Crankbrothers, offer cleats with different degrees of float.</p>\n<h3>Release angle</h3>\n<p>This is how far, in degrees, you need to rotate your ankles in order to unclip from clipless pedals. Some pedals let you change this by adjusting the spring tension of the clip mechanism. Others require you to swap cleats.</p>\n<p>As a rule of thumb, beginners should start light and crank things up over time. For more experienced riders, a foot popping out unexpectedly is nearly as scary as it getting stuck in.</p>\n<h3>Durability</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mountain bike pedals need to stand up to plenty of abuse.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Pedals get abused – kicked, hit on the ground, caked in mud, and immersed in puddles – so they need to be durable, with good seals and bearings. If you’re using clipless pedals, the cleat mechanism must also last and be designed in a way that sheds mud so it’s still easy to clip in and out in filthy conditions.</p>\n<h3>Pedal Q-factor</h3>\n<p>Q-factor is the measurement from the outside of the crank arm to the centre of the pedal body. It’s added to the crank Q-factor (the distance between the outsides of the crank arms) to give the pedal <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/stance-width-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-care/\">stance width</a>. A wider stance gives more stability and crank/frame clearance.</p>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"97cb163bbab4b1dd3de77556b47a43ba44f8f814b6858cf8b0dfd2659e27192c","category":"Cycling"}
