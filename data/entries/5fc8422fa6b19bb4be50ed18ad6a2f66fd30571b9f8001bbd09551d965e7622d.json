Like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> charger, the ‌iPad‌ and the stand automatically align with one another.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/urban-ipad-stand-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce on the stand, the ‌iPad‌ is at an ideal height to provide an ergonomic viewing experience, and with the adjustable hinge at the back, it can be rotated around 360 degrees to any viewing angle that works best for you. It's useful for watching movies, working with a keyboard and mouse, drawing, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/urban-ipad-stand-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAvailable in either silver or space gray, the ‌iPad‌ Stand matches well with Apple's devices, and it is made from a hard, durable aluminum material that will last for years to come. It's priced at $70.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Urban Magnetic Stand is compatible with all of Apple's modern ‌iPad‌,s including the third, fourth, and fifth-generation 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models, the first, second, and third-generation 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models, and the fourth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/urban-ipad-stand-4.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have 10 of the Urban Magnetic ‌iPad‌ Stands to give away to <em>MacRumors</em> readers.
