The new sleeves pack a lot of features to keep your joints safe and scuff-free, and they come in a huge range of sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-protection-loam-knee-pads-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-protection-loam-knee-pads-1.jpg\" alt=\"woman mountain biking wearing the new giro loam knee pads.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-protection-loam-knee-pads-1.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-protection-loam-knee-pads-1-297x238.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-protection-loam-knee-pads-1-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-protection-loam-knee-pads-1-120x96.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-protection-loam-knee-pads-1-768x614.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The padding is D3O’s XTI impact-absorbing material, which is soft and flexible when you’re just pedaling along, but hardens instantly when it hits something to diffuse impact forces. Giro specs the Trivent version, which has slots in it to improve both breathability and flexibility, and it’s a custom 8mm thickness for both the Loam knee sleeve and Loam elbow sleeve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pad is covered by Ax Suede stretch microfiber so it won’t get chewed up as you hit rocks, roots, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-protection-loam-knee-pads-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"791\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-protection-loam-knee-pads-3.jpg\" alt=\"closeup of giro loam knee pad and elbow pad.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-protection-loam-knee-pads-3.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-protection-loam-knee-pads-3-297x147.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-protection-loam-knee-pads-3-1536x759.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-protection-loam-knee-pads-3-120x59.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-protection-loam-knee-pads-3-768x380.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the sleeve combines a highly breathable lightweight mesh back panel with an Italian-made stretch woven material. It’s then given a CAP armor print, a ceramic material printed in a grid pattern over the sleeve that helps it slide over the terrain rather than snagging and tearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only does this protect the material, Giro says it also helps keep you from getting caught up, helping smooth impacts just a bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-loam-knee-sleeve-elbow-sleeve.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1337\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-loam-knee-sleeve-elbow-sleeve.jpg\" alt=\"giro loam knee and elbow pads.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-loam-knee-sleeve-elbow-sleeve.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-loam-knee-sleeve-elbow-sleeve-297x159.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-loam-knee-sleeve-elbow-sleeve-1536x821.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-loam-knee-sleeve-elbow-sleeve-120x64.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-loam-knee-sleeve-elbow-sleeve-768x411.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/giro-loam-knee-sleeve-elbow-sleeve-2048x1095.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They mostly use Giro’s Renew Series materials, which contain at least 50% recycled material. The knee pads come in six sizes from XS to XXL and run $119.95. There’s also a burlier version called Lobo that’s coming soon and uses a thicker, removable 11mm D3O LP1 pad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The arm sleeves also have six sizes and run $89.95. Both are unisex, and they’re available now direct and through retailers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.giro.com/c/mens-bike-protection/\" target=\"_blank\">Giro.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/giro-loam-knee-pads-elbow-pads/\">Giro Adds Joint Protection w/ New Loam Pads</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"eb9e8678c42cd10c836544f2d5484782ecbe206278232d58d083557df45ab72f","category":"Cycling"}
