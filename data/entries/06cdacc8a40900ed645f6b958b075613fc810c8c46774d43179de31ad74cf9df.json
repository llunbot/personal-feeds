{"title":"‘World Series Rings: Everyone Wants Them, No One Wears Them’","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/sports/baseball/world-series-rings.html","date":1636134060000,"content":"\n<p>Fun story by Tyler Kepner for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yet even George Steinbrenner, the longtime Yankees owner who loved lavish gestures, probably did not spring for 1,332 rings, the total that Crane distributed in 2017 to Astros players, staff, front office members, trainers, clubhouse attendants, broadcasters and so on.</p>\n\n<p>The Braves were similarly generous in 1995, awarding rings to minor league staffers like Brian Snitker, who is now their manager. Snitker keeps it in a lockbox.</p>\n\n<p>“The things are not real comfortable to wear, if you want to know the truth,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>That Braves ring — engraved, perhaps prematurely, with the slogan “Team of the 90s” — is the last one without a team logo on top, though naturally there are dozens of diamonds. Even so, John Schuerholz, the architect of the 1995 champions, did not wear it in Atlanta during this World Series.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That “perhaps prematurely” is impeccable Times house style for delivering a zinger in a news piece. (Another team went on to win in 1996 (over the Braves), 1998, and 1999 (over the Braves, again).)</p>\n\n<p>Glad to see the Atlanta Braves win this year, though, against the cheaters on the Houston Astros. Hell, I was even pulling for the Red Sox — the goddamn Red Sox — to beat the Astros in the ALCS.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/05/world-series-rings\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"06cdacc8a40900ed645f6b958b075613fc810c8c46774d43179de31ad74cf9df","category":"Tech"}
