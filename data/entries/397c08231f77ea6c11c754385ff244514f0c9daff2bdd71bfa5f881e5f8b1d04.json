Muc-Off CEO Alex Timnell says it was designed over three years with the objective that “it had to be just as good as our other bike cleaners, but in a more environmentally focussed and convenient format”.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Punk Powder comes in compostable sachets and the cardboard outer packaging can double as a funnel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Muc-Off</i></span></div>\n<p>Punk Powder comes in compostable sachets that ship in recycled cardboard.
