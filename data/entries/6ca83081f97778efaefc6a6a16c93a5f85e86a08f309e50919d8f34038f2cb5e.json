It advised countries to focus on boosting those at high risk—including older people, pregnant people, and those with underlying medical conditions—every six to 12 months for the near- to mid-term.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/28-03-2023-sage-updates-covid-19-vaccination-guidance\">The new advice</a> contrasts with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/annual-bivalent-for-all-future-of-covid-shots-murky-after-fda-deliberations/\">proposed plans by US Food and Drug Administration</a>, which has suggested treating COVID-19 boosters like annual flu shots for the foreseeable future. That is, agency officials have floated the idea of offering updated formulations each fall, possibly to everyone, including the young and healthy.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2792030\">a viewpoint published last May in JAMA</a>, the FDA's top vaccine regulator, Peter Marks, along with FDA Commissioner Robert Califf and Principal Deputy Commissioner Janet Woodcock, argued that annual COVID booster campaigns in the fall, ahead of winter waves of respiratory infections—such as flu, COVID-19, and RSV—would protect health care systems from becoming overwhelmed. And they specifically addressed the possibility of vaccinating those at low risk.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927482#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927482&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6ca83081f97778efaefc6a6a16c93a5f85e86a08f309e50919d8f34038f2cb5e","category":"Tech"}
