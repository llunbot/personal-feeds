Back for its fourth year and with Brooks England as a sponsor, North London Dirt is a creative take on the increasingly popular gravel genre of cycling events. What first started as an experiment in linking disparate points on a map through the discovery of often-overlooked paths, farm roads, and winding trails in and around North London has since grown into an annual event that brings together like-minded riders searching for unexpected adventure amidst a well-trafficked city. This year’s 70-mile (113KM) route will take riders from urban to suburban and beyond, all while raising money for the local St. Mary’s community center.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/image00028-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Additionally, North London Dirt will be partnering with <a href=\"https://www.ride4unity.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ride 4 Unity</a>, a global organization dedicated to celebrating diversity and togetherness in cycling.
