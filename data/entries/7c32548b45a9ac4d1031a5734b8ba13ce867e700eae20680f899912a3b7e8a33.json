It's a neural network system that can function as a limited game engine, potentially opening new possibilities for real-time video game synthesis in the future.</p>\n<p>For example, instead of drawing graphical video frames using traditional techniques, future games could potentially use an AI engine to \"imagine\" or hallucinate graphics in real time as a prediction task.</p>\n\n<p>\"<span>The potential here is absurd,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/NickADobos\">wrote</a> app developer Nick Dobos in reaction to the news. \"Why write complex rules for software by hand when the AI can just think every pixel for you?\"</span></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045767#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045767&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7c32548b45a9ac4d1031a5734b8ba13ce867e700eae20680f899912a3b7e8a33","category":"Tech"}
