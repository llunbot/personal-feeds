A <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/\">level 2 home AC charger</a> costs a few hundred dollars, and with a garage or carport, an EV that gets plugged in each night is an EV that starts each day with a 100 percent charged battery pack. Plenty of Ars readers have told us that a 120 V outlet even works for their needs, although perhaps better for Chevy Bolt-sized batteries rather than a Hummer EV.</p>\n<p>However, about a third of Americans live in large multifamily developments, often in cities that stand to benefit the most from a switch to electrification. And electrifying the parking lots of existing developments is often easier said than done. Some developments will allow individuals to install their own dedicated charger, and newly built developments may even have planned ahead and put conduits in place already.</p>\n<p>For many others, the parking spaces will be owned by the condo association or co-op, complicating the idea of giving each EV driver their own plug. Here, shared solutions make more sense, perhaps starting with one or two shared level 2 chargers as a pilot—often this won't even require extra work to the electrical panel. Costs are a little higher than for a home level 2 charger—between $7,500–$15,000 per charger, perhaps.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017499#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017499&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
