The Apple Watch Series 10 has launched and will be on sale soon! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Apple Watch Series 10 is the thinnest ever Apple Watch and has a bigger display. It also monitors for sleep apnea, offers faster charging, and can sense water depth and water temperature. The Apple Watch 10 doesn’t have a new processor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Apple Watch Series 10 was announced at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple’s September 2024 event</a> on September 9. It was the only Apple Watch to get an update; we had also expected changes to come to the Apple Watch Ultra and the Apple Watch SE. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Ultra 2 remains on sale, but is now available in a new color. Apple didn’t mention that anything had changed for the Apple Watch SE, but is available for pre-order, so something may be different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rumors had suggested the following updates were possible for those models:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Watch Ultra: New ‘black/dark’ color scheme, S10 SiP processor, new Digital Crown with touch-sensitive elements and light sensors.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch SE: S9 SiP processor, 41/45mm display sizes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Apple Watch release date: When do the new Apple Watches come out?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 10 was announced at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple’s September 2024 event</a> on September 9.

In fact, it is Apple’s biggest ever Apple Watch display – bigger even than the Apple Watch Ultra 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also Apple’s first wide-angle OLED display. This new technology should make the display more power-efficient, thus preserving battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pixels will also emit more light at any angle–which is a benefit since people view their watches from various different angles. The screen has a wider aspect ratio than ever before. Apple says that the watch is 40-percent brighter when viewed from any angle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also means that the always-on display can update once a second, not once a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Apple Watch Spec: What new tech is inside the Apple Watch Series 10?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Speaker</strong> – The speaker system has been re-engineered to be 30 percent smaller, allowing the watch itself to be thinner. The smaller speaker system doesn’t mean that the sound is compromised, on the contrary, media can be played directly through speaker for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Charging</strong> – The watch can also charge faster than ever before. Apple says a larger and more efficient charging coil means that Series 10 is the fastest-charging Apple Watch ever, achieving 50% percent in 30 minutes.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Apple Watch Health: What new health features does Apple Watch Series 10 have?</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-s10-features.png\" alt=\"Apple Watch Series 10 features and specs chart \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-s10-features.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 720w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-s10-features.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-s10-features.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Watch Series 10 features and specs chart \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-s10-features.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 720w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-s10-features.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-s10-features.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Watch Series 10 features and specs chart \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-s10-features.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 720w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-s10-features.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-s10-features.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleep Apnea monitoring is the new 2024 health feature (and it will also be available on Apple Watch 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch will monitor breathing disturbances while the wearer is sleeping.
