The frosted white finish is \"a popular color scheme since the ‌iPhone‌ 4 launched in 2010.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/vanamara-apple-car-concept2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nPatents don't guarantee that Apple will build an ‌Apple Car‌, but they do provide evidence that the company is researching vehicle development, and plenty of reports suggest Apple is going down the car track wholesale.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLast month, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/18/apple-car-fully-autonomous-2025-launch/\">reported</a> that Apple is picking up its work on an Apple-designed car and is aiming to create a fully autonomous vehicle. Apple is said to want to design a car that lacks a steering wheel or pedals, and with an interior that's aimed at hands-off driving. That said, Apple is still discussing the inclusion of a steering wheel, which may be required so people can take over in an emergency situation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/vanamara-apple-car-concept4.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em> also reported that Apple has considered a design similar to the Lifestyle Vehicle from Canoo, in which passengers sit along the sides of the vehicle, facing one another.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is said to be aiming to launch its self-driving car in four years, which would put a debut right around 2025. Whether Apple will be able to hit that goal will depend on whether Apple can develop a full self-driving system.
