Instead, the agency has asked SpaceX to use its Crew Dragon spacecraft to fly astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back to Earth.</p>\n<p>\"NASA has decided that Butch and Suni will return with Crew-9 next February,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson at the outset of a news conference on Saturday afternoon at Johnson Space Center.</p>\n<p>In a sign of the gravity surrounding the agency's decision, both Nelson and NASA's deputy administrator, Pam Melroy, attended a Flight Readiness Review meeting held Saturday in Houston. During that gathering of the agency's senior officials, an informal \"go/no go\" poll was taken. Those present voted unanimously for Wilmore and Williams to return to Earth on Crew Dragon. The official recommendation of the Commercial Crew Program was the same, and Nelson accepted it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045133#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045133&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"980f7632352badb9c0e848d35195b5848cf7e422b1a3be70576676f1c7c2e6c9","category":"Tech"}
