The feature uses OpenAI's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/chatgpt-goes-multimodal-with-image-recognition-and-speech-synthesis/\">GPT-4V</a> API to visually interpret a vector drawing into functioning <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailwind_CSS\">Tailwind CSS</a> and JavaScript web code that can replicate user interfaces or even create simple implementations of games like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)\"><em>Breakout.</em></a></p>\n\n<p>\"I think I need to go lie down,\" posted designer Kevin Cannon at the start of a viral X thread that featured the creation of <a href=\"https://x.com/multikev/status/1724908185361011108?s=20\">functioning sliders</a> that rotate objects on screen, an interface for <a href=\"https://x.com/multikev/status/1724922302708556279?s=20\">changing object colors</a>, and a working game of <a href=\"https://x.com/multikev/status/1724925816381792661?s=20\">tic-tac-toe</a>. Soon, others followed with demonstrations of drawing a clone of <em><a href=\"https://x.com/andreasklinger/status/1725213534806794285?s=20\">Breakout</a></em>, creating a <a href=\"https://x.com/samselikoff/status/1725151779615076545?s=20\">working dial clock</a> that ticks, drawing the <a href=\"https://x.com/awwstn/status/1725250076560568668?s=20\">snake game</a>, making a <a href=\"https://x.com/kenschumacherr/status/1725172202830438680?s=20\"><em>Pong</em> game</a>, interpreting a <a href=\"https://x.com/simonw/status/1725190274627014960?s=20\">visual state chart</a>, and much <a href=\"https://x.com/emollick/status/1725225722388812155?s=20\">more</a>.</p>\n<p>Users can <a href=\"https://makereal.tldraw.com/\">experiment with a live demo</a> of Make It Real online. However, running it requires providing an API key from OpenAI, which is a security risk. If others intercept your API key, they could use it to rack up a very large bill in your name (OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/pricing\">charges</a> by the amount of data moving into and out of its API). Those technically inclined can <a href=\"https://github.com/tldraw/draw-a-ui\">run the code</a> locally, but it will still require OpenAI API access.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984459#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984459&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d640a7c16cbbca597888d553cd9cee8c999e707864184f0717d293fe524095e2","category":"Tech"}
