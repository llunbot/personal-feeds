{"title":"Kuo: Apple-Designed 5G Modem for iPhones to Debut in 2025","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-modem-in-2025-kuo/","date":1694022569000,"content":"Apple plans to use its own modem chip for iPhones starting in 2025, according to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/qualcomm-is-the-main-loser-from-huaweis-adoption-of-kirin9000s-and-new-kirin-chips-e96080908f5c\">information shared today</a> by supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. He previously said the fourth-generation iPhone SE would be Apple's first device with the custom-designed 5G modem, but it's not entirely clear if this is still the plan anymore.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/5G-Modem-Feature-Blue.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn July, it was reported that mass-production of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/05/iphone-se-4-rumor-recap/\">fourth-generation iPhone SE was delayed until 2025</a>, so there is still a chance that it could be the first device with Apple's modem, but there have been conflicting rumors about the project.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has reportedly been planning its own modem for over five years, and it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/\">acquired the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business</a> in 2019. Based on the 2025 timeframe, iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models are expected to stick with Qualcomm modems. The switch to an Apple modem could begin with a future iPhone SE and iPhone 17 models, if previously reported <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/28/apple-5g-modem-failed-qualcomm-remains-supplier/\">development challenges</a> can be overcome.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear if an Apple-designed 5G modem would have any consumer benefits over Qualcomm modems, but it would reduce Apple's reliance on Qualcomm on the supplier side. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/20/apple-qualcomm-1-billion-lawsuit/\">Apple sued Qualcomm</a> over alleged anticompetitive practices and $1 billion in unpaid royalty rebates. The two companies <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/\">settled the lawsuit</a> in 2019.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/\">Apple 5G Modem</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-modem-in-2025-kuo/\">Kuo: Apple-Designed 5G Modem for iPhones to Debut in 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-designed-5g-modem-for-iphones-to-debut-in-2025.2400637/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7016f286559ff0669d219a01d3bf87587166d66877dbeb3ff3bff82fbfcc2603","category":"Apple"}
