This year, it’s transitioning to a voltage transformer supply. In a year or two, it’s just electricity supply.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015706#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015706&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e3f06c68fecfe3a60b098e8b7e8bb5223cb542d3faea6e20d839b496435729fd","category":"Tech"}
