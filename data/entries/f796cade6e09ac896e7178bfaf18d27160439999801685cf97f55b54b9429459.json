{"title":"iOS 18.5 RC is out now—here are the release notes","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2656294/ios-18-5-features-release-date-how-to-install.html","date":1746557919000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Two days after the release of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2649829/ios-18-4-has-arrived-here-are-more-than-a-dozen-reasons-to-upgrade-now.html\">iOS 18.4</a>, Apple has begun the iOS 18.5 beta testing cycle. The first developer release landed on April 2, and we expect a wide release in May (or possibly late April).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last few iOS versions had their x.5 releases in May, with only minor features and changes, and we expect the same this year, especially now that the anticipated <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2631137/apple-is-delaying-the-only-apple-intelligence-feature-everyone-wanted.html\">new Siri has been delayed</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated May 6:</strong> The release candidate for iOS 18.5 is out now, so the wide release will probably come next week. With the RC, the official release notes are now available.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.5: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the big Siri enhancements pushed back out of the iOS 18 update cycle and the iOS 19 beta starting at WWDC in June, we don’t expect much in the way of major new features—just a few touch-ups, bug fixes, and security enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contact Photos in Mail –</strong> In the three-dot menu (…) you can quickly enable or disable contact photos in Mail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Screen Time notifications –</strong> The parent device now receives a notification when a child device enters the Screen Time passcode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Satellite on iPhone 13 –</strong> All models of iPhone 13 can support carrier-provided satellite connectivity features. These vary by carrier and region.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.5 release notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This update also includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A new Pride Harmony wallpaper</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Parents now receive a notification when the Screen Time passcode is used on a child’s device</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Buy with iPhone is available when purchasing content within the Apple TV app on a 3rd party device</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fixes an issue where the Apple Vision Pro app may display a black screen</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support for carrier-provided satellite features is available on iPhone 13 (all models). For more information visit: <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/122339\">https://support.apple.com/122339</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some features may not be available for all regions or on all Apple devices.

The process for installing a beta has changed in iOS 16.4. Here’s how the new process works now:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Click Sign Up on the <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/\">Apple Beta page</a> and register with your Apple ID.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Log in to the Beta Software Program.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click <em>Enroll your iOS device</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the <em>Settings</em> app, tap <em>General</em>, then <em>Software Update</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in Software Update.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18.5: How to install the developer beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer. Beginning with iOS 18.5, you don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta. A free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958\">Apple Developer App</a> from the App Store.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in using your usual Apple ID.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Registered developers can choose to get the Public Beta instead by selecting <em>iOS Public Beta</em> in the Software Update screen. It may take a little time after registering as a developer for the option to appear in Software Updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out everything you need to know about iOS 18 in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-latest-version-release-problems-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18 superguide</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f796cade6e09ac896e7178bfaf18d27160439999801685cf97f55b54b9429459","category":"Apple"}
