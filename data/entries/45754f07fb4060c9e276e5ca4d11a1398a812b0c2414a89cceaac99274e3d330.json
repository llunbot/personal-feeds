Was the new mega-Worlds format a success? Did Glasgow put on a good show? In my opinion, the answer is a resounding yes. For me, this is the new Olympics of cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the Olympics is still the Olympics of cycling, but you know what I mean. This year’s World Championships was more than just a bundling together of cycling’s disparate formats; it was a unified celebration of all things two-wheeled that brought in a whole new audience and introduced us all to elements of the sport we were previously unaware of (or I was, at least).</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-folding-bikes-good\">Opinion: Folding bikes are terrible and you should buy one now </a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/colnago-v4rs-review\">Colnago V4Rs review </a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/shimano-105-mechanical-r7100-groupset\">Shimano 105 mechanical groupset gets 12-speed update</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>The thing I love about the Olympics is that once every four years it encourages us to engage with sports that we couldn’t care less about the rest of the time. I will happily sit up late to watch the quarter-finals of the archery, or marvel at the rhythmic gymnastics, and I feel a glow of pride when Britain scoops a medal in the taekwondo, even though I have no idea what’s going on. The Olympics just has that feeling of being an event – something that demands attention and can bring a nation together in shared experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it felt this year with the UCI Cycling World Championships. Most years I will get excited about the Road World Championships and keep tabs on the track racing and cyclocross, but I honestly couldn’t tell you when the BMX World Championships are held or who’s in it. The same goes for mountain biking, and as for cycle-ball… who even knew it existed? (OK, just me then.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year I found myself scanning the schedules so I wouldn’t miss the artistic cycling qualifiers or the BMX freestyle flatland. And when Britain came top of the medals table, I felt that same buzz I got when Britain came second at the 2016 Olympics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, Britain showcased itself as a wet and miserable place to hold a cycling event, but the crowds were amazing and the whole thing seemed like a great success. I can’t wait for 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photo </strong>Patrik Lundin</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>What’s in issue 144?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The forgotten world of Epirus:</strong> In the northwest of Greece lies Epirus, a rugged land of lakes, rivers, mountains and ancient villages.
