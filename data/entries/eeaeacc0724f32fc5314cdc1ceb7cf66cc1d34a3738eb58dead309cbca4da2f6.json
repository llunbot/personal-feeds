{"title":"Tesla’s Exaggerated Range Estimates","link":"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-batteries-range/","date":1690475624000,"content":"\n<p>Steve Stecklow and Norihiko Shirouzu, reporting for Reuters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles’ potential driving\ndistance — by rigging their range-estimating software. The\ncompany decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to\nwrite algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers\n“rosy” projections for the distance it could travel on a full\nbattery, according to a person familiar with an early design of\nthe software for its in-dash readouts.</p>\n\n<p>Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the\nalgorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their\nremaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from\ngetting stranded as their predicted range started declining more\nquickly, Teslas were designed with a “safety buffer,” allowing\nabout 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash\nreadout showed an empty battery, the source said.</p>\n\n<p>The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from\nTesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said. “Elon wanted to\nshow good range numbers when fully charged,” the person said,\nadding: “When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile\nrange, it makes you feel good.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is not an “everyone does” situation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive\nwebsite Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after\nan extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major\nautomakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.\nAll five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their\nadvertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but\none of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their\nadvertised range.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Starting to pick up a pattern with this guy Musk.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/27/tesla-range-estimates\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"eeaeacc0724f32fc5314cdc1ceb7cf66cc1d34a3738eb58dead309cbca4da2f6","category":"Tech"}
