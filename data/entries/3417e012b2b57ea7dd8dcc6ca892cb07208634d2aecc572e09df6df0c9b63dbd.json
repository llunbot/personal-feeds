And today they’re available for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$80 at Amazon</a>, down from the regular $129, within a few pennies of the all-time low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps one of the things we love most is how easy they are to set up with your iPhone. Once connected, they automatically sense when they’re in your ears and pause when you take them out, which is honestly pretty cool. The AirPods (2nd Generation) are powered by the Apple H1 headphone chip, which ensures they will deliver rich, vivid sound that enhances your music, podcasts, and calls. Picture this: you’re listening to your favorite playlist, you remove one AirPod to chat with a friend, and the audio pauses instantly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the convenience of being able to access Siri with your voice is pretty awesome too. Just say “Hey Siri” and ask whatever it is from it without needing to reach for your iPhone. Whether you want to change a song, get directions, or check the weather, Siri is there to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The model that’s on sale comes with a lightning charging case, so you’ll still need those old cables even if you have the newer iPhone models. The AirPods themselves offer up to 5 hours of listening time (or 3 hours of calls) on a single charge, and the case provides an extra 24 hours. “If you make lots of long phone calls with your AirPods, that’s a huge benefit you’ll immediately notice. Long dial-in meetings would regularly decimate my old AirPods’ battery life, while the new ones have plenty of power left,” our very own <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232610/airpods-2nd-generation-review.html\">Jason Cross noted in his review</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has since moved on to a 3rd-gen model, but at $179, they’re significantly more expensive than the 2nd-gen model. So go ahead and place your <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">order for the Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) at $80</a> since they’re still one of the best purchases you can make.<br /></p>\n\n\n<span>Get the AirPods 2nd Gen for $80</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View deal at Amazon</a></div>\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3417e012b2b57ea7dd8dcc6ca892cb07208634d2aecc572e09df6df0c9b63dbd","category":"Apple"}
