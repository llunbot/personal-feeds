{"title":"Google Mocks iPhone 17 Design Rumors in Pixel 9 Pro Ad","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/google-mocks-iphone-17-design/","date":1746574440000,"content":"Google this week targeted the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> in an ad for the Pixel 9 Pro, mocking Apple's design plans and suggesting that Apple often copies Android features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 17‌ isn't released, of course, so Google's ad is based on rumors that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> is going to get a horizontal camera bar at the back, which is a Pixel-esque design. Dummy models and mockups of the ‌iPhone 17‌ depict a thick horizontal camera bar for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models, and a slimmer, more Pixel-style camera bar for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle's Pixel lineup has long used a horizontal camera bar, but it has lenses arranged in a horizontal line. Apple plans to continue to use a triangular arrangement for the ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ models, and will simply expand the camera bump.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the ad, Google points out that the Pixel had a horizontal camera bar first, before delving into other features that Apple has allegedly copied. The video is positioned as a \"podcast\" featuring a Pixel phone and an ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n<blockquote>Pixel: Hi, I'm Pixel, and this is my friend, iPhone.\r<br />\niPhone: Good day.\r<br />\nPixel: There are a lot of rumors circulating about iPhone's upcoming redesign.\r<br />\niPhone: It's crazy. Can you imagine me doing the same thing you did first years later?</blockquote>\r<br />\nGoogle highlights <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/night-mode/\">Night Mode</a>, Clean Up, and widgets as examples of features that were available on Android first. The video wraps up with the ‌iPhone‌ copying a line that the Pixel says first: \"We want to remind everyone that these rumors are just rumors.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Please don't go repeating everything you see,\" reads the video description. Google has used the ‌iPhone‌ and Android ad format <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/21/google-pixel-anti-iphone-ad-series/\">in the past</a> to mock Apple's ‌iPhone‌ design decisions, most recently targeting <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/google-pokes-fun-iphone-15-usb-c-adoption/\">Apple's switch to USB-C</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/google-mocks-iphone-17-design/\">Google Mocks iPhone 17 Design Rumors in Pixel 9 Pro Ad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-mocks-iphone-17-design-rumors-in-pixel-9-pro-ad.2456636/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"338b0d163545c7ed2465cd3c31d40ef7524ea6e065eacfb1dcd5a14109937f09","category":"Apple"}
