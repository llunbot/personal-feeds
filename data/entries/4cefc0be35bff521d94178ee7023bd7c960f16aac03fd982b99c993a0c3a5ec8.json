So when Samsung boasted that the Galaxy S24 Ultra delivered a new standard of visual clarity, we didn’t pay much attention. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Corning’s new <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.samsung.com%2Fglobal%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-creates-new-standards-of-durability-and-visual-clarity-with-corning-gorilla-armor&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-2218472-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Gorilla Armor</a> has a trick that’s actually quite amazing—and one you’ll appreciate without needing to drop it first. Along with “exceptional scratch resistance,” Samsung claims that Corning’s new cover material reduces reflection by up to 75 percent. And based on the first images that have emerged of the new phone, it’s the best display feature since the iPhone 4’s retina display.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>I think sometimes Samsung doesn't know how to market this screen. For example, it uses the latest Corning anti-reflective glass, which makes the screen of S24Ultra look darker than other mobile phones, and it is very transparent, killing the iPhone 15 Pro, but Samsung doesn't… <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/qhyi2NrP1H&amp;xcust=1-1-2218472-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/qhyi2NrP1H</a></p>— ICE UNIVERSE (@UniverseIce) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1748376298219810898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2218472-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">January 19, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see in the image above from Ice Universe on X (formerly Twitter), the display on the Galaxy S24 Ultra is much darker, crisper, and clearer in bright light, eliminating the need to crank up the brightness and twist the phone into unnatural angles to read what’s on the screen. It’s a remarkable upgrade over every other phone and the kind of feature Apple would name and devote an entire section of the iPhone site to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple also uses Corning glass for the iPhone, but has settled on the company’s Ceramic Shield tech, which it has used since the iPhone 12. However, with the scratch-resistance and glare-resistance of the new Gorilla Armor, we’d love to see Apple make the switch with the iPhone 16 Pro.</p>\n\nAndroid, iPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4cefc0be35bff521d94178ee7023bd7c960f16aac03fd982b99c993a0c3a5ec8","category":"Apple"}
