However, she\nsuggested, the UK government may have broken a bilateral privacy\nand surveillance agreement in making the demand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2025/02/DNI-Wyden-Biggs-Response-1.pdf\">Gabbard’s letter is available here</a> (and I’m <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/DNI-Wyden-Biggs-Response-1.pdf\">hosting a copy</a>). From her letter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thank you for your letter dated 13 February 2025 concerning\nreported actions by the United Kingdom toward Apple that could\nundermine Americans’ privacy and civil liberties at risk. I am\naware of the press reporting that the UK Home Secretary served\nApple with a secret order directing the company to create a “back\ndoor” capability in its iCloud encryption to facilitate UK\ngovernment access to any Apple iCloud users’ uploaded data\nanywhere in the world. I share your grave concern about the\nserious implications of the United Kingdom, or any foreign\ncountry, requiring Apple or any company to create a “backdoor”\nthat would allow access to Americans personal encrypted data. This\nwould be a clear and egregious violation of Americans’ privacy and\ncivil liberties, and open up a serious vulnerability for cyber\nexploitation by adversarial actors.</p>\n\n<p>I was not made aware of this reported order, either by the United\nKingdom government or Apple, prior to it being reported in the\nmedia. I have requested my counterparts at CIA, DIA, DHS, FBI and\nNSA to provide insights regarding the publicly reported actions,\nand will subsequently engage with UK government officials. The\nUK’s Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, also known as the Snoopers’\nCharter, which I understand would be at issue, allows the UK to\nissue a “gag order,” which would prevent Apple or any company from\nvoicing their concerns with myself, or the public. [...]</p>\n\n<p>My lawyers are working to provide a legal opinion on the\nimplications of the reported UK demands against Apple on the\nbilateral Cloud Act agreement. Upon initial review of the U.S. and\nU.K. bilateral CLOUD Act Agreement, the United Kingdom may not\nissue demands for data of U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful\npermanent residents (“U.S. persons”), nor is it authorized to\ndemand the data of persons located inside the United States. The\nsame is true for the United States — it may not use the CLOUD Act\nagreement to demand data of any person located in the United\nKingdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m so pleased by Gabbard’s response here, including making it public, that I’m gladly willing to overlook her “back door”/”backdoor” and “UK”/”U.K.” inconsistencies. (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/df-style-guide.text\">DF style</a> is now to close it up: <em>backdoor</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>Short of the UK backing down and retracting its secret demand for an iCloud backdoor from Apple, this is the best that Apple and privacy advocates could hope for. The gag-order aspect of the UK’s Investigatory Powers Act prevented Apple from even fighting it in court. But a US ruling that would hold it illegal for Apple to comply would put Apple in an impossible situation, where they can’t comply with a UK legal demand without violating the law of the home country. That would actually give Apple the ground to fight this in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>It is not coincidental that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5305750/keir-starmer-trump-white-house\">UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to visit the White House tomorrow</a>. This is a message in advance that the US considers all aspects of this demand on Apple unacceptable.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/gabbard-letter-to-wyden-and-biggs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"152130390703bbd80df3ada9dc36449f5149653f3e6ec3ff685b5799b301c3b1","category":"Tech"}
