Several weeks filled with Canadian wildfire smoke and tornado warnings later, it was pretty clear that I had greatly underestimated the complexities involved.</p>\n<p>The e-bike I used for my testing, the <a href=\"https://fave.co/3ETaUle\" target=\"_blank\">newly introduced Trek Fetch+ 2</a>, is very good, and it readily hauled whatever I asked of it. But using a cargo bike is very different from any other biking experience I've had—and that's saying something, given the large range of bike styles I've now had the pleasure of sampling.</p>\n<p>So this review will be divided into two parts. In the first, I'll talk a bit about the cargo bike experience; if you already know what that's like, you can skip ahead to the second half, where we'll go in-depth on the Fetch+ 2.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968104#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968104&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2742c14416f4a809d555b44b4c67eaee00e6f8bdacae145cc6bedf2e513d3885","category":"Tech"}
