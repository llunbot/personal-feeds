They have a larger diameter than presta valves allowing for increased airflow and this makes setting up tubeless tires much easier. The 36.5 mm long valve stems work perfectly with Jones aluminum and carbon rims and wheelsets. They also fit many other rims as well. The aluminum base of the stem is smooth, rounded, and lower profile which makes installing tires easier without catching the tire bead on the stem. The large inside diameter features a beveled, all metal opening for faster/higher volume airflow and no clogging. The large valve stem ring nut has more surface area for your fingers making it easier to turn. It also has an o-ring to keep it tight. The valve cores are removable and replaceable. Sealed aluminum valve caps top everything off and even come with their own integrated tools. One cap is a valve core removal tool and the other is for bleeding air.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span>﻿</span><span><span>﻿</span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jones Aluminum Schrader valve stems with caps.</li>\n<li>Removable, replaceable, valve cores.</li>\n<li>Sealed aluminum valve caps with integrated tools for valve core removal and easy air bleeding.</li>\n<li>Larger inside diameter for fast and easy tubeless set-up.</li>\n<li>Stiffer, sturdier and easier to use than presta valves.</li>\n<li>Lower profile base which makes installing tires easier without catching the tire bead on the stem.</li>\n<li>Beveled aluminum base for faster/higher volume airflow with no clogs.</li>\n<li>Large stem ring nut with good grip.</li>\n<li>Replacement valve cores and caps available.</li>\n<li>Fits 8 mm rim hole.</li>\n<li>Length: 36.5 mm</li>\n<li>Weight: 24 g (pair)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://jonesbikes.com/jones-spec-schrader-valve-stem-pair/\" target=\"_blank\">Jones Bikes</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/b-jls-solenn-u-btgn_slider_1920x.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/b-jls-solenn-u-btgn_slider_1920x.jpg?w=1620&amp;quality=75 1620w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/b-jls-solenn-u-btgn_slider_1920x.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/b-jls-solenn-u-btgn_slider_1920x.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/b-jls-solenn-u-btgn_slider_1920x.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/b-jls-solenn-u-btgn_slider_1920x.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/b-jls-solenn-u-btgn_slider_1920x.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/b-jls-solenn-u-btgn_landscape_19.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/b-jls-solenn-u-btgn_landscape_19.jpg?w=1620&amp;quality=75 1620w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/b-jls-solenn-u-btgn_landscape_19.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/b-jls-solenn-u-btgn_landscape_19.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/b-jls-solenn-u-btgn_landscape_19.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/b-jls-solenn-u-btgn_landscape_19.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/b-jls-solenn-u-btgn_landscape_19.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.cafeducycliste.com/en_us/unisex-solenne-cycling-jersey-bottle-green.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cafe du Cicliste Unisex Dirt Jersey</a> $241</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Solenne is a highly technical hooded jersey, reflecting wilder roads ridden and designed to deliver maximum performance with signature style.

She stuck to her race plan– which was to rest early and try hard towards the end to make sure her body would hold up to the extreme altitude and unrelenting terrain. What ended up being her fastest Colorado Trail effort to date wasn’t enough to pull a race win. </p>\n<p>She placed 4th lady overall, losing her 3x CTR title to Katya Rakhmatulina, who set a new women’s record with an incredible 5 day, 1 hour and some minutes. </p>\n<p>It’s wild how many races one can do and still feel like a rookie! Lessons learned, heartbreak felt, but pure joy in the reaffirmation; Alexandera still sees herself as a bike racer despite questioning her identity following the TD.
