Nginx is now used on roughly <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/web_server\">one-third of the world's </a>web servers, ahead of Apache.</p>\n<h2>A tricky history of creation and ownership</h2>\n<p>Nginx Inc. was acquired by Seattle-based networking firm F5 in 2019. Later that year, two of Nginx's leaders, Maxim Konovalov and Igor Sysoev, were <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/12/russian-media-group-rambler-attempting-to-hold-nginx-hostage/\">detained and interrogated in their homes by armed Russian state agents</a>. Sysoev's former employer, Internet firm <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambler_(portal)\">Rambler</a>, claimed that it owned the rights to Nginx's source code, as it was developed during Sysoev's tenure at Rambler (where Dounin also worked). While the criminal charges and rights do not appear to have materialized, the implications of a Russian company's intrusion into a popular open source piece of the web's infrastructure caused some alarm.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003602#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003602&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1b1f3458573856ceb023cac97bcbf0faf38ee2ec20c49f8a209c14d8440dc4c7","category":"Tech"}
