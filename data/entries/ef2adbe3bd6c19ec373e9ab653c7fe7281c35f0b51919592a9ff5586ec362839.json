These are the first\npublic RSR updates that Apple has released to date. [...]</p>\n\n<p>iOS Security Response 16.4.1 is available through the standard\nSoftware Update mechanism in the iPhone or iPad Settings app, but\nis a quick update, requiring just a couple of minutes to download\nthe update and then a quick restart for the install process. The\nmacOS update can be installed through System Settings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve seen a few of these RSR updates while running beta versions of iOS, but I suspect those were all just tests from Apple of the RSR delivery and update mechanisms. It’s a great new mechanism for Apple, but one that they’d only use for truly significant bugs — ones they realize are being actively exploited in the wild, or could be to deeply detrimental effect.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/01/rsrs-for-ios-16-macos-13\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ef2adbe3bd6c19ec373e9ab653c7fe7281c35f0b51919592a9ff5586ec362839","category":"Tech"}
