Such a quick transfer makes the contrast between the grubby bustle of our capital and the serene cleanliness of Denmark’s rural west especially stark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A sense of calm percolates through the place. Everything from car journeys to restaurant menus is well ordered and precise. It isn’t hard to see why the area gave rise to the creation of Lego, which originated in Billund in 1932. Or CeramicSpeed, a bearing and components company that has developed a reputation for quality and performance in the cycling world and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering it now distributes in more than 50 countries and supplies the military and aerospace as well as cycling, it’s hard to believe CeramicSpeed started in the living room of founder Jacob Csizmadia as recently as the late 1990s. Today the brand’s modern, monolithic headquarters take up a fair chunk of an industrial park just outside the town of Holstebro, though it hasn’t moved far from its birthplace.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-02-970x647.webp\" alt=\"CeramicSpeed insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-02-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-02-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-02-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-02-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-02-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-02-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-02-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-02-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-02.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Jacob lives next door,’ says Martin Banke, CeramicSpeed’s managing director. ‘When the company began to expand, Jacob was adamant that it needed to stay in the area. He wanted to support Holstebro’s local community with job opportunities, and he knew the community was the secret to our success. As you’ve seen, a strong work ethic that values precision and repeatability is in the culture around here.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One technician can assemble 50 common bearings in an hour, and quality control is done by man as much as machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘These guys are so attuned they can tell if a bearing has been incorrectly assembled by feel, even by how it sounds,’ says Banke. ‘Bearings should have 50 to 60 microns of play in them so they’re correctly preloaded once installed.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-03-970x647.webp\" alt=\"CeramicSpeed insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-03-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-03-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-03-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-03-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-03-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-03-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-03-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-03-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-03.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Such commitment from its employees is rewarded with, or perhaps inspired by, an airy and bright working environment. Huge windows let in piercingly bright Scandinavian sunlight as well as forming large parts of the walls separating one room from another.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>‘We wanted our departments to feel connected because no matter whether our staff are in assembly or accounts they’re equally integral to the company,’ says Banke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The premises are laid out in order of production. Balls and races start at one end of the building and the packaged product leaves at the other. No matter where you are in the building, however, it’s immaculate. The bearing assembly areas have the air of an operating theatre. While CeramicSpeed’s surgeons go about their tasks in a more relaxed manner, their job has to be no less exact: CeramicSpeed’s ball bearings are sized in increments of 2.5 microns (the diameter of a human hair is around 70 microns) and every bearing is made to order.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-04-970x647.webp\" alt=\"CeramicSpeed insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-04-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-04-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-04-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-04-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-04-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-04-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-04-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-04-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-04.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Those orders come from several industries. CeramicSpeed makes anything from tiny pulley wheel bearings to huge ones, 30cm or more across, that are fitted into things like tank turrets. Other, super-light ones go into satellites. The largest ‘bearing’ the company has ever made, though, is kept in house. It’s a light fitting that occupies a huge central column in the middle of the building, made to a 1:150 scale of the first bearing size Czismadia ever made: the 608.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company founder just so happens to be making coffee nearby when we reach the fixture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Man, it looks cool but that thing was a nightmare,’ Czismadia says. ‘It’s made from wood and just veneered in aluminum. As a true scale model, using the same materials as the bearing it’s based on, it would weigh 12 tonnes. The carpenters that made it hated me. To this day it’s the hardest product we’ve ever made.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/colnago-hq-insider-c68\">Italian ace: Inside Colnago’s HQ</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gobik-insider\">Clothes maketh the team: behind the scenes at WorldTour kit supplier Gobik</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/ceramicspeed-app\">New CeramicSpeed app offers car-style service reminders</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike-upgrades\">Best road bike upgrades for every budget</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Get your skates on</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s quite the statement given the scale of the company today, but CeramicSpeed’s forest grew from a single seed, says Banke: ‘In the 1990s Jacob was a serious inline speed skater. That’s where his interest in bearings came from. He got in touch with SKF, which is essentially the Shimano of the bearing world, about sponsorship, and they supplied him with some of the first hybrid ceramics outside of aerospace. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-05-970x647.webp\" alt=\"CeramicSpeed insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-05-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-05-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-05-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-05-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-05-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-05-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-05-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-05-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-05.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Hybrid ceramic means the balls are ceramic and the races are steel, which is the composition of our bearings today. He quickly learned what worked and what didn’t, made some tweaks, then shattered the skating world record, covering 505km in 24 hours – around a supermarket, believe it or not. After that, SKF employed him as an external consultant so they could develop hybrid ceramic bearings for sport applications.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially Csizmadia thought roller skates would be the focus, but it was clear pretty quickly that cycling showed greater potential.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"1164\" height=\"778\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-07-e1747734172287.webp\" alt=\"CeramicSpeed insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-07-e1747734172287.webp 1164w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-07-e1747734172287-300x201.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-07-e1747734172287-970x648.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-07-e1747734172287-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-07-e1747734172287-750x501.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-07-e1747734172287-1140x762.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-07-e1747734172287-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-07-e1747734172287-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/ceramicspeed-07-e1747734172287-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>The bearing assembly workspaces have an operating theatre-like air.

He quicky learned there were other “upgrades” in play at the time where you could gain much more without messing around with your equipment.

A worthy, exciting cause doubling up as marketing platform to launch something is an excellent strategy, so we set up our own – the pursuit of the 1% drivetrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We aimed to make a drivetrain that would only consume 1% of the energy put into it by the rider. Even with our upgrades, a conventional drivetrain is only around 96% efficient. The Driven driveshaft concept came out of that in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We took it to Eurobike and it stole the show – there was just a crazy amount of attention around it.

Swedish bearings company SKF often supplies the races and cages, for example, and sometimes even full bearings that CeramicSpeed then takes apart, customises with its own balls, then reassembles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The balls are what make our bearings special,’ says CeramicSpeed managing director Martin Banke. ‘No one else in the industry uses such high-quality ingredients or takes as long to have them made. Our balls are made from silicon nitride powder, which is pressed at 1,600 bar and 1,800°C. They come out of the moulds “rough” so are then mixed with diamond powder and churned for 50 to 70 days to gently abrade them into perfect spheres.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hybrid ceramic bearings were first developed for high-speed use, such as in jet engines, which has caused doubt over their efficacy in a bicycle application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You still get the benefits of low friction and longevity on a bike,’ says Banke. ‘There is the potential for the opposite to be true – as the balls are harder than the races, they could cut into them and wear them out. This is where we stand apart. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Because our balls are perfectly round, they polish the races rather than abrade them. Then versus steel balls when the bearing gets contaminated with debris, our balls crush it outright.
