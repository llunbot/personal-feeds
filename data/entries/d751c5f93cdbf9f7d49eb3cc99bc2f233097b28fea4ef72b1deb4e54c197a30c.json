A lot of you pre-paid for these hats back in May when they were supposed to be in stock in June. Well, with supply chain shortages at the cotton factory it took four extra months to get our new run of Camp Hats in stock. This season, we went with the popular Caliche (brown), River Rock (cool grey), and Obsidian (black). These are the exact same caps as our last run, with a brass closure, brushed organic cotton fabric, our folk-art inspired Jackal on the front, and The Radavist text logo on the back. </p>\n<p>They’re in stock now for $45 at <a href=\"https://shop.theradavist.com/collections/all-products/products/fairends-camp-hat\" target=\"_blank\">the Radavist Web Shop</a>. </p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"d751c5f93cdbf9f7d49eb3cc99bc2f233097b28fea4ef72b1deb4e54c197a30c","category":"Cycling"}
