Apple appears to be on a yearly cycle with the MacBook Air, and the next generation could be released next spring. This article will keep track of what’s being reported, as well as offer a perspective based on Apple’s current lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>M4 MacBook Air: Specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get into the M5 MacBook Air, here are the prices for the current standard configurations of the M4 MacBook Air, for reference.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>MacBook Air model</th>\n<th>U.S.</th>\n<th>U.K.</th>\n<th>Canada</th>\n<th>Australia</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>13in, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD</td>\n<td>$999</td>\n<td>£999</td>\n<td>$1,399</td>\n<td>$1,699</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13in, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD</td>\n<td>$1,199</td>\n<td>£1,199</td>\n<td>$1,699</td>\n<td>$1,999</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13in, 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD</td>\n<td>$1,399</td>\n<td>£1,399</td>\n<td>$1,999</td>\n<td>$2,299</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15in, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD</td>\n<td>$1,199</td>\n<td>£1,199</td>\n<td>$1,699</td>\n<td>$2,099</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15in, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD</td>\n<td>$1,399</td>\n<td>£1,399</td>\n<td>$1,999</td>\n<td>$2,399</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15in, 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD</td>\n<td>$1,599</td>\n<td>£1,599</td>\n<td>$2,299</td>\n<td>$2,699</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>M5 MacBook Air: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Expected in the first half of 2026</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2653368/new-chip-and-ship-m5-ipad-pro-and-macbook-pro-updates-set-for-holiday-debut.html\">reported</a> in March 2025 that Apple is working on the M5 MacBook Air, but did not mention when it would be ready. But we can guess based on the availability of the M5 series of chips. A recent <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2653368/new-chip-and-ship-m5-ipad-pro-and-macbook-pro-updates-set-for-holiday-debut.html\">report</a> stated that the M5 iPad Pro and M5 MacBook Pro could ship in the second half of 2025, which means the Air would ship three to six months later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the M5 iPad Pro and MacBook Pro are released in October or November of this year, then we’ll probably see the M5 MacBook Air in the first half of 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>M5 MacBook Air: Design and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>M5 chip upgrade and little else</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2631068/15-inch-macbook-air-m4-review.html\">M4 MacBook Air</a>, Apple upgraded the chip from the M3 to the M4, the built-in camera to a 12MP Center Stage camera, and the ports from Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 4, and introduced a Sky Blue color to replace Space Gray. The new M5 models also had the same <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2505858/apple-just-gave-the-macbook-air-a-huge-upgrade-you-probably-didnt-notice.html\">higher 16GB RAM configuration</a> that Apple introduced midway through the M4 cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all those recent changes in mind, the M5 MacBook Air doesn’t have much else that clearly needs an upgrade. So, the next MacBook Air will likely be little more than a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2653368/new-chip-and-ship-m5-ipad-pro-and-macbook-pro-updates-set-for-holiday-debut.html\">processor refresh</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one specification that we’d like to see change is the base configuration for the SSD. It’s set at 256GB, which we think is on the small side. However, considering how long it took for Apple to get rid of the 8GB RAM configuration, Apple may stick with the 256GB SSD base model for a couple more generations.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/macbook_air_15_m4_sky_blue_7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"MacBook Air M4 15 Inch 2025 Sky Blue\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/macbook_air_15_m4_sky_blue_7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/macbook_air_15_m4_sky_blue_7.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/macbook_air_15_m4_sky_blue_7.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/macbook_air_15_m4_sky_blue_7.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/macbook_air_15_m4_sky_blue_7.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/macbook_air_15_m4_sky_blue_7.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/macbook_air_15_m4_sky_blue_7.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Apple introduced Sky Blue as a color option with the M4 MacBook Air.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Eugen Wegmann</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The current design for the MacBook Air was introduced in 2022. Since it’s only a few years old, we don’t expect it to change with the M5 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rumor mill has reported on plans for the company to implement OLED displays in its MacBooks, with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2550737/report-the-oled-macbook-pro-will-dump-the-notch-for-a-camera-hole.html\">MacBook Pro</a> getting the new display first, but that probably won’t happen until 2026. The MacBook Air could follow in 2027, but it’s also possible Apple will continue to offer the standard Liquid Retina display to keep the lines separate, as with the iPhone and iPad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2> M5 MacBook Air: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it launched the M4 MacBook Air, Apple also cut the price of all models by $100, bringing the entry-level model down to $999. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t read any reports about the pricing for the M5 MacBook Air. Apple will likely offer similar configurations to the M4, but it remains to be seen if the new lower prices will remain. The threat of tariffs by the U.S. government is a looming issue<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2521477/trump-tariffs-could-cost-tech-consumers-bigly.html\">,</a> which could affect prices. Apple could also keep the M4 around at $999 and start the M5 Airs at $1,099 like before.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"39d7af9af29fc4f3adca4fb513e6c5f02cded4da0b3aefa69ba31139de93c8c4","category":"Apple"}
