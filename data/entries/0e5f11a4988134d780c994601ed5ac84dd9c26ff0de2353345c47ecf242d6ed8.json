Based on the popularity and success of the SMC saddle series comes additional models featuring Ergon’s Core and TwinShell technology. What makes these saddles so unique is the patented CORE 3D® design. As your hips rock with each pedal stroke, the saddle moves side to side, following pelvic movements. This reduces pressure on the sit bones. The sensation is particularly noticeable if you don’t wear padded shorts.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://ergonbike.shop/collections/smc-core/\" target=\"_blank\">Ergon</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ergons-smc-core-saddles/\">Ergon’s SMC Core Saddles</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"0e5f11a4988134d780c994601ed5ac84dd9c26ff0de2353345c47ecf242d6ed8","category":"Cycling"}
