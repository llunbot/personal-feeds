[credit:\n                        Xbox Game Studios                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>Nearly a decade before this week's launch of <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, the <em>Forza Horizon</em> series <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/10/review-expanding-horizons-with-forza-horizon/\">began life as a plucky, goofy offshoot</a> of the \"serious\" <em>Forza Motorsport</em> racing games. Instead of confining you to just race tracks, <em>Horizon</em>'s massive map ranged from busy city streets to wide-open countrysides to muddy riverside romps.</p>\n<p>The resulting game curried a ton of favor upon launch, since it evoked the beloved and long-dormant <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/01/burnout-paradise-review/\"><em>Burnout Paradise</em></a> concept—with the bonus of <em>Forza</em>'s solid car-handling model at its core. But while each subsequent <em>Horizon</em> game has improved the series' technical chops, the formula hasn't changed much. <em>Horizon</em>'s best ideas have mostly come from wacky DLC packs that reimagine the series concept, particularly <em>FH3</em>'s Hot Wheels set and <em>FH4</em>'s Lego pack.</p>\n<p>In spite of this history, I went into <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> hoping fans wouldn't have to wait for another expansion pack to add that kind of fuel injection—but sadly, my hopes have been dashed. <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> remains merely the best open-world driving game you can buy—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/forza-horizon-4-is-the-best-open-world-driving-game-you-can-buy/\">the same thing we said about 2018's <em>Forza Horizon 4</em></a>. That means it's good, it's fun, and it's pretty. And it skips a few obnoxious modern trends, letting you simply play by yourself without microtransaction-related meddling.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810142#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810142&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2a285e567d334722b9bb173c60cc264e257f03157b9b1cd070398c8fc025c249","category":"Tech"}
