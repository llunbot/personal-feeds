{"title":"Nutrition Roundup: Skratch, Holos, Infinit, Gnarly & more!","link":"https://bikerumor.com/nutrition-roundup-skratch-holos-infinit-gnarly-more/","date":1686612796000,"content":"<p>As if there weren’t enough tasty <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/nutrition-roundup-tastiest-new-treats-from-sea-otter-beyond/\" target=\"_blank\">new bites, brews, and gels</a> at Sea Otter Classic, we’ve been trying (or just seeing) a smorgasbord of new energy foods and drinks come in recently. Everything from power breakfasts to on-the-go hydration, and even a little something for after the ride, here’s the latest sports nutrition to come across our desks (and kitchen counters).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Skratch Labs Tangerine Mango</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the summer of flavor this year, with a lot of sports drink brands launching limited seasonal flavors. Skratch has a new <a href=\"https://www.skratchlabs.com/products/hydration-sport-drink-mix?variant=40084843003975\" target=\"_blank\">Mango + Tangerine flavor</a> of their original hydration sports drink mix, and like all of them, it uses real fruit and fruit juice powders to flavor it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Infinit Nutrition Berry Blast summer flavor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/infinit-nutrition-summer-berry-sports-drink-flavor.jpg\"><img width=\"1440\" height=\"1194\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/infinit-nutrition-summer-berry-sports-drink-flavor.jpg\" alt=\"infinit nutrition berry blast sports drink flavor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/infinit-nutrition-summer-berry-sports-drink-flavor.jpg 1440w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/infinit-nutrition-summer-berry-sports-drink-flavor-297x246.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/infinit-nutrition-summer-berry-sports-drink-flavor-800x663.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/infinit-nutrition-summer-berry-sports-drink-flavor-120x100.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/infinit-nutrition-summer-berry-sports-drink-flavor-768x637.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Infinit Nutrition’s custom blended sports drink now has a <a href=\"http://infinit-nutrition-summer-berry-sports-drink-flavor.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">limited edition Berry Blast</a> flavor for the summer. Like all their products, you pick the flavor and the levels of electrolytes, carbs, sugars, etc., then it’s batched and shipped just for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gnarly Salted Margarita hydration mix</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gnarly-salted-margarita-hydration-mix-for-heavy-sweaters.jpg\"><img width=\"1642\" height=\"1005\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gnarly-salted-margarita-hydration-mix-for-heavy-sweaters.jpg\" alt=\"gnarly nutrition hydration drink mix with high sodium\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gnarly-salted-margarita-hydration-mix-for-heavy-sweaters.jpg 1642w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gnarly-salted-margarita-hydration-mix-for-heavy-sweaters-297x182.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gnarly-salted-margarita-hydration-mix-for-heavy-sweaters-800x490.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gnarly-salted-margarita-hydration-mix-for-heavy-sweaters-120x73.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gnarly-salted-margarita-hydration-mix-for-heavy-sweaters-768x470.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gnarly-salted-margarita-hydration-mix-for-heavy-sweaters-1536x940.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you just want to boost your electrolytes between rides, or maybe want something with less carbs for recovery spins. Gnarly’s new <a href=\"https://gognarly.com/pages/hydrate-launch\" target=\"_blank\">Salted Margarita flavor hydration mix</a> has just 7g carbs (4g sugars) but a healthy dose of electrolytes (500mg sodium, plus magnesium, potassium, and chloride) and B-vitamins. I preferred it at half strength as the stevia can be a bit much, but the flavor is great for summer sipping to keep the body primed for activity and heavy sweating.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Holos Overnight Muesli Berry Flavor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/holos-overnight-muesli-oats-power-breakfast.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1243\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/holos-overnight-muesli-oats-power-breakfast.jpg\" alt=\"holos overnight muesli berry flavor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/holos-overnight-muesli-oats-power-breakfast.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/holos-overnight-muesli-oats-power-breakfast-297x231.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/holos-overnight-muesli-oats-power-breakfast-800x622.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/holos-overnight-muesli-oats-power-breakfast-120x93.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/holos-overnight-muesli-oats-power-breakfast-768x597.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/holos-overnight-muesli-oats-power-breakfast-1536x1193.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Holos makes a lot of delicious flavors of overnight oats, er, <em>Muesli</em>, which also pack a lot of protein and end up being the perfect serving size pre-ride. For summer, there’s <a href=\"https://us.liveholos.com/collections/muesli/products/muesli-berries\" target=\"_blank\">a new Berry Flavor</a> that keeps the 20g plant protein, chia seeds, and probiotics, but adds berries and dark chocolate. It’s good, but I actually liked all other flavors better, and the Chai, Apples &amp; Cinnamon, and Vanilla, are outstanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Greenbelly Mud Meal</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/greenbelly-mud-meal-replacement-shake.jpg\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1321\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/greenbelly-mud-meal-replacement-shake.jpg\" alt=\"greenbelly mud meal whole food meal replacement shake\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/greenbelly-mud-meal-replacement-shake.jpg 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/greenbelly-mud-meal-replacement-shake-297x163.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/greenbelly-mud-meal-replacement-shake-800x440.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/greenbelly-mud-meal-replacement-shake-120x66.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/greenbelly-mud-meal-replacement-shake-768x423.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/greenbelly-mud-meal-replacement-shake-1536x845.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/greenbelly-mud-meal-replacement-shake-2048x1127.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who prefer a liquid breakfast but still want something filling and nutritious, <a href=\"https://www.greenbelly.co\" target=\"_blank\">Green Belly Meals’</a> Mud Meal is a meal replacement shake that’s made with real food. I tried the Vanilla flavor, which uses Whey Isolate and other animal-based protein sources, but there’s a plant-based Strawberry flavor, too. At 400 calories per serving and packed with healthy fats, oat and sweet potato powder, and various fibers, they’re enough to fuel a ride (or get a long one started), and I blended mine with a banana for a little more flavor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also check out their monstrous Meal Bars for on-the-go fueling…they’re filling, and tasty, and big enough that some jersey pockets may not hold them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Morning Complete green drink</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/activated-you-morning-complete-green-drink.jpg\"><img width=\"1312\" height=\"834\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/activated-you-morning-complete-green-drink.jpg\" alt=\"activated you morning complete green drink mix\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/activated-you-morning-complete-green-drink.jpg 1312w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/activated-you-morning-complete-green-drink-297x189.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/activated-you-morning-complete-green-drink-800x509.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/activated-you-morning-complete-green-drink-120x76.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/activated-you-morning-complete-green-drink-768x488.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of green drinks on the market. Athletic Greens has a bit of a pineapple flavor. Amazing Grass has a, um, greens flavor. And Morning Complete has a more citrusy flavor, albeit one with a strong stevia sweetness. If that’s your cup of (greens) tea, <a href=\"https://activatedyou.com/morning-complete/\" target=\"_blank\">Morning Complete</a> has a lot of pre- and probiotics, dried greens, adaptogens, turmeric, and more, to help fill in the holes of any diet, healthy or otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Athletic Brewing Fruit Stand Series</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/athletic-brewing-raspberry-sour-non-alcoholic-beer.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"857\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/athletic-brewing-raspberry-sour-non-alcoholic-beer.jpg\" alt=\"athletic brewing raspberry sour\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/athletic-brewing-raspberry-sour-non-alcoholic-beer.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/athletic-brewing-raspberry-sour-non-alcoholic-beer-297x212.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/athletic-brewing-raspberry-sour-non-alcoholic-beer-800x571.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/athletic-brewing-raspberry-sour-non-alcoholic-beer-120x86.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/athletic-brewing-raspberry-sour-non-alcoholic-beer-768x548.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First up for this summer is the new <a href=\"https://fbuy.io/athleticbrew/tyler244\" target=\"_blank\">Athletic Brewing</a> Raspberry Sour, brewed with real raspberry puree, a hint of salt, and light spices for a well-rounded flavor. It’s a limited time flavor, and if it’s like their other special editions, it’s likely to sell out in just a couple weeks. Grab it while you can!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/nutrition-roundup-skratch-holos-infinit-gnarly-more/\">Nutrition Roundup: Skratch, Holos, Infinit, Gnarly &amp; more!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"a2c6312537d95fe49978322da42dd9ab4aa6dc774fdf9b6f15c4b24c1ab1a419","category":"Cycling"}
