It was Stage 10 of the 1997 Tour and he had been biding his time. He had spent most of the race looking out for his teammate Bjarne Riis, who was riding in defence of the title he had won the previous year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Ullrich and his Deutsche Telekom team holding the line that the number one-wearing Riis was their main man, most observers could see it was actually the rider wearing number eight who was by far the strongest in the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a difficult stage. At 252km long and taking in five major climbs, including the final 18km drag up to the Arcalís ski station, it was one of the more testing days on the 1997 route.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-henri-pelissier\">Tour de France history: Pélissier ends 12-year French drought in 1923</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/coppi-tour-de-france-1949\">How Fausto Coppi obliterated his debut Tour de France</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-history-petit-breton-makes-it-two-tour-titles\">Tour de France history: Petit-Breton makes it two Tour titles in 1908</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2023: 3,404km route announced</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>As the peloton started its descent towards the foot of the final climb, the American sports network ESPN welcomed a special guest on air. Lance Armstrong was recovering from cancer but had been well enough to visit the race for a couple days. ‘What do you think of Ullrich?’ commentator Phil Liggett asked Armstrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I think he is going to clobber them today,’ Armstrong replied. ‘He’s a shy kid. I’ve raced with him for a couple of years and I think he is sincere when he says he is here for the team. But he’s also a big champion. I’m sure that thoughts of winning go through his mind. It doesn’t matter. I think he’s going to win anyway.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the way to Arcalís, Riis told Ullrich he was struggling and that his teammate should ride for himself. Ullrich was only 23 but was German national champion and had won a stage and finished second overall at the Tour in 1996.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, he wanted to check in with management before he did anything on the final climb. He drifted to the back of the leading group and spoke with his sports director Walter Godefroot, who gave him the OK. Then, seemingly effortlessly, he rode back to the group and went straight to the front.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The way he pedalled back to that group there, he made it look so easy,’ Liggett said. ‘I think we are looking at Ullrich in the making here. He is so strong.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Turning the screw</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The gradient on the road to Arcalís ramps up to 12% as it passes though the hamlet of El Serrat and it was here that Ullrich escaped from the leading group. There was no explosion of effort, rather just a ramping up of the pace, Ullrich getting out of the saddle as he rounded hairpins in pursuit of Cédric Vasseur and Jean-Philippe Dojwa, who were ahead of him on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon everybody had been left behind. Such was the power of the German, writes Daniel Friebe in his recent biography of Ullrich, <em>The Best There Never Was</em>, that his ‘500-watt rampage from El Serrat had been, physiologically speaking, the most prodigious effort the Tour had ever seen on a long climb.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ullrich won the stage by more than a minute ahead of Marco Pantani and Richard Virenque, and took the yellow jersey. He now led Virenque by just shy of three minutes. Riis finished more than three minutes back and now trailed his teammate by 4min 53sec.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two men embraced at the finish, acknowledging that the baton of leadership had been passed. ‘They say I climbed well,’ Ullrich said afterwards, ‘but I could have gone faster.’ The cycling landscape had shifted. ‘I won’t forget the buzz [in the commentary box] when he attacked,’ Liggett said of the excitement during the closing moments of the stage. ‘Everybody was waiting for it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Voilà le Patron!’ was the front-page headline <em>L’Équipe</em> went for the next day. Ullrich was being compared to Merckx and Hinault – some statement from the sports paper of record. Yet there remained significant work to be done on the road to Paris before Ullrich could bring Germany its inaugural Tour title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First he won a 55km time-trial in Saint-Étienne to stretch his lead to 5:42sec. Then, on the first Alpine stage, finishing on Alpe d’Huez, he pulled out another 40 seconds on Virenque after Pantani had disappeared up the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day, on the stage to Courchevel, he stayed calm when Virenque built a sizeable lead after isolating the yellow jersey on the Glandon. Realising he could never bridge the gap alone, Ullrich slowed and waited for his team. Riis duly arrived and paced him up the Madeleine to bring him within touching distance. Virenque crossed the line first, but Ullrich was right there with him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ullrich’s final margin in Paris was just over nine minutes. He had ridden two Tours, winning one and finishing second in the other, and looked destined to rule the Tour for some time to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, that wasn’t how things turned out. The peloton’s new <em>patron</em> would not be Ullrich, but the American who had spoken to ESPN on the very day the German had risen to Arcalís.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During Armstrong’s seven-year Tour reign, Ullrich would stand alongside the American on the Tour podium four times. He struggled with fame and expectation and in 2006 was implicated in the Operación Puerto doping investigation. He would never ride again. Well-documented personal troubles and a retreat from public life followed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently Ullrich has re-emerged, supporting a four-part Amazon Prime series on his life and career, slated for release in 2023. ‘It’s time to tell my story, my whole story, how I went from hunter to prey,’ Ullrich told <em>Sport Bild</em> magazine in late 2022. ‘I would like to take people on a journey through my life, with all the turmoil, setbacks and challenges.’ Nor is he ruling out a return to working in the sport: ‘I hope that after the documentary, when all the issues are discussed and, I hope, finally concluded, maybe some doors will open again. And then you can live life with more freedom.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-ullrich-1997\">Tour de France history: Jan Ullrich triumphs for Germany in 1997</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0034dc0ffc2dca3101ae69c29e21e6a61bf15c697cbc299211e0ae135a8de607","category":"Cycling"}
