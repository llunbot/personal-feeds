But unlike DALL-E and Photoshop's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/adobe-photoshops-new-generative-fill-ai-tool-lets-you-manipulate-photos-with-text/\">Generative Fill</a> feature, you can't select a custom image to expand. At the moment, v5.2's zoom-out only works on images generated within Midjourney, a <a href=\"https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F\">subscription</a> AI image-generator service.</p>\n<p>On the Midjourney Discord server (still the official interface for Midjourney, although plans are underway to change that), users can experiment with zooming out by generating any v5.2 image (now the default) and upscaling a result. After that, special \"Zoom\" buttons appear below the output. You can zoom out by a factor of 1.5x, 2x, or a custom value between 1 and 2. Another button, called \"Make Square,\" will generate material around the existing image in a way that creates a 1:1 square aspect ratio.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949715#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949715&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bbbd83b732f24a12ebfcc1f0f4813306b8c0ca9f651fbd7c764f51507e648956","category":"Tech"}
