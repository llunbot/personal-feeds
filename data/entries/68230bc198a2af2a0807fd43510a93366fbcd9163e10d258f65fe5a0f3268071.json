Galaxies rotate much faster than predicted by applying Newton’s law of gravity to their visible matter, despite those laws working well everywhere in the Solar System.</p>\n<p>To prevent galaxies from flying apart, some additional gravity is needed. This is why the idea of an invisible substance called <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/from-machos-to-wimps-meet-the-top-five-candidates-for-dark-matter-51516\">dark matter</a> was first proposed. But nobody has ever seen the stuff. And there are no particles in the hugely successful Standard Model of particle physics that could be the dark matter—it must be something quite exotic.</p>\n<p>This has led to the rival idea that the galactic discrepancies are caused instead by a breakdown of Newton’s laws. The most successful such idea is known as Milgromian dynamics or <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/dark-matter-may-not-actually-exist-and-our-alternative-theory-can-be-put-to-the-test-110238\">Mond</a>, proposed by Israeli physicist Mordehai Milgrom in 1982. But our recent research shows this theory is in trouble.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023652#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023652&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"68230bc198a2af2a0807fd43510a93366fbcd9163e10d258f65fe5a0f3268071","category":"Tech"}
