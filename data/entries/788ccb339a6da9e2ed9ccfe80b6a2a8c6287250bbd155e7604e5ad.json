The Californian brand says it plans to eventually distribute internationally.</p>\n<h2>Globe Haul ST spec and accessories</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Globe Haul ST comes in black or white.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized </i></span></div>\n<p>The Globe Haul ST features a step-through, one-size-fits-all aluminium frame. Adjustable handlebars and two seatposts (one slots into the other) enable the bike to fit riders from 4ft 5in to 6ft 4in (135cm to 193cm), according to Specialized.</p>\n<p>The bike itself measures 72mm at the widest point of the handlebars, 1,050mm tall (depending on seatpost height) and 1,680mm long. The claimed weight is 35kg (78lb).</p>\n<p>Relatively small 20in double-walled alloy wheels are wrapped in Carless Whisper Reflect 20×3.5in tyres.</p>\n<p>The Globe Haul ST’s hub-based, tuneable 772W motor has five levels of assistance controlled via the handlebar remote. This also shows the battery level, estimated range and an odometer.</p>\n<p>The brand claims the Globe Haul ST’s 700Wh battery has sufficient range to “transport up to 419lb for up to 60 miles on a single charge”. The removable battery sits in the space between the diagonal top tube and down tube.</p>\n<p>The Globe Haul ST is bedecked with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/commuter-bike-accessories/\">commuter bike essentials</a> that should make <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-to-work-guide/\">riding to work</a> or the shops that bit easier.

These include <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-pannier-bags/\">front and rear pannier</a> adaptors, a rear passenger seat, a front rack, a rear-wheel cover and a plug-in throttle.</p>\n<h2>When can I buy the Globe Haul ST?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The frame is designed to fit riders from 135 to 193cm tall.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized </i></span></div>\n<p>Only those who signed up to the online waiting list and received an email invitation to the presale will be able to buy the Globe Haul ST from launch (8 March, 9am PST).</p>\n<p>Globe bikes will be distributed under the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-direct-sales/\">Specialized direct-sales</a> model.
