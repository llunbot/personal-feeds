In addition, the report notes that WaveOne's website was taken offline around January and that several of the company's employees now work at Apple on various machine learning teams.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWaveOne was working on \"content-aware\" video compression and decompression algorithms to reduce the size of video files, according to the report:<blockquote>Leveraging AI-powered scene and object detection, the startup's technology could essentially \"understand\" a video frame â€” allowing it to, for example, prioritize faces at the expense of other elements within a scene to save bandwidth.</blockquote>It's unclear how much Apple paid for WaveOne or when the startup's technologies might be integrated into Apple's software platforms.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/techcrunch-com/\">TechCrunch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/apple-reportedly-acquires-waveone/\">Apple Acquires WaveOne Startup Working on AI-Powered Video Compression</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-acquires-waveone-startup-working-on-ai-powered-video-compression.2384938/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d4c25ed203337b2161babdb8cf78772d6bd6d176ce50993ce79c49daf4083512","category":"Apple"}
