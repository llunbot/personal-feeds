{"title":"The Original ‘AppleVision’ Lineup","link":"https://support.apple.com/en-us/112266","date":1711394581000,"content":"\n<p>I quipped in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/21/apple-style-guide\">my post linking to Apple’s updated style guide</a> that if Vision Pro had been a product from the 1990s, Apple might have named it “AppleVision”. Turns out Apple <em>did</em> make products under that name — a short-lived line of CRT displays. From a little birdie who worked on them:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It was an ill-fated (and largely disgraced) line of CRTs with \nautomatic color calibration built-in. [...] The on-screen \nbrightness and volume controls that still grace macOS today are \nthere largely because of the AppleVision product, though an \nearlier form of them showed up on a 14” CRT just prior. Also, \nDigitalColor Meter (now styled as “Digital Color Meter”) came out \nof that software effort as well. </p>\n\n<p>But the AppleVision displays were, despite a huge amount of \ninnovation, extremely unreliable. It was the first time Apple had \nattempted to build a multiscan CRT on their own, and it turns out \nthat multiscan CRTs are really, <em>really</em> hard to get right. Apple \ntook a large (for the time, in the mid 90s) financial hit on the \nAppleVision 1710 and 1710av, in particular. The name was \neventually abandoned as it had been tarnished beyond usefulness. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/25/applevision\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"328b52029a332ab2cbe865a59f8f8329496c4c4417cc4e6e089d9f59d9554124","category":"Tech"}
