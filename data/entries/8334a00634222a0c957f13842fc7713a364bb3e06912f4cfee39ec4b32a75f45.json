The new updates come over a month after Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-releases-ios-18-1/\">released iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nThe new software can be downloaded on eligible iPhones and iPads over-the-air by going to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2 introduce new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> features, including the first image generation capabilities. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/\">Image Playground</a> is a new app for creating images based on text descriptions, and you can add all kinds of costumes, items, backgrounds and more. You can even make your images look like your friends and family members.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a> is similar to ‌Image Playground‌, but it's for creating custom emoji characters that you can use in Messages.
