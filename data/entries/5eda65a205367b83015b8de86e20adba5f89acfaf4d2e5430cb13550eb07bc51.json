A processional run-in got things underway in now traditional fashion before the peloton hit the first of eight laps finishing on the Champs-Élysées. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A series of determined attacks started immediately after the first passage of the finish line, but they were easily controlled by the sprint teams. The bunch gallop was a bit messy in the end, and it was Van Aert who came out on top, adding a sprint to his mountain and time trial stage wins at this year’s Tour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Fenix) finished second and Mark Cavendish (Deceuninck-QuickStep) settled for third after finding himself out of position on the finishing straight. Though he was unable to break Eddy Merckx’s record, Cavendish does win the points classification for the second time in his career, ten years after his first green jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as taking overall victory, Pogačar also wrapped up his lead in the best young rider and mountains classifications, and he’d be joined on the podium by Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) and Richard Carapaz (Ineos Grenadiers) who confirmed second and third overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n    <div>\n\t\t            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTour de France (2.UWT)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t                            <span>Chatou → Paris Champs-Élysées</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t                    </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=256340\">Full\n                                results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                        <img />\n\t\t\t\t\t                </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>1</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">VAN AERT Wout</a>\n                                            <span>Team Jumbo-Visma</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>02:39:37</time>\n                                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>2</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">PHILIPSEN Jasper</a>\n                                            <span>Alpecin-Fenix</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:00:00</time>\n                                </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>3</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">CAVENDISH Mark</a>\n                                            <span>Deceuninck -
