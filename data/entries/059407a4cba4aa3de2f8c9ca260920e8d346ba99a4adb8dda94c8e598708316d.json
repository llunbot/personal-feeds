But could the intergalactic warlord have managed to snap his fingers at all while wearing that cumbersome metal Infinity Glove? That question inspired a new paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, exploring the biomechanics of the finger snap, particularly the role of friction.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for <em>Infinity War</em> below.)</strong></p>\n<p>\"For the past few years, I've been fascinated with how we can snap our fingers,\" <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/934621\">said co-author Saad Bhamla</a>, an engineer at Georgia Tech. \"It's really an extraordinary physics puzzle right at our fingertips that hasn't been investigated closely.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812958#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812958&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"059407a4cba4aa3de2f8c9ca260920e8d346ba99a4adb8dda94c8e598708316d","category":"Tech"}
