But if you don’t mind trading in your previous device then you can make a decent saving on the cost of its replacement. We explain how Apple trade in works and why it’s something you should definitely consider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also look at some of the alternative trade in services, since it’s not only Apple who accepts an old iPhone, Mac, iPad or Apple Watch in exchange for a new one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update May 31, 2023: </strong></em>Apple is said to be planning to start accepting trade-ins of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1935502/apple-trade-in-mac-studio-13-inch-m2-macbook-air-pro.html\">Mac Studio, 13-inch M2 MacBook Air and 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro </a>on June 5 (the day of the WWDC 2023 keynote), according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.  Currently if you try to trade-in an 2022 M2 MacBook Pro, for example, you are unable to. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What devices can I trade-in at Apple?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple trade-ins cover a wide variety of devices, including iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple doesn’t take iPods or Apple TVs, but it will recycle them for you for free. In fact, Apple says: “You can take your old small electronic equipment such as smartphones, tablets, computers or batteries to any Apple Store and we’ll recycle them responsibly and free of charge.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How much do you get for trading in an old device with Apple?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On May 4, 2023 Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1809179/apple-trade-in-values-increase-iphones-ipads-macs.html\">increased the trade-in values</a> for some iPhones, iPads and Macs, but in many case the trade-in price decreased. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you might expect, the amount on offer varies depending on the device you want to trade. The newer the product, and the better its condition, the more you can expect to get for it. Obviously, if your device is a few years old it’s likely it’s condition won’t be so great and you won’t get as much money for it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get money for trading in an old Mac, iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch. Trade in an old MacBook Pro and you could save as much as $730/£615, an old iPad Pro could save you up to $445/£490, and an Apple Watch Series 7 could get you $165/£145 credit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the US you can even get up to $305 if you trade in an old Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. Apple also offers trade in on other Android devices from a variety of manufacturers, such as Samsung, Google and Huawei, although at the time of writing tablets, PCs and other smartwatches were only available for recycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can check the latest trade-in prices on <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-676245-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/trade-in\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s U.S. website here</a> and the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-676245-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/trade-in\" target=\"_blank\">U.K. Apple site here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just be aware that this is a trade-in deal, so you won’t get any cash in exchange for your old device. Instead, Apple will either credit the amount against a new purchase or give you an Apple gift card of the same value.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How much does Apple give for old iPhones?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As of May 4, 2023 you can save up to $630/£549 on the price of a new Apple product if you exchange an iPhone 13 Pro Max, while switching an aging iPhone 7 will save up to $40/£40. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Model</strong></th><th>New max value</th><th>Old max value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ Max</td><td>$630/£590</td><td>$600/£580</td></tr><tr><td>‌iPhone 13 Pro</td><td>$530/£510</td><td>$500/£500</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 13</td><td>$400/£390</td><td>No change (NC)</td></tr><tr><td>‌iPhone 13‌ mini</td><td>$330/£335</td><td>$350/£330</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone SE (3rd gen)</td><td>$160/£180</td><td>NC</td></tr><tr><td>‌iPhone 12 Pro Max‌</td><td>$440/£390</td><td>$420/£405</td></tr><tr><td>‌iPhone 12‌ Pro</td><td>$350/£350</td><td>$330/NC</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 12‌</td><td>$300/£290</td><td>NC</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 12 mini</td><td>$220/£220</td><td>$250/£235</td></tr><tr><td>‌iPhone SE‌ (2nd gen)</td><td>$90/£105</td><td>$100/£110</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 11 Pro Max</td><td>$280/£285</td><td>NC/£290</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone‌ 11 Pro</td><td>$240/£240</td><td>$230/NC</td></tr><tr><td>‌iPhone‌ 11</td><td>$200/£195</td><td>NC/£205</td></tr><tr><td>‌iPhone‌ XS Max</td><td>$200/£175</td><td>NC/£185</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone‌ XS</td><td>$160/£140</td><td>NC</td></tr><tr><td>‌iPhone‌ XR</td><td>$150/£135</td><td>NC/£140</td></tr><tr><td>‌iPhone‌ X</td><td>$130/£110</td><td>NC</td></tr><tr><td>‌iPhone‌ 8 Plus</td><td>$100/£100</td><td>NC/£105</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone‌ 8</td><td>$75/£80</td><td>NC/£80</td></tr><tr><td>‌iPhone‌ 7 Plus</td><td>$60/£50</td><td>NC</td></tr><tr><td>‌iPhone‌ 7</td><td>$40/£40</td><td>NC</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How much does Apple give for old iPads?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As of May 4, 2023 you can save up to $470/£515 on the price of a new Apple product if you exchange an iPad Pro, while switching an iPad will save up to $175/£165.

The first is to take your device into an Apple store, where it will be assessed to see that it matches the condition you described when getting the quote. If so, you will be given the appropriate credit to use against a new purchase in the store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other is to agree to the quote online and then be sent a shipping pack which allows you to safely send your device to Apple who will check that it matches your description. This process usually takes two to three weeks, and if everything goes well you’ll receive a notification of the credit. Should the device be found to be in a lower condition then described, you’ll be offered a new quote which you can either accept or request that the device be returned to you free of charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is Apple trade in safe?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has one of the highest reputations of any retailer, so you can be sure you’ll get excellent customer service and have any problems dealt with immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can I trade in two iPhones at Apple? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, Apple allows you to trade in multiple devices all of which can go towards the cost of a new one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trade in Apple products at other resellers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple isn’t the only company that wants to buy your old iPhones, iPads, Macs and other devices. There are a number of services that will happily purchase your unwanted tech, with the advantage but you can get money rather than credit at the Apple store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.S. try <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=8053&amp;awinaffid=531979&amp;clickref=1-1-676245-1-0-0&amp;ued=https://www.decluttr.com/start-selling/\" target=\"_blank\">Decluttr</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.gazelle.com&amp;xcust=1-1-676245-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Gazelle</a>, or <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://swappa.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-676245-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Swappa</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.K. try resellers like  <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.stormfront.co.uk/&amp;xcust=1-1-676245-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Stormfront</a>,  <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.smartfonestore.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-676245-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">SmartFoneStore</a>,  <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5792&amp;awinaffid=531979&amp;clickref=1-1-676245-1-0-0&amp;ued=https://www.musicmagpie.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">musicMagpie</a>,  <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.fonebank.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-676245-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Fonebank,</a> and <a href=\"https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p=277729&amp;a=1538920&amp;epi=1-1-676245-1-0-0&amp;url=https://www.krcs.co.uk/trade-in\" target=\"_blank\">KRCS</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All follow a similar process to that of Apple, with quotes being offered in lieu all the devices meeting the conditions described.
