Be it backpacking or a bike tour, this common hack was popularized by lore in these circles, passed down from lightweight traveler to newcomer for decades. Well, Zpacks just upped that weight weenie ante by manufacturing a toothbrush head, called the <a href=\"https://zpacks.com/products/trailbrush-w-5g-colgate-toothpaste\" target=\"_blank\">Trailbrush</a> ($7.95) that pops into the head of a Toaks titanium <a href=\"https://zpacks.com/products/titanium-long-handle-spoon\">long-handle spoon</a>, <a href=\"https://zpacks.com/products/titanium-short-handle-spoon\">short-handle spoon</a>, spork, or fork, multi-purposing the spoon into a tooth brush. Neat. They’ll even throw in a teeny airline tube of Colgate for ya.
