In it, a support representative states \nthat Google “doesn’t have any repair centers or service \ncenters” for the device. </p>\n\n<p>“At this moment, we don’t have any repair option for the Google \nPixel Watch. If your watch is damaged, you can contact the \nGoogle Pixel Watch Customer Support Team to check your \nreplacement options,” Google spokesperson Bridget Starkey \nconfirmed to The Verge. [...]</p>\n\n<p>That warranty leaves owners on their own to deal with damage \ncaused by drops or accidental strikes, and according to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fus%2Fmagazine%2Fpreferred_care%3Fpli%3D1%26hl%3Den-US&amp;xcust=___vg__p_23638322__t_w__d_D\">Google’s \nStore</a>, there is no option for an extended warranty to go \nwith a Pixel Watch. If your Pixel Watch is accidentally damaged, \nthat’s it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Google is not serious about hardware. It’s that simple. I hope someday they get serious.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/21/google-cracked\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1d6acbca5718c73b9b9361ec7c4c7a4349c04c1004610f3212f60d2cb9f05103","category":"Tech"}
