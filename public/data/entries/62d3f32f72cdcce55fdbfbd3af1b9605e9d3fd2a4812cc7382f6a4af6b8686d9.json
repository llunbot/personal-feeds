The socks certainly deliver on both of those fronts.</p>\n<p>However, the sizing is a little confusing. Our tester opted for the L/XL, meant for shoe sizes 9-11. The socks were disproportionately long in the foot, which meant having to compromise on the fit to allow the ankle of the sock to sit in its correct position.</p>\n<p>Luckily, this sizing quirk doesn’t translate to real-world conditions. At £25, these lightweight socks aren’t cheap, but they are 80 per cent merino.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>Giro Comp Racer High Rise socks</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Comp Racer High Rise cycling socks use Coolmax fabric that’s designed to keep your feet dry.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>These 6in socks are a modern take on a classic design, with Coolmax fabric helping to keep your feet dry and comfortable while wicking away moisture.
