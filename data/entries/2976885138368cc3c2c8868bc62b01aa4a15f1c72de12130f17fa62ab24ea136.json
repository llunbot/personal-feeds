Read more below…</em><span></span></p>\n<p>Hi! My name is Jared (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/southernwonders/\" target=\"_blank\">@southernwonders</a>). Many of you know that I live in central North Carolina and am incredibly proud to be a local in the state I’ve called home for nearly 30 years. As a cyclist, mountain biker, hiker, camper, and outdoor enthusiast, visiting the western part of the state to explore and have fun has been a sacred experience. Anytime I have friends in town, especially biking friends, that’s where I take them. Some of you have had the pleasure of visiting and riding in Appalachia, and I hope you hold those memories fondly.</p>\n<p>On September 26th, Hurricane Helene moved inland, dumping close to three feet of rain on the mountains of western NC in a single day. This caused rivers to rise well above their normal levels, devastating small, rural mountain towns and the city of Asheville. These communities, which have hosted so many wonderful experiences and are home to industry giants like Industry Nine, Fox, Cane Creek, Rockgeist, and DeFeet, have been cut off from the world. They have no power, water, cell service, and most of the main highways in and out of the area have collapsed due to flooding or landslides.</p>\n<p>I’m asking you to consider donating $20, or more if you have it, to this <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/its-time-to-lift-up-asheville-and-wnc\" target=\"_blank\">GoFundMe</a>, which I will give to <a href=\"https://belovedasheville.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Beloved Asheville</a>, a local nonprofit that’s on the ground distributing aid in the city right now.</p>\n<p><em>Photo via <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-asheville-f02869c7d01e68f2d7f0553abb82252f\" target=\"_blank\">AP</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/southern-wonders-gofundme-to-help-western-north-carolinas-hurricane-helene-victims/\">Southern Wonders GoFundMe to Help Western North Carolina’s Hurricane Helene Victims</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"2976885138368cc3c2c8868bc62b01aa4a15f1c72de12130f17fa62ab24ea136","category":"Cycling"}
