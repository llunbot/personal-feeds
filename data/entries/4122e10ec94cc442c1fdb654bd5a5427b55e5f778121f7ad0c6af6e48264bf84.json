It’s the material that kick-started the industrial revolution and gave birth to the modern age. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an era of space travel and smartphones, why would you want a bike made from anything other than carbon fibre? Put simply, because it’s fun to be different and while there are drawbacks, steel has a unique charm and some real-world advantages over other frame materials. Let’s break it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews of the best steel road bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>All-City Zig Zag: RRP £1,300 –<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/all-city-zig-zag-review\"> <strong><strong>Read our full review</strong></strong></a><strong><strong> </strong></strong></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cinelli Nemo Tig: RRP £2.049 (frameset) –<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cinelli-nemo-tig-review\"> Read our full review </a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Condor Super Acciaio: RRP £1,700 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/condor-super-acciaio-disc-review\">Read our full review</a> </strong>  </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fairlight Strael: RRP from £1,399 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fairlight-strael-review\">Read our full review</a>  </strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Genesis Equilibrium Disc: RRP £2,699 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/genesis-equilibrium-disc-road-bike-review\">Read our full review</a> </strong> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mason Resolution: <strong>RRP £1,595 –</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/mason-resolution-review-2\">Read our full review</a> </strong> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ritchey Road Logic: <strong>RRP £1359.99 –</strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ritchey-road-logic-review\"><strong>Read our full review </strong> </a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ritte Phantom Steel:</strong><a href=\"https://ritte.cc/products/the-phantom\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> </strong></a><strong>RRP £2,137 <strong>–</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ritte-phantom-review\">Read our full review </a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stayer Crit: RRP £2,200 <strong>–</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/stayer-crit-review\">Read our full review </a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Standert Pfadfinder: RRP £4,600 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/standert-pfadfinder-bike-review\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Keeping reading for full details of all these bikes</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Are steel bikes comfortable?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/02163205/all-city_zig_zag_review_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"all-city_zig_zag_review_1\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Steel bikes can be very comfortable but you should be wary of generalisations, as there’s a lot more to a bike’s personality than just its frame material.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steel comes in many grades and variants but it’s overall a comparatively hard and stiff material. Good quality steel frames use carefully chosen tube profiles to target stiffness and flexibility where it’s needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Butting – where tubing varies in wall thickness along its length – allows bike makers to place more material where strength is required, and less where it’s not, to save weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One reason some riders love steel is because it doesn’t ride quite like anything else. It’s not magic, but steel has a distinct character that’s simply different to aluminium or carbon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steel bikes do tend to be strong and resistant to damage and, with care, they will usually last a lifetime. Although you’re unlikely to see one at the Tour de France, steel can also still form the heart of a proper racing bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+2\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'get the magazine for people who love cycling, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are steel bikes heavy? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02173907/uci-weight-limit-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Bike weighing scale showing 6.8kg\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the exception of some one-off custom designs, steel bikes are always heavier than what you might expect from an equivalent aluminium or carbon bike, but don’t let that put you off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good quality steel road frame will weigh around 2kg, give or take a bit, in other words a good kilo more than a pretty average carbon frame. Many steel frames are also matched to steel forks, widening the gap even further. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neverthless, it’s possible to build up a respectably light steel bike using premium components, even coming close to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-weight-limit\">6.8kg UCI minimum weight limit</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, a bike doesn’t have to be ultra-light to be a joy to ride.

Between us we’ve reviewed bikes from every mainstream manufacturer plus countless smaller brands, covering everything from the entry level to the truly premium. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve ridden every bike on this list, heading out in all weathers on roads we know well to decide if they’re up to scratch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s a £500 commuter or a £12,000 superbike, we bring a critical eye to our reviews, and we prize bikes that combine good design with everyday usability and, above all, fun. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on for our favourite steel road bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best steel road bikes reviewed by Cyclist’s experts</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>All-City Zig Zag</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/01/03073812/all-city_zig_zag_review_3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"all-city_zig_zag_review_3\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£1,600 (frameset) | <a href=\"https://www.swinnertoncycles.co.uk/all-city-bikes-road-bikes-zig-zag-frameset-p114416?clickref=1101lyjAVgd7&amp;utm_source=VisualsoftAffiliates&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=skimlinks_phg\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros: Decent weight for built bikes, 35mm tyre clearance</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cons: All City brand being wound down, limited availability</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Highlights: 30mm tyres, clearance for mudguards, rack mounts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The All-City Zig Zag is a versatile steel road bike designed in the United States and manufactured in the Far East. It relies on generous tyre clearances and aggressive geometry for a fun riding experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using custom-created tubing, even when built up with a modest component list of Shimano 105 groupset, alloy Halo Devaura wheels and alloy Genetic finishing kit, this is still a bike that clocks in at a respectable 9.4kg. Obviously, this won’t be troubling machines with carbon frames, but it’s pretty impressive considering the versatility and robustness on offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our test bike was rolling on broad 30mm tubeless Schwalbe Pro One tyres and it was supple and smooth. There’s clearance for wider 35mm tyres along with eyelets for racks and mudguards, so it’ll take to rougher terrain too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a comfortable riding position and slightly longer than average wheelbase, the Zig Zag is happy to try its hand at other activities. It’s never so upright as to be lifeless and so always provides a nice mix of speed and stability. Better yet, it comes in some fabulous paintjobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zig Zag is currently available as a frameset only in the UK.

On the face of it, these attributes, allied to a 105 groupset and decent tyres, are a recipe for success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Featuring a pronounced sloping top tube, the frame itself is constructed of Reynolds 725 tubing and butted to create strength where it’s needed and save weight where it’s not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A slack head angle gives a predictable rate of turn-in and contributes to a sensation of being utterly planted to the road at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it’s not a touring bike, it can do a decent impression of one if that’s what you want thanks to mounts and multi-terrain capable 30mm WTB Exposure tyres. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full Shimano 105 groupset with hydraulic brakes means shifting and stopping is also uber-reliable, and the gearing range is generous too. There’s a rim brake option available that shaves a bit off the pricetag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a touch over 10kg, there’s no getting away from the Equilibrium’s weight.
