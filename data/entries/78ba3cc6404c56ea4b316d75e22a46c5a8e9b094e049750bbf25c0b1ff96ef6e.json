After holding to hover at 500 meters and then 50 meters altitude, SLIM pulsed its engines to fine-tune its vertical descent before touching down at 10:20 am EST (15:20 UTC).</p>\n<p>The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), which manages the SLIM mission, streamed the landing live on YouTube. But the stream of updates stopped after SLIM's landing, and the webcast hosts did not provide any update on the status of the spacecraft before ending live coverage about 10 minutes later.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997302#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997302&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"78ba3cc6404c56ea4b316d75e22a46c5a8e9b094e049750bbf25c0b1ff96ef6e","category":"Tech"}
