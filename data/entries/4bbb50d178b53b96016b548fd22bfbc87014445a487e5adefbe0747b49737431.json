But firm rubber mounts add some space between it and the bar so it won’t take up hand positions and will clear drop bars better.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osprey-prototype-bikepacking-frame-saddle-handlebar-top-tube-bags-07.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osprey-prototype-bikepacking-frame-saddle-handlebar-top-tube-bags-07-800x296.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype osprey bikepacking bags\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osprey-prototype-bikepacking-frame-saddle-handlebar-top-tube-bags-07-800x296.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osprey-prototype-bikepacking-frame-saddle-handlebar-top-tube-bags-07-297x110.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osprey-prototype-bikepacking-frame-saddle-handlebar-top-tube-bags-07-120x44.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osprey-prototype-bikepacking-frame-saddle-handlebar-top-tube-bags-07-768x284.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osprey-prototype-bikepacking-frame-saddle-handlebar-top-tube-bags-07-1536x567.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/osprey-prototype-bikepacking-frame-saddle-handlebar-top-tube-bags-07.jpg 2030w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The saddle bag gets a wrapper that mounts to the saddle and post with a very wide, secure Velcro strap around the post to help stabilize it. The roll-top dry bag then slots into it and secures with a strap running around the back, through the roll-top’s closure, so it won’t come out. Plenty of compression points and a one-way air valve help you get it packed tight. It should be big enough to hold a one-person bikepacking tent and some clothes. No word on pricing or ship dates yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cedaero fork bag and custom frame bags</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
