While the ‌iPad Air‌ will retain a 10.9-inch display, the ‌iPad mini‌'s screen will grow from 8.3- to 8.7-inches in size. In 2027, Apple will bring OLED display technology to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-working-on-larger-ipad-air/\">rumored 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> model, which is expected to debut with an LCD display <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/\">early next year</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple apparently plans to use a low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) OLED panel for the ‌iPad Pro‌ and a single-stack low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) panel for the ‌iPad mini‌ and ‌iPad Air‌, meaning that ProMotion for refresh rates up to 120Hz will continue to be exclusive to the high-end models. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2027, Apple will upgrade the ‌iPad Pro‌'s OLED panels to a next-generation panel with improved light efficiency via Color Filter on Encapsulation (CoE), which is said to reduce power consumption by around 20%. Use of a color filter could also enable Apple to implement under-display camera technology on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> for the first time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2025, Apple will purportedly bring OLED to the 16-inch MacBook Pro, followed by the 14-inch model in 2026. The 13- and 15-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> models will also transition from LCD to OLED in 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBenefits of OLED include increased brightness, higher contrast ratio, greater color accuracy, and lower power consumption compared to existing models with LCD panels. Apple already uses OLED displays for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and Apple Watch models, with the exception of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a>. The report notes that OLED panels are also thinner and lighter than LCDs, which offer particular benefits to the ‌iPad‌. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/etnews-com/\">ETNews</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/\">OLED iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-plans-to-bring-oled-to-nine-new-devices/\">Report: Apple Plans to Bring OLED to Nine New Devices By 2027</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-plans-to-bring-oled-to-nine-new-devices-by-2027.2411257/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2d399c7a2f1f70b72bf6264ba31c5d1b55d72e0eb2622784d6d903f76a4da897","category":"Apple"}
