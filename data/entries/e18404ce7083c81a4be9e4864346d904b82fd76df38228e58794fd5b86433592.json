Together the pair represents nine years of development and testing. Wove firmly stands by its claim that these are the most comfortable, lightweight, and strongest saddles on the market today. After laying hands on them and listening to the custom tuneable grip and padding options (including replaceable padding), I was eager to check one out. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-ride.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-ride-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Wove saddle group ride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-ride-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-ride-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-ride-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-ride-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-ride-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-ride.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who are Wove Saddles?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For those unfamiliar, Wove is a high-end performance bicycle saddle company. They offer handmade lightweight carbon saddles manufactured in the USA. The saddles are performance-focused, aimed at comfort, speed, and neck-snapping looks. Wove is focused on rider comfort in any position, at any speed — because comfortable is fast. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-MAGS-road-Gravel-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"491\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-MAGS-road-Gravel--800x491.jpeg\" alt=\"Wove saddle group MAGS road Gravel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-MAGS-road-Gravel--800x491.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-MAGS-road-Gravel--297x182.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-MAGS-road-Gravel--120x74.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-MAGS-road-Gravel--768x471.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-MAGS-road-Gravel-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wove Mags Saddle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wove Mags is a road and gravel saddle; it’s lightweight (like sub 130g) with a one-piece carbon shell and rail construction. Fit-wise, the Mags has a nice perch to allow riders cozy up on the 146mm wide rear for all-day comfort with no thigh rubbing. For those that migrate to the front of the saddle during efforts, the 30.5mm nose offers solid pedaling comfort with no soft tissue pressure. The padding is hard to describe, but it’s a firm shock-absorbing feel with a plush outer layer — very impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-Mags-details-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"439\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-Mags-details--800x439.jpeg\" alt=\"Wove saddle Mags details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-Mags-details--800x439.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-Mags-details--297x163.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-Mags-details--120x66.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-Mags-details--768x421.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-Mags-details-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wove Mags is available in two different cover materials; grippy (V8 TT, non-slip grip) and Standard, with a light tack but better for slight movement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: $595</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-V8-TT-Tri-saddle-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"553\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-V8-TT-Tri-saddle--800x553.jpeg\" alt=\"Wove saddle V8 TT Tri saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-V8-TT-Tri-saddle--800x553.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-V8-TT-Tri-saddle--297x205.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-V8-TT-Tri-saddle--120x83.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-V8-TT-Tri-saddle--768x530.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-V8-TT-Tri-saddle-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wove V8 Saddle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wove V8 is the first Wove saddle that caught our eye and is still on my “must try” list. The V8 is the TT and Tri-focused Wove saddle; it comes in around 140g with a slight box-ish shape. Wove prides itself on the shape of the V8 and claims it exhibits no soft tissue pressure and no thigh rubbing when riding out on the nose of the saddle. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-V8-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"439\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-V8--800x439.jpeg\" alt=\"Wove saddle V8\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-V8--800x439.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-V8--297x163.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-V8--120x66.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-V8--768x421.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-V8-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wove made the cover material on the V8 grippy to hold the rider in place while in the aero bars. The padding is similar to the Mag but has slightly more depth in the nose of the saddle. Just enough padding to sink in and hit your numbers.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: $595</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-attachment.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-attachment-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Wove saddle attachment\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-attachment-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-attachment-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-attachment-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-attachment-768x511.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-attachment-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-attachment.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-mounting-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-mounting--800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Wove saddle group mounting\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-mounting--800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-mounting--297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-mounting--120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-mounting--768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-mounting--720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wove-saddle-group-mounting-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is the Wove V8 UCI legal? </strong>The Wove V8 measures 30cm long, making it UCI-legal.
