It typically isn’t possible to adjust the preload of a cartridge bearing (although there are some exceptions) and when it wears out, the cartridge typically requires replacement.</p>\n<p>The majority of wheel manufacturers use sealed bearings in their hubs, with Shimano being the major hold-out and advocate of cup-and-cone hubs.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo also uses them on some of its wheelsets, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/campagnolo-shamal-c21-db-2wf-xdr-carbon-wheelset-review/\">Shamal</a>, although it used cartridge bearings on some of its other products.</p>\n<p>That Shimano is now embracing sealed bearings on three of the four hubs signals a radical departure for the brand.</p>\n<h2>Shimano cartridge bearing hub range</h2>\n<p>There are four options in Shimano’s new range, with the brand describing them as “versatile and reliable mid-range hub sets”.</p>\n<h3>Shimano TC600 hub</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The TC600 hub heads up the range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>The TC600 hub sits at the top of the range and is designed for use with thru-axles (denoted by the ‘TC’ moniker in the product code).</p>\n<p>It uses a modular axle and Shimano says you can quickly and easily change between Microspline and HG <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/freehubs/\">freehub</a> bodies.</p>\n<p>The TC600 uses twin double-row cartridge bearings and an additional labyrinth seal on the outside of the hub shell.</p>\n<p>Labyrinth seals are designed to prevent contaminants entering the hub shell, which should improve bearing life.</p>\n<p>The TC600 hub has an anodised finish and is said to offer 10 degrees of engagement.</p>\n<h3>Shimano TC500 / QC500</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The TC500 is the second-rung hub in the range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>The second-rung TC500 / QC500 hub also uses cartridge bearings and can be converted between quick-release and thru-axles.</p>\n<p>It also uses a labyrinth seal and can be changed swiftly between Microspline and HG freehub bodies.</p>\n<p>It too has an anodised finish, albeit with 15 degrees of engagement.</p>\n<h3>Shimano QC400</h3>\n<p>The QC400 is only compatible with quick-release axles and steps down to a painted finish on the hub shell.It has 22.5 degrees of engagement.</p>\n<p>Shimano says the hub uses cup-and-cone bearings in the ‘outer body bearing’. We assume this means cup-and-cone bearings are used in the freehub, but we have contacted Shimano for confirmation.</p>\n<h3>Shimano QC300</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The QC300 is the only hub in the range to use cup-and-cone bearings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>The QC300 represents the entry point to the new hub range and Shimano likens it to its budget Tourney components.</p>\n<p>It uses cup-and-cone bearings and is compatible with quick-release axles. Shimano also says the hub is compatible with 15mm nutted axles.</p>\n<p>Like the QC400, it uses a painted hub finish and offers 22.5 degrees of engagement.</p>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"23e20f43345d41ad2d3fbf3dcb5041abbd4d949ee5e0f45a1895564120f52c02","category":"Cycling"}
