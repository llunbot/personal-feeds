{"title":"MacRumors: ‘M1 vs. M3 vs. M4 iMac Buyer’s Guide’","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-vs-m3-vs-m4-imac/","date":1730228515000,"content":"\n<p>Hartley Charlton, MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The 2021 and 2023 iMacs have now been discontinued by Apple and\nprices at third-party resellers are falling. As such, some\ncustomers may be weighing up whether to pick up a 2021 or 2023\niMac instead of the latest model, while some existing iMac users\nmay be wondering if it’s now time to upgrade to the M4 model.</p>\n\n<p>The three Apple silicon iMac models share the overwhelming\nmajority of their features, so should you consider buying or\nsticking with the first- or second-generation models to save\nmoney? This breakdown also serves as a way to see all the\ndifferences that the 2024 iMac brings to the table.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Super-useful comparison table of what changed between the M1, M3, and now M4 revisions.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s own ever-handy “Compare” tool on the iMac website is useful too. <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/imac/compare/?modelList=iMac-24-M4_2,iMac-24-M4_4,iMac-24-M3_4\">Here’s a comparison</a> between the new M4 2-port and 4-port models, alongside last year’s 4-port M3 model. One difference: the entry-priced $1,300 2-port model, which has an 8-core CPU (rather than 10-core), ships with a Magic Keyboard that doesn’t have a Touch ID button; all of the 4-port/10-core configurations ship with a Touch-ID–equipped keyboard. Apple charges $150 for the Magic Keyboard With Touch ID and $100 for the one with a “lock button” instead; the bigger one with a numeric keypad is $180. Also, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/mac/accessories/mice-keyboards\">the new USB-C keyboards, mice, and trackpads</a> are only available in white or black — the only way to get the color-matching models is to buy an iMac.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/29/m1-m3-m4-imac-comparison-buyers-guide\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dc5c71da0af931f4afcbef05fc383a41277b08daa2340f72019996a927bdf1a3","category":"Tech"}
