On Monday, the US automaker filled in the rest of the gaps with its Q2 financial disclosure. Q2's deliveries were a record for Tesla, earning the company $1.1 billion in profit. Tesla ended Q2 2021 with $619 million in free cash flow and $16.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents.</p>\n<p>Tesla said in its <a href=\"https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline;filename=\">presentation to investors</a> that its output and deliveries were significant factors in the profitable quarter. The company also said it successfully launched <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/autonomous-driving/tesla-full-self-driving-feature-monthly-subscription-a7568042991/\">a subscription to its highly controversial FSD feature</a>, where owners can pay $199 per month for the driving assist feature as opposed to a single payment of $10,000. And regulatory credits made a much smaller contribution to the bottom line in Q2 at just $354 million.</p>\n<p>We reported <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/tesla-has-great-quarter-delivers-more-than-200000-evs/\">Tesla's Q2 production results</a> when they were announced several weeks ago, but to recap: the company built 2,340 Models S and X and delivered 1,890 of them, 18 percent of which were leased. The cheaper mass-market Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover did the heavy lifting in Q2. Tesla built 204,081 of these models, delivering 199,360 of them. (Seven percent of Models 3 and Y were leased.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783145#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783145&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
