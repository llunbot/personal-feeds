Gilmour's three-stage rocket, named Eris, could launch at any time during a 10-hour window Thursday, local time. In the United States, the launch window runs from 5:30 pm EDT Wednesday until 3:30 am EDT Thursday.</p>\n<p>The debut launch of Gilmour's Eris rocket is purely a test flight. Gilmour has tested the rocket's engines and rehearsed the countdown last year, loading propellant and getting within 10 seconds of launch. But Gilmour cautioned in a post on LinkedIn early Wednesday that \"test launches are complex.\" Gilmour added on social media that \"weather, systems checks, or technical issues may delay the flightâ€”sometimes by hours, days, or longer.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/for-the-first-time-an-australian-rocket-will-take-aim-at-low-earth-orbit/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/for-the-first-time-an-australian-rocket-will-take-aim-at-low-earth-orbit/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6a19ca10f4c9a7369d83b69244932b90a30486bbb42cd1b79d0b80b148069f17","category":"Tech"}
