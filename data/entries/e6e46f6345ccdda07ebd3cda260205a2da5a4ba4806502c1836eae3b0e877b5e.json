But in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/11/apple-seeds-ios-17-beta-3-update/\">updated iOS 17 developer beta 3</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/12/apple-releases-ios-17-public-beta/\">new public beta</a>, Apple has now added a \"Save to Photos\" option to the Full Page screenshot interface for added flexibility. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new option also appears in the latest beta versions of iPadOS 17 and macOS Sonoma. The ability to save \"scrolling screenshots\" as images has been available on Android devices for a while now, but iPhone users have had to use third-party apps like <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tailor-screenshot-stitching/id926653095\">Tailor</a> to achieve the same thing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn another notable addition spotted by <em><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/12/apple-introduces-bilingual-siri-and-a-full-page-screenshot-feature-with-ios-17/\">TechCrunch</a></em>, users are also getting better dual-SIM support, with the ability to sort messages based on SIM, separate ringtones for each SIM, and the ability to choose a SIMÂ when calling back an unknown number.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPublic beta testers who have <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\">signed up for Apple's beta testing program</a> can download the iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma updates now. Apple is expected to release final stable versions of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma later in the fall.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/13/ios-17-beta-save-full-page-screenshot-image/\">Latest iOS 17 Beta Includes 'Save to Photos' Option in Full-Page Screenshot Interface, Better Dual-SIM Support</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-ios-17-beta-includes-save-to-photos-option-in-full-page-screenshot-interface-better-dual-sim-support.2395786/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e6e46f6345ccdda07ebd3cda260205a2da5a4ba4806502c1836eae3b0e877b5e","category":"Apple"}
