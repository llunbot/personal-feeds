That looks to be the case with the new Cosmic S carbon wheels from Mavic. They are the first Mavic Cosmic Carbon wheels to enter the market under $1000 ($999), and they carry over the attributes of their pricy brethren. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"7772\" height=\"5184\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42--jpg.webp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42--jpg.webp 7772w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(All photos: Mavic)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mavic Cosmic S Carbon Wheelset </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbon wheels are becoming more “affordable” and also transferring some pretty high-tech gains. Mavic is looking to capitalize on the growing market for less pricey performance carbon wheels. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-windtunnel--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-windtunnel--jpg.webp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-windtunnel--jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-windtunnel--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-windtunnel--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-windtunnel--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-windtunnel--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-windtunnel--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-windtunnel--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the industry heavy hitters have already staked a claim in this growing market: Roval (Rapide 38 C), Trek (Bontrager Aeolus Elite 35 TLR), Hunt (40 Carbon), and Zipps (303s). Most, if not all, of these wheels are under $1000 and offer a solid build with a high-end “partner” for those looking to upgrade later. What separates those above is the quality of the wheel build, quality of materials, and warranty.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rim-.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rim--1536x1536.png\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rim--1536x1536.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rim--297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rim--120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rim--768x768.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rim--2048x2048.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cosmic S Carbon 42 Rim Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Cosmic S Carbon 42 looks to be a solid all-arounder, with a conservative 21 mm rim width (compared to the newest breed). The wheels come fully tubeless-ready and ship with Mavic UST valves. The rim shape is also slightly conservative, but it uses a well-trusted Mavic design. It’s like a mix of the Cosmic SLR 45 and the SRL 40, but disc-specific. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-free-hub.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-free-hub-1536x1536.png\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-free-hub-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-free-hub-297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-free-hub-120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-free-hub-768x768.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-free-hub-2048x2048.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-hub-.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-hub--1536x1536.png\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-hub--1536x1536.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-hub--297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-hub--120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-hub--768x768.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-hub--2048x2048.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mavic Classic Hub with Instant Drive 360</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The hubs are listed as “Mavic classic hubs” with the Instant Drive 360 (ID360). We’ve used the ID360 on the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mavic-rolls-out-2-all-new-affordable-allroad-wheelsets-for-rough-roads-gravel-dirt/\">Mavic All-Road wheels</a> and their mountain bike designs. The hubs are very easy to service and use an upgradeable tooth system similar to the DT-Ratchet drive. They also use Mavic’s Infinity hubs QRM auto-bearing preload technology, which is another bit of easy maintenance. The hubset is Centerlock, making for a clean look and overall presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hubs arrive with various spacing accommodations, including 135mm QR, making this wheelset a great option for those looking to upgrade an older QR disc road bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rider--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"7735\" height=\"4059\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rider--jpg.webp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rider--jpg.webp 7735w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rider--297x156.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rider--1536x806.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rider--120x63.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rider--768x403.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-Cosmic-S-Carbon-42-rider--2048x1075.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cosmic S Carbon 42 Hub Compatability</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Freewheel: Shimano/Sram, convertible to Campagnolo ED11, N3W, and XD-R with optional driver bodies</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Front axle: 12×100 thru axle, easily convertible to quick release with included adapters.
