Votes happen, fortunes rise and fall, losers become\nwinners, and vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>For all intents and purposes, though, the only part that matters\nis a five-minute sequence toward the end.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m always wary of recency bias, but at the moment I’d put <em>Succession</em> in the hall of fame for the best TV shows ever. Four great seasons, a rich ensemble of vivid memorable characters, never a bad episode, and a truly great finale.</p>\n\n<p>See also: <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-lists/succession-characters-ranked-least-despicable-to-most-hbo-1234736505/roman-roy-1234736560/\">Sepinwall’s ranking of the top 25 characters on Succession, from least to most despicable</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/29/sepinwall-succession-finale\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f6a163c8ce778c5f061d00ca384a798e9bbf302a8a06a74e880182298f91c1cc","category":"Tech"}
