AWS Summits are free technical and business conferences happening in large cities across the planet. This week, we were happy to welcome our customers and partners in Sydney and Paris. In France, 9,973 customers and partners joined us for the day to meet and exchange ideas but also to attend one of the more than 145 technical breakout sessions and the keynote. This is the largest cloud computing event in France, and I can’t resist sharing a picture from the main room during the opening keynote.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/04/07/aws-summit-paris-keynote.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/04/07/aws-summit-paris-keynote.png\" alt=\"AWS Summit Paris keynote\" width=\"800\" height=\"388\" /></a></p> \n<p>There are AWS Summits on all continents ; you can find the list and the links for registration here <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits\">https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits</a>. The next on my agenda are listed at the end of this post.</p> \n<p>These two Summits did not slow down our services teams. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023\">I counted 44 new capabilities since last Monday</a>. Here are the few that caught my attention.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last Week on AWS</strong></span></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/es/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-response-streaming/\"><strong>AWS Lambda response streaming</strong></a> – Response streaming is a new invocation pattern that lets functions progressively stream response payloads back to clients. You can use Lambda response payload streaming to send response data to callers as it becomes available. Response streaming also allows you to build functions that return larger payloads and perform long-running operations while reporting incremental progress (within the 15 minutes execution period). My colleague Julian wrote <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/es/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-response-streaming/\">an incredibly detailed blog post</a> to help you to get started.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-supply-chain-now-generally-available-mitigate-risks-and-lower-costs-with-increased-visibility-and-actionable-insights/\"><strong>AWS Supply Chain Now Generally Available</strong></a> – AWS Supply Chain is a cloud application that mitigates risk and lowers costs with unified data and built-in contextual collaboration. It connects to your existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) and supply chain management systems to bring you ML-powered actionable insights into your supply chain.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/amazon-textract-bulk-document-uploader-test-documents/\"><strong>AWS Service Catalog Supports Terraform Templates</strong></a> – With AWS Service Catalog, you can create, govern, and manage a catalog of infrastructure as code (IaC) templates that are approved for use on AWS. You can now define AWS Service Catalog products and their resources using either <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">AWS CloudFormation</a> or <a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/\">Hashicorp Terraform</a> and choose the tool that better aligns with your processes and expertise.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon S3 <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/amazon-s3-two-security-best-practices-buckets-default/\">enforces two security best practices</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/amazon-s3-visibility-object-replication-status/\">brings new visibility into object replication status</a></strong> – As <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/12/amazon-s3-automatically-enable-block-public-access-disable-access-control-lists-buckets-april-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">announced on December 13, 2022</a>, Amazon S3 is now deploying two new default bucket security settings by automatically enabling S3 Block Public Access and disabling S3 access control lists (ACLs) for all new S3 buckets. Amazon S3 also adds a new Amazon CloudWatch metric that can be used to diagnose and correct S3 Replication configuration issues more quickly. The <code>OperationFailedReplication</code> metric, available in both the Amazon S3 console and in Amazon CloudWatch, gives you per-minute visibility into the number of objects that did not replicate to the destination bucket for each of your replication rules.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/aws-security-hub-4-security-best-practice-controls/\">AWS Security Hub launches four security best practices</a></strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/\" target=\"_blank\">AWS Security Hub</a> has released 4 new controls for its <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/nist-standard.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-53 Rev. 5 standard</a>. These controls conduct fully-automatic security checks against Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Amazon Redshift, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). To use these controls, you should first turn on the NIST standard.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/aws-cloud-operations-competency-partners/\">AWS Cloud Operation Competency Partners</a></strong> – AWS Cloud Operations covers five fundamental solution areas: Cloud Governance, Cloud Financial Management, Monitoring and Observability, Compliance and Auditing, and Operations Management. The new competency enables customers to select validated AWS Partners who offer comprehensive solutions with an integrated approach across multiple areas.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/building-macos-apps-using-amplify-library-for-swift/\"><strong>Amplify Library for Swift on macOS</strong></a> – Amplify is an open-source, client-side library making it easier to access a cloud backend from your front-end application code. It provides language-specific constructs to abstract low-level details of the cloud API. It helps you to integrate services such as analytics, object storage, REST or GraphQL APIs, user authentication, geolocation and mapping, and push notifications. You can now write beautiful macOS applications that connect to the same cloud backend as their iOS counterparts.</p> \n<p><strong>X in Y </strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffbarr/\">Jeff</a> started this section a while ago to list the expansion of new services and capabilities to additional Regions.
