Sky hasn't confirmed the cause of the problem, but a botched update is largely suspected.</p>\n<p>Sky, a Comcast company that sells Internet, mobile, and satellite TV service in the UK, got into the streaming hardware business in 2021. Its proprietary Glass TVs and Stream pucks let people access TV channels offered through Sky via the Internet instead of a dish. As of this writing, Glass TVs range from 600 pounds (about $800) for a 43-inch set to 1,199 pounds (about $1,600) for 65 inches and include <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/tcl-accused-of-selling-quantum-dot-tvs-without-actual-quantum-dots/\">quantum dots</a> and Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HLG HDR support. To order a Glass TV, people have to sign up for a Sky Entertainment subscription that includes the same type of channels offered through Sky's satellite TV services but via streaming, plus Netflix (with or without ads). If you don’t buy/renew your Sky Entertainment subscription, “access to TV apps like Netflix won't be available,” Sky <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/help/articles/sky-glass-without-a-subscription\">says</a>. The Stream puck, meanwhile, supports various streaming apps but doesn't work without a Sky subscription.</p>\n<p>As of yesterday, paying subscribers and owners of Glass and Stream devices reported that their devices were unable to power on. Users reported only being able to see a <a href=\"https://x.com/Coolstorybrotec/status/1837018387693658147\">blank screen</a>, with some saying the problems lasted for hours.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051341#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051341&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d73eeda519d971d0d651bb7876d232c839bd46c2bf03f56d97ef0c20198f6c43","category":"Tech"}
