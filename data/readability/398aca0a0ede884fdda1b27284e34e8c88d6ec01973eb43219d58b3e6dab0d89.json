A six-rider breakaway was finally given some breathing room inside the last 50km, all eyes on the decisive steep ramps still to come.</p><p>With the peloton closing in behind, Audrey Cordon-Ragot (Trek-Segafredo) attacked her breakaway companions with about 11 km to go, and no one could follow. The French rider quickly stretched out a 20-second lead, but Movistar was chasing furiously in the peloton, sweeping up most of the early breakaway in no time. </p><p>As the gradient increased, Van Vleuten was the only rider who looked at all comfortable. Cordon-Ragot enjoyed less than 3 km in the lead before the Movistar rider caught and passed her, never to be seen again. Van Vleuten crossed the line solo, followed 36 seconds later by Ruth Winder (Trek-Segafredo), with breakaway survivor Tatiana Guderzo (Alé BTC Ljubljana) coming in a minute further down to round out the podium.</p><div><div><p>Donostia San Sebastian Klasikoa Women (1.WWT) <span>San Sebastián → San Sebastián</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/df/annemiek-van-vleuten-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"398aca0a0ede884fdda1b27284e34e8c88d6ec01973eb43219d58b3e6dab0d89","category":"Cycling"}
