In addition, the M3 chip brings hardware-accelerated ray tracing to the iPad Air for the first time, providing improved graphics rendering in games. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MDFV4LL/A/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-air-11-inch-m3-us-english\">new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Air</a> features a larger trackpad, and function keys for easy access to features like display brightness and volume controls. The new Magic Keyboard attaches to the iPad Air magnetically, and the Smart Connector immediately connects power and data without the need for Bluetooth. The keyboard is also equipped with a USB-C port in its hinge for pass-through charging of other accessories.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have yet to discover any other changes for the new iPad Air beyond the M3 chip and the updated Magic Keyboard. The new 11-inch and 13-inch models continue to have a 12-megapixel Center Stage front camera, 12-megapixel Wide rear camera, Touch ID power button, USB-C port with up to 10 Gbps data transfer speeds, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.3.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStorage capacities continue to range between 128GB and 1TB, and battery life is unchanged compared to the previous model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence is available on any iPad Air model with the M1 chip or newer.\r<br />\n \r<br />\nThe new iPad Air can be <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air\">pre-ordered starting today</a>, and it will launch on March 12. In the U.S., the 11-inch model continues to start at $599, and the 13-inch model continues to start at $799. The device remains available in the same Space Gray, Starlight, Blue, and Purple color options that were offered for the previous model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Magic Keyboard comes in white.
