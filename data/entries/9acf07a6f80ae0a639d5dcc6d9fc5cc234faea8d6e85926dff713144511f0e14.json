{"title":"Blackmagic Design Now Taking Pre-Orders for Vision-Pro–Optimized Immersive Camera","link":"https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/media/release/20241217-01","date":1734459344000,"content":"\n<p>Blackmagic Design:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Blackmagic Design announced it will start taking pre-orders for\nthe new Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive camera — the world’s first\ncommercial camera system designed to capture Apple Immersive Video\nfor Apple Vision Pro — today with deliveries due to start in\nearly 2025. DaVinci Resolve Studio will be updated to support\nediting Apple Immersive Video early next year, offering\nprofessional filmmakers a comprehensive workflow for producing\nApple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro. Apple Immersive Video\nis a remarkable 180-degree media format that leverages\nultra-high-resolution immersive video and Spatial Audio to place\nviewers in the center of the action. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive features a fixed, custom lens\nsystem pre-installed on the body, which is designed specifically\nto capture Apple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro. The sensor\ndelivers 8160 × 7200 resolution per eye with pixel level\nsynchronization and an incredible 16 stops of dynamic range, so\ncinematographers can shoot 90fps 3D immersive cinema content to a\nsingle file. The custom lens system is designed for URSA Cine’s\nlarge format image sensor with extremely accurate positional data\nthat’s read and stored at time of manufacturing. This immersive\nlens projection data — which is calibrated and stored on device — then travels through post production in the Blackmagic RAW\nfile itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>$30,000 — not cheap, but not crazy. And this isn’t merely 3D in a rectangular frame — it’s 180° 8K 3D.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@_Davidsmith/113666665256122829\">David Smith</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What really intrigues me about it is when/if it will show up for\nrental. I have a few tentative ideas in this space I’d love to\nexplore but I don’t think would justify the cost of owning one.</p>\n\n<p>Looks like Lensrentals rents a vaguely similar, traditional\nBlackmagic camera kit for around $1,000/week ... which would make\nexperimentation much more accessible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/17/blackmagic-ursa-cine-immersive-camera\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9acf07a6f80ae0a639d5dcc6d9fc5cc234faea8d6e85926dff713144511f0e14","category":"Tech"}
