CurveTec is a smart zoning system which expertly wraps and protects crucial muscle groups based on women’s unique curves and physiological structure, helping to enhance mobility and overall performance when cycling.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Jelenew women's cycling clothing\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Jelenew</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>CurveTec works by mapping the technical fabric to align with female body heat-regulation mechanisms, ensuring that areas prone to sweating are well-ventilated while other areas are protected against the elements such as sunlight, wind and cold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the brand’s most game-changing products is the Horizon Short Sleeve Jersey (£201), which boasts an aerodynamic design and is made with moisture-wicking materials, while also being effortlessly flattering. The jersey enables riders to cycle flat out in comfort and style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TurboSpin Quick Release bib shorts (£192) are another noteworthy offering. Suitable for up to eight hours of comfortable riding, the bib shorts have an easy-to-use comfort break feature plus cargo pockets and pro-level chamois.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For colder days, the Jelenew L’avenir Long Sleeve jersey (£301) epitomises the brand’s focus on haute couture design interwoven with functionality. Combining a flattering shaped design with high-performance Italian fabric, the aerodynamic jersey perfectly wraps the body and the contoured panelling creates a muscle-defining effect, all the while keeping the rider warm and comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Created and worn by champions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Heading up the technical side of the brand is Marion Clignet, a French six-time world track champion, world-record holder and two-time Olympic silver medalist, who brings her wealth of expertise to create pioneering cycling clothing for women.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Jelenew women's cycling clothing\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Jelenew</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘During my time as a professional cyclist I experienced every issue we women face when trying to find the best cycling kit, from chafing to erratic temperature regulation and discomfort, to unflattering and unfashionable options. I’ve tried it all,’ explains Clignet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It can be very frustrating, especially as often women’s cycling apparel on the market is just a scaled down version of the men’s with a different print, but that’s where Jelenew comes in. We are a women’s sports brand genuinely committed to addressing female cycling issues and creating stylish kit that lasts.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the brand’s expertise, Jelenew was a perfect choice to create the jerseys for the ride leaders of the CIC Tour Féminin International des Pyrénées. The collaboration has led to the brand releasing an ultra-lightweight race jersey (£279), which is optimised for speed and comfort and is made with Jelenew’s unique CurveTec technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More than just cycling clothing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What sets Jelenew apart from other luxury sportswear brands is that it combines creating high performance cycling clothing with its mission to promote women’s cycling globally and enable women to achieve their dreams.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Jelenew women's cycling clothing\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/jelenew-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Jelenew</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Avery Cavner, a 16-year-old competitive cyclist who lives with type one diabetes, benefits from wearing Jelenew kit as she enjoys the various disciplines in cycling, from road to track and mountain biking.
