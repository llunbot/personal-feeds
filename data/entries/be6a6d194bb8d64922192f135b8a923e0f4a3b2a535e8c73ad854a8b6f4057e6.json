Years ago, a kid stole a Mac laptop out of my car. Years\nlater, I was checking out Find My and it showed a map with the\nhouse where the kid who stole my Mac lived. WTF Apple? How is\nthat okay?!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Responding to arguments that Find My only allows people to track devices <em>that they own</em>, <a href=\"https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1818280387455410311\">Sweeney dug deeper</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A lot of people are saying this here. While technically true, it\nmisses the point: you can’t track the location of a device that’s\nin someone’s possession without tracking that person, and people\nhave a right to privacy. This right applies to second hand device\nbuyers and even to thieves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Thieves deserve privacy too</em> is quite the take.</p>\n\n<p>When you reset a Mac, iPhone, or iPad before selling it, the original owner can no longer track it. Find My poses no problem at all for legitimately transferred pre-owned devices. It only poses a problem for thieves — <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/12/fortnite-video-game-maker-epic-games-pay-more-half-billion-dollars-over-ftc-allegations\">a group Sweeney perhaps has an affinity for</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@bzamayo/post/C-Dz4fMsw6h\">Benjamin Mayo, on Threads</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If Find My didn’t exist, he’d says it’s a racket that Apple\ndoesn’t help users recover their lost devices in order to sell\nmore new hardware.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/30/sweeney-find-my\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"be6a6d194bb8d64922192f135b8a923e0f4a3b2a535e8c73ad854a8b6f4057e6","category":"Tech"}
