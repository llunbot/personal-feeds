A day later, MSI issued a <a href=\"https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Statement-141688\">terse advisory</a> saying that it had “suffered a cyberattack on part of its information systems.” The advisory urged customers to get updates from the MSI website only. It made no mention of leaked keys.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938422#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938422&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e2d0fbe81ad702340789306d8a9fce20539cccfd235dae97d0e8497e5841d18d","category":"Tech"}
