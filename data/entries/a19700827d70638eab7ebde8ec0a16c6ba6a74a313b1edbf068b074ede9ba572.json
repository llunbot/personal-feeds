Then, 2 years ago they machined the EVOs down even further<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hope-evo-155mm-cranks/\" target=\"_blank\"> to just 155mm</a> long. The idea started with shorter cranks for eMTBs to improve clearance riding technical trails, but soon even some DH &amp; Enduro racers <a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/webtop/modules/_repository/1/documents/EVO_155_foot_position.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">were sold</a> on the increase in rider stability, quicker acceleration, improved stiffness, and even lighter weight that came as a by-product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hope’s R&amp;D team then said they had tested down to 140mm. But apparently, they didn’t stop there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the EVO cranks get a 135mm option too!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So why shorter again?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_backside-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_backside-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hope EVO 135mm ultra-short UK-machined alloy MTB cranks, up close\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_backside-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_backside-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_backside-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_backside-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_backside-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Shorter 135mm EVO cranks get all of the same benefits that Hope hyped with the 155mm version, just taken to the next level. Improved stability, quicker spin-up, improved ground clearance, bigger effective gearing drive ratio, lighter weight, stiffer connection between pedal &amp; bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“<em>[M]aybe you are a downhiller for whom the existing 155mm just isn’t short enough. Maybe you want a tougher option for your child’s bike.</em>” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever your reason, a new Hope EVO 135mm crankarm simply means more options to better suit the individual needs or desires of more riders. And of course, you still get spindle lengths to fit all mountain bikes, and the full rainbow of Hope anodized aluminum colors to bring the matchy-matchy bling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_exploded-view-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_exploded-view-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hope EVO 135mm ultra-short UK-machined alloy MTB cranks, exploded view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_exploded-view-jpg.webp 2100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_exploded-view-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_exploded-view-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_exploded-view-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_exploded-view-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_exploded-view-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_exploded-view-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_exploded-view-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>crankarms forged and then CNC-machined from 7150 alloy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>30mm machined 7075 modular axles, available in 4 lengths for all BBs from 68-120mm wide</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_all-length-options-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_all-length-options-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Hope EVO 135mm ultra-short UK-machined alloy MTB cranks, size options\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_all-length-options-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_all-length-options-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_all-length-options-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_all-length-options-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_all-length-options-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_all-length-options-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hope-EVO-135mm_ultra-short-UK-machined-alloy-MTB-cranks_all-length-options-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>135, 155, 165, 170 &amp; 175mm lengths now available</li>\n\n\n\n<li>available in black, silver, blue, red, purple &amp; orange ano</li>\n\n\n\n<li>proprietary splined interface for direct-mount 1x chainrings or spiders</li>\n\n\n\n<li>add a spiderless 1x ring (28-32T) for 9-12sp drivetrains, or 4-arm spiders</li>\n\n\n\n<li>NOTE: shorter arms necessitate smaller rings.
