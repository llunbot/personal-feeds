{"title":"Roblox: Hugely Popular, Yet Unprofitable","link":"https://www.matthewball.co/all/roblox2024","date":1724776351000,"content":"\n<p>Matthew Ball has written an excellent deep-dive into Roblox:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Compared to its most similar competitors — the social virtual\nworld platforms, Minecraft and Fortnite — Roblox has about 5× and\n2.25× as many monthly players. For non-gamers, Roblox has about\ntwo thirds as many monthly users as Spotify and half as many as\nSnap (though it probably has a lower share of daily-to-monthly\nactive users) and is roughly as popular as Instagram circa Q4\n2015, and Facebook in Q3 2009.</p>\n\n<p>Each month, players spend close to six billion hours using Roblox.\nThis time excludes the viewing of Roblox content on Twitch or\nYouTube, the largest video platform on earth and which counts\nnon-live gaming content as its second most popular genre, with\nRoblox one of its five most watched games. Most estimates suggest\nthe average Disney+ account watches no more than 20 hours per\nmonth, which would mean about 3.1 billion hours in total monthly\nwatch time — barely half of Roblox’s total.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So yes, Roblox is unquestionably “working.” Yet Roblox is also\nunprofitable. <em>Very</em> unprofitable. What’s more, Roblox’s losses\ncontinue to swell because its impressive rate of revenue growth\nhas been outpaced by that of its costs. [...] Over the last twelve\nmonths it has averaged $138 in costs for every $100 in revenue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/27/roblox-ball\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f1b46a2b8614fb4847fad930c974f4c1ea372cdb4b477f69adf54da65de6cde1","category":"Tech"}
