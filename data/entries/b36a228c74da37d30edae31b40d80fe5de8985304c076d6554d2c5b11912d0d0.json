But the AirTags need accessories if you want to add them to your keychain or your bag so that’s gonna cost you extra. They’re also $29 and we haven’t seen them lower than $23 outside it was Black Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ugreen FineTrack is just as small, albeit with a square shape, and they come with an integrated hole for your keychain. They feature replaceable batteries that last for about two years, too. They’re also safe to use and sturdy, ready to survive bumps and drops. Much like with AirTags, you can track their location via Find My and offer global positioning. When out of range of your device, they’ll ping off other Apple gadgets. Plus, they’ll remind you if you leave them behind. If you’re in a hurry in the morning and can’t find the keys, you can use the app to have it ring. There’s no way you’ll miss that 80db alarm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From any angle, these Ugreen FineTrack smart trackers are a great alternative to AirTags, especially since you can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D53RXMB1/\">get one for $10 right now</a> that they’re 50 percent off.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b36a228c74da37d30edae31b40d80fe5de8985304c076d6554d2c5b11912d0d0","category":"Apple"}
