{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT review: RDNA 4 fixes a lot of AMD’s problems","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-review-rdna-4-fixes-a-lot-of-amds-problems/","date":1741203070000,"content":"<p>AMD is a company that knows a thing or two about capitalizing on a competitor's weaknesses. The company got through its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/amd-on-ropes-from-the-top-of-the-mountain-to-the-deepest-valleys/\">early-2010s nadir</a> partially because its Ryzen CPUs struck just as Intel's current manufacturing woes began to set in, first with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/03/amd-ryzen-review/\">somewhat-worse CPUs that were great value for the money</a> and later with CPUs that were <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/hands-on-zen-3-testing-with-amds-ryzen-9-5900x-and-5950x/\">better than anything Intel could offer</a>.</p>\n<p>Nvidia's untrammeled dominance of the consumer graphics card market should also be an opportunity for AMD. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards have given buyers very little to get excited about, with an unreachably expensive high-end 5090 refresh and modest-at-best gains from 5080 and 5070-series cards that are <em>also</em> pretty expensive by historical standards, when you can buy them at all. Tech YouTubers—both the people making the videos and the people leaving comments underneath them—have been almost uniformly unkind to the 50 series, hinting at consumer frustrations and pent-up demand for competitive products from other companies.</p>\n<p>Enter AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards. These are aimed right at the middle of the current GPU market at the intersection of high sales volume and decent profit margins. They promise good 1440p and entry-level 4K gaming performance and improved power efficiency compared to previous-generation cards, with fixes for long-time shortcomings (ray-tracing performance, video encoding, and upscaling quality) that should, in theory, make them more tempting for people looking to ditch Nvidia.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-review-rdna-4-fixes-a-lot-of-amds-problems/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-review-rdna-4-fixes-a-lot-of-amds-problems/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"91e7f5bedb44b146950907578f7d458d40fd28c0a82713ffd25a3c49d70a7285","category":"Tech"}
