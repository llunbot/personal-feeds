We can also confirm the ninth-generation iPad has the same 3GB of RAM as the eighth-generation model. These amounts were revealed in strings contained within the Xcode 13 beta.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor comparison, the iPad Pro is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/ipad-pro-16-gb-storage-based-on-capacity/\">available with up to 16GB of RAM</a> depending on storage capacity, while the latest iPad Air <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/05/new-ipad-air-4-4gb-ram/\">has 4GB of RAM</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe same type of Xcode strings accurately revealed the amount of RAM in iPhone 12 models last year and in several previous iPhone generations. Teardowns and regulatory filings should provide further confirmation in the coming days.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new iPad mini and iPad models are available to order now on Apple's website and launch on Friday, September 24. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/15/how-much-ram-in-2021-ipad-mini/\">Redesigned iPad Mini Has Increased 4GB of RAM, iPad 9 Remains at 3GB</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/redesigned-ipad-mini-has-increased-4gb-of-ram-ipad-9-remains-at-3gb.2311077/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=99SlY2X8P_8:U7qVLnkBszY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=99SlY2X8P_8:U7qVLnkBszY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/99SlY2X8P_8\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"181e0ffd147371b08cc7c67b24d248266df256e8e5bddc28efb77aef865cedc5","category":"Apple"}
