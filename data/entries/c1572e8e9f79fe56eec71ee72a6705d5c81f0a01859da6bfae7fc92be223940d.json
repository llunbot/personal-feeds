As it stands, Bruno Armiail (Groupama-FDJ) wears the leader’s pink jersey by 1’08” over Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers) and 1’10” from Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Tao Geoghegan Hart abandons Giro d’Italia with broken hip</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>I’m devastated this is how my giro ended. Thankyou all for your messages and support. I was so excited about the remainder of this race and loving every minute of it. Arrivederci <a href=\"https://twitter.com/giroditalia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@giroditalia</a> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2b55.png\" alt=\"⭕\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/rJ7nBfe77s\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/rJ7nBfe77s</a></p>— Tao Geoghegan Hart (@taogeoghegan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taogeoghegan/status/1658886512618897423?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">May 17, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ineos Grenadiers’ Tao Geoghegan Hart, who began Stage 11 in third place and just five seconds behind <em>maglia rosa</em> Geraint Thomas, saw his challenge for a second Giro d’Italia title end with a broken hip. A slide by Alessandro Covi (UAE Team Emirates) caused a chain-reaction of falls behind, taking down Thomas, Roglič and several Ineos Grenadiers riders on the slippery descent. Geoghegan Hart was the worst affected, remaining conscious but staying down after the fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sight of Jumbo-Visma’s Koen Bouwman checking on Geoghegan Hart was a nice reminder of sportsmanship within the peloton. Bouwman had given his bike to team leader Roglič and he took the time to ask Geoghegan Hart about his condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Geoghegan Hart was transported to hospital by ambulance and underwent successful surgery on his left hip. Covi was able to finish the stage 11 minutes down on winner and teammate Pascal Ackermann, but withdrew before the start of Stage 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Geoghegan Hart’s teammate Geraint Thomas said ‘It’s certainly never straightforward in the Giro but the weather this time is the worst I’ve known. The wet roads are just adding to the stress and chaos.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Flooding hits Italy</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Primoz-roglic-giro-2023-luca-bettini-via-getty-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Primoz-roglic-giro-2023-luca-bettini-via-getty-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Primoz-roglic-giro-2023-luca-bettini-via-getty-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Primoz-roglic-giro-2023-luca-bettini-via-getty-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Primoz-roglic-giro-2023-luca-bettini-via-getty-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Primoz-roglic-giro-2023-luca-bettini-via-getty-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Primoz-roglic-giro-2023-luca-bettini-via-getty-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Primoz-roglic-giro-2023-luca-bettini-via-getty-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Primoz-roglic-giro-2023-luca-bettini-via-getty-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Primoz-roglic-giro-2023-luca-bettini-via-getty-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Primoz-roglic-giro-2023-luca-bettini-via-getty-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Primož Roglič before Stage 13 of the Giro d’Italia</figcaption><figcaption>Luca Bettini/Getty</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, northern Italy experienced its worst flooding in 100 years after six months’ worth of rain fell in 36 hours. 14 lives were lost and over 36,000 people are now homeless, with the Emilia-Romagna region hit the worst. The Giro d’Italia is supporting “Un aiuto subito”, a campaign promoted by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera for immediate help. You can find out more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/giroditalia/status/1660235043963379715\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Giro d’Italia peloton passed through the Emilia-Romagna region during Stage 9’s individual time-trial which finished in Cesena before the first rest day, picking up again in Scandiano for Stage 10 on Tuesday 16th May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On that stage, retired rider Adam Hansen, who is now President of the rider union CPA, confirmed that shortening the stage was under discussion because of 3°C weather and rain at the top of the Passo delle Radici. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The race was not neutralised and Magnus Cort (EF Education-EasyPost), Derek Gee (Israel Premier-Tech) and Alessandro De Marchi would sprint it out at the finish in Viareggio. With this stage win at the Giro, Cort became the latest member of the Grand Tour Grand Slam club.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Snow shortens Cima Coppi and stage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 13 of the Giro d’Italia was scheduled to be a 199km ride from Borgofranco d’Ivrea to Crans-Montana. This did not come to pass. In the days previous, the safety of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/switzerland-croix-de-coeur-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Croix de Coeur</a> descent was in question because of snowfall on the second climb. Also affected was the Cima Coppi of the Gran San Bernardo, the first climb, with its highest point of 2,469m cut to 1,875m during the week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The route of Stage 13 was discussed the night before in a group chat with the CPA, where all teams held a vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>I will speak out and defend the riders for the dry roads. First, we were told stage 10 we could not negotiate just before the start when the weather is most accurate. 20 guys went home in a 24-hour period. We were told we can not negotiate days in advance because the weather can…</p>— Adam Hansen (@HansenAdam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HansenAdam/status/1659553568435712005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">May 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an interesting compromise on paper, given that the climb riders didn’t want to tackle was not only still included but came immediately after the flag drop. Thomas believed it was a good decision but others, such as Bahrain Victorious’ Jack Haig, did not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haig said ‘I don’t fully agree, because one of the main reasons that we didn’t want to do the middle climb was because the road surface on the downhill was potentially dangerous. Now we’re starting at the bottom of the climb… then doing the downhill, with guys racing to bridge back to the groups they’ve been dropped from… so I don’t really understand.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the weather had improved in Switzerland and a compromise had been reached. After riders completed the neutralised zone in pouring rain, they boarded team buses to head to Le Châble, at the start of the Croix de Coeur for 74.6km of racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it’s worth, I appreciate the honesty and communication from Hansen. It could have been less confusing, but I can’t imagine it’s easy to juggle the CPA and organisers <em>while</em> the stage is meant to be happening. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. An attacking Thibaut Pinot</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-thibaut-pinot-giro-stage-13-2023-smaller-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist comes across finish line of race exhausted\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-thibaut-pinot-giro-stage-13-2023-smaller-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-thibaut-pinot-giro-stage-13-2023-smaller-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-thibaut-pinot-giro-stage-13-2023-smaller-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-thibaut-pinot-giro-stage-13-2023-smaller-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-thibaut-pinot-giro-stage-13-2023-smaller-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-thibaut-pinot-giro-stage-13-2023-smaller-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-thibaut-pinot-giro-stage-13-2023-smaller-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-thibaut-pinot-giro-stage-13-2023-smaller-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-thibaut-pinot-giro-stage-13-2023-smaller-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-thibaut-pinot-giro-stage-13-2023-smaller-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Stuart Franklin/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If that wasn’t enough drama for Stage 13 already, Thibaut Pinot was <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/thibaut-pinot-giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">riding like a man unchained</a>. Attack after attack in search of a Giro d’Italia stage win, in what is his final appearance at the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jefferson Cepeda (EF Education-EasyPost) was well within his rights not to burn himself out on the front for Pinot and drag him to the line, when Pinot was clearly willing to put the effort in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was frustrating for Pinot, but that’s cycling. As Israel Premier-Tech DS Sam Bewley said to Sebastian Berwick on Stage 12; ‘Don’t be afraid to be an arsehole for seven kilometres of your life.’ Movistar rider and fellow breakaway partner Einer Rubio would win the stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Afterwards, Pinot said; ‘Maybe he had instructions. His excuse was the general classification for (Hugh) Carthy, I can’t understand it. If I don’t ride, we’re treading water. I hope at least that they will thank me, otherwise we would have not raced for victory.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it’s good to see Pinot has recovered from the illness he suffered in the first week and he’ll no doubt be on the hunt in the final six stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Ben Healy has been the standout so far</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-14897699351-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-14897699351-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-14897699351-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-14897699351-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-14897699351-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-14897699351-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-14897699351-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-14897699351-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-14897699351-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/GettyImages-14897699351.jpg 1417w\" /><figcaption>Ben Healy wins Stage 8 of the Giro d’Italia</figcaption><figcaption>Stuart Franklin/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I called the EF Education-EasyPost rider a Duracell bunny and I meant it. He’ll be using this rest day to recharge his batteries no doubt. After a spectacular <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/classics\" target=\"_blank\">Classics</a> campaign, Healy took to the start line of the Giro d’Italia with breakaways in mind. He won through a solo effort on Stage 8 into Fossombone and has been isolating himself from the peloton wherever possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Healy made the break on Stage 15 alongside Rubio and the pair launched an entertaining battle for KOM points, shoulders and elbows out while fans moved out of their way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Healy won the maximum 40 points and the duo repeated their sprint on the second climb before fist bumping one another. Towards the end of the day, Healy was out in front alone. He was joined by Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates) and Marco Frigo (Israel Premier-Tech) for a sprint finish with McNulty winning his maiden Grand Tour stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Into the third and final week of the Giro d’Italia</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we’re talking. The peloton immediately launches into the Alps, where a Category 1 summit on the Monte Bondone awaits on Stage 16. From there, it’s one of the last flat days before the gradient kicks up and up and up again on Stage 18, navigating eight hairpins on an average 7% gradient towards the Zoldo Alto.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final racing mountain day on Stage 19 has Dolomites aplenty, with a generous ramp up towards the first Category 2 climb of the Passo Campolongo, scaling three more climbs and finishing on the Category 1 Tre Cime di Lavaredo. Stage 20 is a ferocious 18.6km time-trial to Monte Lussari, with a maximum gradient of 22%. Ouch. At least there’s the ceremonial trip around Rome for the final stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Stage 1 winner: Remco Evenepoel (Soudal Quick-Step)</li><li>Stage 2 winner: Jonathan Milan (Bahrain Victorious)</li><li>Stage 3 winner: Michael Matthews (Jayco-AlUla)</li><li>Stage 4 winner: Aurélien Paret-Peintre (AG2R Citroën Team)</li><li>Stage 5 winner: Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck)</li><li>Stage 6 winner: Mads Pedesen (Trek-Segafredo)</li><li>Stage 7 winner: Davide Bais (EOLO-Kometa)</li><li>Stage 8 winner: Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost)</li><li>Stage 9 winner: Remco Evenepoel (Soudal Quick-Step)</li><li>Stage 10 winner: Maagnus Cort (EF Eduction-EasyPost)</li><li>Stage 11 winner: Pascal Ackermann (UAE Team Emirates)</li><li>Stage 12 winner: Nico Denz (BORA-Hansgohe)</li><li>Stage 13 winner: Einer Rubio (Movistar)</li><li>Stage 14 winner: Nico Denz (BORA-Hansgohe)</li><li>Stage 15 winner: Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Maglia rosa: Bruno Armirail (Groupama-FDJ)</li><li>Maglia ciclamino: Jonathan Milan (Bahrain Victorious)</li><li>Maglia azzurra: Davide Bais (EOLO-Kometa)</li><li>Maglia bianca: João Almeida (UAE Team Emirates)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia hub page</a> for more.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2023-week-2\">Giro d’Italia Rest Day Recap: Tao Geoghegan Hart breaks hip, flooding hits Italy, weather shortens stage and Ben Healy is a phenomenon</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"c1572e8e9f79fe56eec71ee72a6705d5c81f0a01859da6bfae7fc92be223940d","category":"Cycling"}
