He said the state cannot give a bottle to everyone when 600\nto 1,000 people are crossing every day.</p>\n\n<p>“If they see a child or an adult that looks like they’re suffering\nfrom some kind of heat exhaustion, they’ll give them water,”\nOlivarez said. “But we can’t just keep handing out water because\nwhat’s going to happen is, you’re going to continue to encourage\nthem to come.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is how you know Texas governor Greg Abbott <a href=\"https://elefanti.co/@adam/110786985323665974\">is an idiot</a> — the cruelty in this passage is off the charts. We’re talking about <em>water</em> here, in severe heat.

Just incredible.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/27/handing-out-water\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ff97d35be7c529db1773342bfcbecf21a3279a6618fc297bcfe839ad77ac9c6a","category":"Tech"}
