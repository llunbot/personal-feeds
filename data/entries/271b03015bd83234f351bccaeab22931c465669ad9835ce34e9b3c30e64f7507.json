TSMC will also receive $5 billion in loans and be eligible to claim an investment tax credit of up to 25% of capital expenditures. The move is part of a larger initiative under the CHIPS and Science Act, which aims to rejuvenate the United States' semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTSMC has already committed to an escalated investment of $25 billion, elevating its total investment to $65 billion. This is the largest foreign direct investment in a completely new project in U.S. history.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe chipmaker also announced plans to construct a third fabrication plant in Arizona by 2030. The first TSMC plant in Arizona will start producing 4nm chips next year. The second plant, which was originally designed to make <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a> chips, will also make 2nm ones by 2028. The third plant will produce 2nm chips with capacity to make even more advanced semiconductors in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's most advanced chips are currently made in Taiwan using TSMC's ‌3nm‌ process, so the ability to make these chips and even more powerful ones in the future in the United States could represent a significant future shift in the company's supply chain.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/\">TSMC</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/08/tsmc-to-step-up-u-s-production/\">Apple Chipmaker TSMC to Receive $6.6 Billion Grant to Step Up Production in the U.S.</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-chipmaker-tsmc-to-receive-6-6-billion-grant-to-step-up-production-in-the-u-s.2423753/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"271b03015bd83234f351bccaeab22931c465669ad9835ce34e9b3c30e64f7507","category":"Apple"}
