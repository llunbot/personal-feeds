Since <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/10/google-liberates-android-source-code-so-start-developing/\">the beginning</a>, large swaths of the software have been developed in public-facing channels, but that will no longer be the case. This does not mean Android is shedding its open source roots, but the process won't be as transparent.</p>\n<p>Google <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/\">has confirmed</a> to Android Authority that all Android development work going forward will take place in Google's internal branch. This is a shift from the way Google has worked on Android in the past, which featured frequent updates to the public AOSP branch. Anyone can access AOSP, but the internal branches are only available to Google and companies with a Google Mobile Services (GMS) license, like Samsung, Motorola, and others.</p>\n<p>According to the company, it is making this change to simplify things, building on a recent change to trunk-based development. As Google works on both public and private branches of Android, the two fall out of sync with respect to features and API support. This forces Google to tediously merge the branches for every release. By focusing on the internal branch, Google claims it can streamline releases and make life easier for everyone.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-makes-android-development-private-will-continue-open-source-releases/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-makes-android-development-private-will-continue-open-source-releases/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"046362a23ec3c358d803223ab23c396ce530128439ddf6f80dfc65c53e706a06","category":"Tech"}
