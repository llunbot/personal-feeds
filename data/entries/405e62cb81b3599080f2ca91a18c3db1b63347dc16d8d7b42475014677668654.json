{"title":"The Verge: ‘Apple’s New FineWoven iPhone Cases Are Very Bad’","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882255/apple-iphone-15-finewoven-case-wallet-bad","date":1695334296000,"content":"\n<p>Allison Johnson, The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If I’m putting one of these cases on my phone, I’m inevitably \ngoing to scratch it on accident with a jagged fingernail edge, or \nit’s going to come into contact with my car keys. And when you \nscratch FineWoven, the results are seemingly permanent. When we \nfirst inspected the cases after picking them up at Apple Park, \nVerge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel picked one up and ran his \nfingernails across it five times — and that was all it took to \nleave a trail of indelible scuffs on the fabric. The scratches are \nstill there a week later, no matter how many times I’ve tried \n“buffing” it out by rubbing my finger over it. </p>\n\n<p>I’m trying to imagine what this case would be like after a year of \nbeing subjected to the dust and lint at the bottom of my purse or \nthe stray scratches from nails and keys. God help me if my toddler \never managed to put his grubby hands on it, which he absolutely \nwould. I just don’t see any way that this material ages \ngracefully. The leather cases had their problems, but when leather \ngets old, it at least looks nice — a scuffed, dusty fabric case \nwill not. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m curious what real-world usage will look like, but that fingernail test doesn’t seem fair when comparing FineWoven to leather. One fingernail scratched across one of Apple’s leather cases or wallets will leave a permanent mark too. Perhaps it’s the case that such wear looks good on leather but bad on FineWoven.</p>\n\n<p>Judging from my inbox, third-party leather case makers are <em>very</em> excited about Apple’s decision no longer to use it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Also worth noting is that Apple’s new <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTJD3AM/A/45mm-evergreen-magnetic-link-m-l\">FineWoven Magnetic Link Apple Watch bands</a> are not yet available — you can’t even place a pre-order for a new watch that comes paired with one, nor a standalone watch strap. The <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUHC3AM/A/41mm-lavender-blue-modern-buckle-medium\">FineWoven Modern Buckle straps</a> are available, but not the Magnetic Link.
