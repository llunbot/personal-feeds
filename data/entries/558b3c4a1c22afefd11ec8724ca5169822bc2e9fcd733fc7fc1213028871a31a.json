If you’re in the market for some new shred-ready rubber, be sure to check this one out.</p>\n<p>Thursday then saw a veritable potpourri of new products from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rapha-expands-winter-wear-across-pro-team-city-and-explore-ranges/\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-brompton-p-line/\" target=\"_blank\">Brompton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/trek-speed-concept/\" target=\"_blank\">Trek</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/new-zwift-map-neokyo/\" target=\"_blank\">Zwift</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/giant-anthem-2022/\" target=\"_blank\">Giant</a> – phew!</p>\n<p>However, most importantly of all, we welcomed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/jackevans\">Jack Evans</a> as BikeRadar’s newest digital writer.

For punters who enjoy riding in such conditions, it could also be a valuable (albeit expensive) addition to your riding wardrobe.</p>\n<p>Of course, a classic cycling cap or a dorky elasticated helmet cover would accomplish exactly the same thing.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re like me and loathe wearing a hat under a helmet (sacrilege, I know), or are too much of a fashion victim to use one of those covers, then this might be a good shout.</p>\n<p>The helmet is available in the pictured high-visibility AVIP Orange or a handsome shade of green.</p>\n<ul><li>£230 / $260 / €260 / AU$ N/A</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2><em>Further Adventures in Rough Stuff</em></h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This book is a must-buy.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Rough-Stuff Fellowship is the world’s oldest off-road cycling club.

The rear and side panels are made from a stretchy material to improve fit.
