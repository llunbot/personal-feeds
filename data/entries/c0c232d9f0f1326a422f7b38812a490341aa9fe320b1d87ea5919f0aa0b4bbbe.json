Although she admits that she remains one of the stronger riders in the peloton, she stated that she doesn’t want to continue spending so much time competing in Europe.</span></p>\n<p><span>Winder spoke about her decision in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_Vey4cOmMs&amp;ab\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube video</a>. “I feel like I've been on the verge of making this decision for a few years and just really feel at peace with it now in my heart. I feel really lucky to be on Trek-Segafredo and I feel like I've reached so many of my dreams already but my heart misses home while I'm on the road so much of the year because as an American, or somebody that doesn't live in Europe, you have to sacrifice quite a lot of your life when you're over in Europe racing.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Winder added, \"It's become really clear for me that the universe back at home is the one that's pulling me stronger.\"</span></p>\n<h4><b>Tony Martin</b></h4>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1341303610-min_dca04e20-4037-4a59-81f7-f9fce3b6e566_1024x1024.jpg?v=1634557560\" /></b></p>\n<p><span><em>Tony Martin finished sixth in his final individual time trial at the World Championships.

Alongside Fabian Cancellara, Tony Martin is the only other cyclist to have won the men’s time trial at the World Championships four times. The German won the rainbow jersey in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2016. His time-trialling skills helped him to three of his five Tour de France stage victories, whilst he showed his versatility to win two stages with attacks in 2014 and 2015.</span></p>\n<p><span>Martin cited safety concerns as a major reason for his retirement, “</span><span>The bad crashes this year have caused me to question whether I am ready to continue to face the risks that our sport involves. I have decided that I do not want to, especially since race safety has not improved despite the many discussions about courses and barriers. Hopefully the cycling world will listen to the plans presented by my team and other teams.”</span></p>\n<h4><b>Dan Martin</b></h4>\n<p><span>With stage victory on Sega di Ala at the Giro d’Italia, Dan Martin joined an elite club — a stage winner at all three Grand Tours. Martin already had two stage wins at both the Tour de France and Vuelta a <span>España</span>. The Irishman retires as a double monument winner after collecting </span><span>victories at <span>Liège–Bastogne–Liège</span> in 2013 and Il Lombardia in 2014.</span></p>\n<p><span>Announcing his retirement, Martin said, “I feel that the time is right to move on as I want to achieve so many other things in life. In some ways, deciding to stop has been challenging and complex; it’s perhaps one of the biggest and most important decisions I’ve made; and in other ways, it’s been easy.”</span></p>\n<h4><b>Nico Roche</b></h4>\n<p><span>Martin will retire alongside his cousin, Nico Roche. The Irishman won two stages of the Vuelta a <span>España throughout his career</span>, and finished fifth and sixth in the GC in 2013 and 2010 respectively.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>See Nico Roche at </i></b><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/rouleur-live\"><b><i>Rouleur Live</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p>\n<p><span>“I always thought I would keep racing for as long as possible\", said Roche in his retirement announcement. \"T</span><span>hese riders often said that one morning you will wake up and just know it is time to retire. You will be ready to try something else, have new challenges and new goals. I never believed them until that day arrived for me in August.
