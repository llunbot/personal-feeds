It needs to depart the orbiting research complex, with or without its two-person crew, before the launch of SpaceX's next Dragon crew mission to the station, scheduled for September 24.</p>\n<p>\"We can juggle things and make things work if we need to extend, but it’s getting a lot harder,\" said Ken Bowersox, associate administrator of NASA's spaceflight operations directorate. \"With the consumables we’re using, with the need for the use of the ports for cargo missions, those types of things, we’re reaching a point where that last week in August, we really should be making a call, if not sooner.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043356#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043356&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e6810d52ee761bc3c0129ff56d7b2092bfc3896dda09f6dc565d337cc1728f0f","category":"Tech"}
