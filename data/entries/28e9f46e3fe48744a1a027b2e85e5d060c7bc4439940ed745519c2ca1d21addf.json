There are a few key points to setting up a home gym that will engage you and fit your space. Mirror- and screen-based fitness devices aim to roll these solutions into one device that delivers diverse, engaging training.</p>\n<p>These systems can make exercising much more fun and convenient while providing a solid foundation for every level of exerciser to build on with different hardware packages and progressive content. The devices can range from around $200 all the way up to $6,000 or more, and that’s without mandatory subscription fees for content.</p>\n<p>The device manufacturers swear by the engagement, convenience, and resultant efficacy of such machines, and there’s a case to be made for how these initial expenditures can save you money compared to a traditional gym-based experience.
