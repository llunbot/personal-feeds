And by the looks of it, the new iPhone SE will be a similar size to the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/negativeonehero/status/1776839223431332265&amp;xcust=1-1-2303033-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on X by @negstiveonehero (who has no track record as a leaker so we can’t vouch for their credibility), the iPhone SE 4 will be bigger than the current iPhone SE 3. The front will be similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/544579/iphone-13-review.html\">iPhone 13</a>, and the back will have a one-lens camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>iPhone SE 4 rumored specifications:<br />– Size and weight: 148.5 x 71.2 x 7.8mm, 166g<br />– Appearance: 7000 series aluminium alloy, right-angled frame, front and rear glass (no Ceramic Shield). Front looks like iPhone 13, with Face ID support; back looks like Xr, with one camera.</p>— Nguyen Phi Hung (@negativeonehero) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/negativeonehero/status/1776839223431332265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2303033-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 7, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the posted dimensions are correct, this would mean that the iPhone SE 4 would be a little taller than the iPhone 15 (147.6 mm) and the iPhone 15 Pro (146.6 mm), but not by much–you might not even notice the difference. The current iPhone SE is 138.4 mm, so the rumored iPhone SE 4 could be 7 percent taller than its predecessor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The change in height follows the claim that Apple will put a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2289762/iphone-se-4-leak-display-specs-price.html\">6.1-inch screen in the iPhone SE 4</a>. That rumor stated that this new phone will have an A16 chip, LPDDR5 RAM, a 3,279 mAh battery, and USB-C. The 48MP single-lens camera could have similar specifications to the main camera of the iPhone 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumor has it that the iPhone SE 4 will be priced at $499 and could be announced in the first quarter of 2025.
