LG is already constructing a small production line to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/13/lg-building-line-for-microled-apple-watch/\">supply Apple with microLED displays</a> destined for an Apple Watch model. Opening in the second half of 2024, the facility will reportedly supply microLED backplanes and assemble Apple's displays.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInformation shared in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1651626420593106944\">April</a> by display analyst Ross Young suggested that an ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌ with microLED display would launch in the second half of 2025 at the earliest, rather than late 2024 as was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/apple-custom-displays-microled-apple-watch/\">originally rumored</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, a July report by Trendforce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/04/apple-watch-ultra-microled-delayed-early-2026/\">claims</a> it has been postponed for a second time and is unlikely to emerge before the first quarter of 2026, due to problems relating to high manufacturing costs which need to be solved before Apple can proceed to mass production.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current ‌‌Apple Watch Ultra‌‌ uses standard OLED technology, whereas MicroLED offers many of the benefits of OLED along with some improvements. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nCompared to LED displays, microLED is much more energy efficient and it would likely notably increase battery life on the ‌‌Apple Watch Ultra‌‌ and other devices that adopt the technology in the future. Unlike OLED, there's much less risk of screen burn-in, and microLEDs have a longer potential lifetime.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMicroLED displays also provide contrast improvements and faster response times because of the pixel-level individual lights, plus the color is better and brighter. In a nutshell, it's a next-generation technology superior to OLED and miniLED.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌‌Apple Watch Ultra‌‌ is expected to be the first Apple device to adopt a microLED display, due to the small screen and pixel density of smartwatches. Apple is said to be planning to adopt the technology in smartphones, AR devices, and other devices in the future.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/\">microLED Apple Watch</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/10/lg-producing-microled-displays-apple-watch/\">Apple Supplier LG Invests in MicroLED Patents for Apple Watch Ultra Displays</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-supplier-lg-invests-in-microled-patents-for-apple-watch-ultra-displays.2398251/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"57c33fad0006cbc3b608ff4bc959f7913bd00a97651301f8ec8f3aff33c9a0a9","category":"Apple"}
