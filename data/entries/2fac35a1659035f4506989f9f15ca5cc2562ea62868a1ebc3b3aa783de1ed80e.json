The new Monumental Loop logo departs from the previous logo’s unsanctioned adoption of the sacred Zia Pueblo sun symbol and pinged local artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nightbird/\" target=\"_blank\">Nightbird</a> to reimagine the branding into something more appropriate.</p>\n<p><em>Cōllette Marie is a celebrated Xicana visionary, interdisciplinary artist, and designer from Las Cruces. Her work reflects her deep connection to the Chihuahuan Desert and her dedication to elevating Indigenous and native artistry. </em></p>\n<p>For the first week of this release, we’re donating 100% of the profits to Monumental Loop.
