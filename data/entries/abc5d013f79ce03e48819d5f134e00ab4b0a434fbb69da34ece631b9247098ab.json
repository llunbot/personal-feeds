{"title":"iOS 17: Everything New With Siri and Spotlight","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-siri-spotlight/","date":1691791740000,"content":"In <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, Apple has added a handful of new improvements to on-device personal assistant <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> and the Spotlight search feature. There aren't any major changes, but Spotlight search has improved, and for ‌Siri‌, it's easier than ever to use.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/iOS-17-Siri-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nThis guide highlights all of the ‌Siri‌ and Spotlight features and changes in ‌iOS 17‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>No More Hey Siri</h2>\r<br />\nIn ‌iOS 17‌, you can just say \"‌Siri‌\" to activate ‌Siri‌, dropping the \"Hey\" that's been used as a wake word for years. ‌Siri‌ will activate when you say the ‌Siri‌ word, so you can speak more naturally.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Hey-Siri-vs-Siri.jpeg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"894\" />\r<br />\n\"‌Siri‌, can you tell me what time it is?\" is a phrase that ‌Siri‌ recognizes, for example.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Back-to-Back Requests</h2>\r<br />\n‌Siri‌ is able to recognize and respond to multiple back-to-back requests without needing to be reactivated.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can, for example, ask ‌Siri‌ to tell you the time, and then follow that up with a request to text your friend that you're going to be late all in the same ‌Siri‌ request.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Web Articles</h2>\r<br />\nIn Safari, there's a new ‌Siri‌ feature that allows the personal assistant to read a web article to you. As long as a site has Reader View available, you can say \"‌Siri‌, read this to me\" to have ‌Siri‌ read the content on the page.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/siri-read-article.jpg\" alt=\"siri\" width=\"2860\" height=\"2700\" />\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n <li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-siri-to-read-web-articles-to-you/\">How to Get Siri to Read Web Articles to You</a></li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nThere are playback tools, so you can fast forward, pause, resume, and rewind from the Lock Screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Siri Messaging</h2>\r<br />\nWhen you ask ‌Siri‌ to send a message, you can now tap to select which app you want to send it from. This allows you to send messages not just from Apple's built-in Messages app, but also third-party apps like Telegram and WhatsApp.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/siri-messaging-ios-17.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe feature is compatible with any third-party app that has \"Use with Ask ‌Siri‌\" enabled in the Settings app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Siri and StandBy</h2>\r<br />\n‌Siri‌ can be activated in StandBy mode, the new option for turning a charging <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> into a home hub. When you ask ‌Siri‌ a question, there's a new full-screen UI that will show the results in landscape mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/standby-siri.jpg\" alt width=\"2700\" height=\"1400\" />\r<br />\nIf you ask about the weather, for example, you'll see the current temperature and icons that denote the weather conditions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Siri UK Voices</h2>\r<br />\nThere are two new \"British\" ‌Siri‌ voices available in ‌iOS 17‌, making a total of four.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Siri in India</h2>\r<br />\n‌iOS 17‌ supports bilingual ‌Siri‌ queries that mix English with Hindi, Telegu, Punjabi, Kannada, or Marathi.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Spotlight Search</h2>\r<br />\nSearch results have been improved with new colors and app icons to make it easier to see what's what. If you search for cats, for example, and one of the results is an option to tap into Safari for a web search, you'll see a Safari icon instead of the prior magnifying glass icon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/ios-17-spotlight-search.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>App Shortcuts</h2>\r<br />\nWhen searching for an app, Spotlight now offers App Shortcuts in the top hits section. If you search for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> and often go to the Favorites album, Spotlight will show you a link to get directly to the Favorites album from the search interface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/photos-app-shortcuts.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Read More</h2>\r<br />\nAdditional details on the new features in the ‌iOS 17‌ update can be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">found in our iOS 17 roundup</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-siri-spotlight/\">iOS 17: Everything New With Siri and Spotlight</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-everything-new-with-siri-and-spotlight.2398409/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"abc5d013f79ce03e48819d5f134e00ab4b0a434fbb69da34ece631b9247098ab","category":"Apple"}
