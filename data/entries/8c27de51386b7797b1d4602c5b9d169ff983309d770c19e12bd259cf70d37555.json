The cold <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/classics\" target=\"_blank\">Spring Classics</a> and their bone-jittering cobblestones. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d‚ÄôItalia</a> exploding into life with exploits from Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) and Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech), then last-day shenanigans from Ineos Grenadiers‚Äô Geraint Thomas as he led out Astana Qazaqstan‚Äôs Mark Cavendish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Jumbo-Visma</a> became the first team in history to achieve a Grand Tour sweep thanks to Primo≈æ Rogliƒç, Jonas Vingegaard and Sepp Kuss. Ineos Grenadiers‚Äô Josh Tarling has particularly impressed this year, the 19-year-old British ITT Champion shining with a bronze medal in the Elite Men‚Äôs World ITT Championship<strong>. </strong>His first win arrived on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-vuelta-espana-1\" target=\"_blank\">Stage 2 of the Renewi Tour</a>, where he became the joint youngest WorldTour stage winner (alongside Remco Evenepoel, no less), as he was later crowned the European ITT Champion and closed his year with victory at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vittoria-bussi-uci-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">Chrono des Nations</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end of a cycling season inevitably marks retirements too, with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/thibaut-pinot\" target=\"_blank\">Thibaut Pinot</a> (Groupama-FDJ), Greg van Avermaet (AG2R-Citro√´n) and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/peter-sagan\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Sagan</a> (Team TotalEnergies) all hanging up their cycling cleats. Or in the case of Sagan, just his road-specific ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year was also not without its tragedy. The loss of Bahrain Victorious‚Äô Gino M√§der is so painful, and no doubt still felt by his family, friends and cycling fans worldwide. As you‚Äôll see in this article, his teammates are continuing to honour him, with post-stage tributes from Matej Mohoriƒç and fundraising from Pello Bilbao.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are my choices for the ten most memorable moments from the 2023 men‚Äôs pro season.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-retirements\">End of an era: All the road cycling greats retiring this year</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/mark-cavendish-retirement-delay\">Mark Cavendish delays retirement to race for one more year in 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sepp-kuss-vuelta-a-espana\">Nice guys finish first: The Sepp Kuss effect</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>1.

A solo attack from 50km out, an audacious group breakaway that outfoxes the bunch in the final kilometres, a tyre-width sprint victory. Some riders are forced to wait minutes for confirmation, suspended in a limbo of uncertainty, such is the closeness of their competitors at the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one side of the scale is an eventually crowned victor, who explodes into the wide range of emotions they had been holding back ‚Äì screaming, celebrating, crying ‚Äì while on the other side sits someone who was so close, yet so far. It‚Äôs not often a cyclist uses their time to dissect this equation in their post-stage interview. Enter Bahrain-Victorious‚Äôs Matej Mohoriƒç after winning Stage 19 of the 2023 Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>\"Not just for myself, but for ùôÇùôûùô£ùô§, and the team.\"<br /><br />Incredible interview from Stage 19 winner Matej Mohoric, on finding a way to keep going and get across the line <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2764.png\" alt=\"‚ù§\" /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/matmohoric?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@matmohoric</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BHRVictorious?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@BHRVictorious</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TdF2023?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#TdF2023</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rEYjN6k2kq\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/rEYjN6k2kq</a></p>‚Äî Eurosport (@eurosport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eurosport/status/1682417319358636033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">July 21, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄòSometimes you feel like you don‚Äôt belong here,‚Äô he said in the emotional scene. ‚ÄòEveryone is so incredibly strong that you struggle to hold the wheel sometimes. You know the guy who is pulling is suffering just as much as you. Kasper [Asgreen, Soudal-QuickStep] went and he‚Äôs so incredibly strong. He went on the attack yesterday and won the stage. To have the win and the determination to do it all over again‚Ä¶ you just feel like you don‚Äôt belong here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄòI followed him. I knew everything had to be perfect. I tried my best, not just for myself but also for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-tour-de-suisse\" target=\"_blank\">Gino [M√§der]</a> and the team. Then at the end you almost feel like you betray them because you beat them to the line. The way professional sport is, everyone wants to win and obviously if I want to win, I need to take the wheel of Kasper and try to beat him on the line. At one point I felt sorry for Ben [O‚ÄôConnor, AG2R Citro√´n Team] because I knew he had no chance in the sprint. but he still pushed to stay away because he also wants to contest the win even though he knows he‚Äôs likely to lose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄòI always know I can win a Tour de France stage because I have already won two. I‚Äôm strong enough but so are the other 150 guys. I‚Äôm not the only one who can win a Tour de France stage and every single rider at this moment would deserve a win. I saw the faces of those in the gruppetto the other day on Col de la Loze and you know what everyone is going through. I know how much a win can change your life and I wish everyone could win a Tour de France stage but it‚Äôs just not possible and that‚Äôs cruel, no?‚Äô</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To articulate such humanity in the heat of sports is an admirable quality indeed, and to express his conflicting emotions and empathy for his rivals contributed to one of the best, if not the best, interviews from a professional cyclist that I have ever seen. It‚Äôs something I will continue to think about for many years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Geraint Thomas leads out Mark Cavendish to ‚Äòhelp a brother out‚Äô at the Giro d‚ÄôItalia</h2>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stage 21, Giro d‚ÄôItalia, 28th May 2023</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The role of a leadout man is simple (on paper). With their designated sprinter on their wheel, they give it their all to drop off their teammate who ‚Äì should things go to plan ‚Äì sprints to the victory. But Stage 21 of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia was different. Ineos Grenadiers‚Äô Geraint Thomas proved you don‚Äôt have to be racing on the same squad to provide a successful leadout, and that a friendship extending across rival teams will do just fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the chaos that preceded the sprint finish, Thomas spoke to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mark-cavendish\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Cavendish</a> (Astana Qazaqstan) just prior to the 2km-to-go point. He then hit the front to set a storming pace as Cavendish‚Äôs teammate Luis Le√≥n S√°nchez latched onto his wheel, with Cavendish following. Thomas peeled away at the 1km mark. After that, no one could keep up with Cavendish‚Äôs pace in the final metres, and the Manx Missile crossed the line in what was then his final Giro d‚ÄôItalia. (He has since signed a one-year extension.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the race, Thomas said to Eurosport, ‚ÄòI saw he only had Luis Le√≥n S√°nchez with him and I thought, help a brother out.‚Äô</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

At the Tour de France, Bilbao donated ‚Ç¨1 for every rider he finished ahead of on each stage towards replanting on deforested land. Bilbao said he would double the donation if he achieved a stage win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just one day later, this would be a reality. Bilbao was part of the successful breakaway on Stage 10 towards Issoire. It was a tense final kilometre, with Bilbao and Georg Zimmermann (Intermarch√©-Circus-Wanty) rejoined by their breakaway companions. Bilbao kicked away in the last 200m and stayed ahead to raise his arms in victory for his first Tour de France stage win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄòI crossed the line and I just put out all the energy inside of me and remembered the reason for this victory, a special one ‚Äì for Gino,‚Äô Bilbao said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The teammates were close friends; M√§der had adopted a stray dog in Bilbao and named him Pello.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.

Hundreds of his fans lined the roadside to Le Markstein Fellering, specifically over Le Petit Ballon and gathering on Virage Pinot ‚Äì the bend heralded as a place of worship on Google Maps, such is the almost religious dedication of those drawn to Pinot‚Äôs riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinot had jumped from the chasing group and into the breakaway. It was here that he distanced Ark√©a-Samsic‚Äôs Warren Barguil and Ineos Grenadiers‚Äô Tom Pidcock to cut a lone figure in the distance. Virage Pinot beckoned. The stars had aligned. Pinot was here. Surrounded by his family, friends and fan club.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He wouldn‚Äôt win the stage, but the Frenchman crossed the line 33 seconds down on UAE Team Emirates‚Äô Tadej Pogaƒçar.

It‚Äôs an informal classification throughout the season hosted by yours truly. To top the Vibes Classification in a Grand Tour requires a combination of combativity and chutzpah. Timings on general classification are irrelevant ‚Äì although Jumbo-Visma‚Äôs Sepp Kuss happened to win the general classification <em>and</em> my Vibes Classification at the Vuelta. You just need to possess a can-do spirit, an attacking ability and to err on the side of do rather than do not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) and Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) were the entertainers of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia with a combined five stage combativity awards. Springboarding off a prosperous Classics campaign with second places in Brabantse Pijl and the Amstel Gold Race, Healy lit up the Giro with boundless energy and abandon. His win on Stage 8 over two ascents of I Cappuccini was the result of a 50km solo breakaway.

Second places on Stage 10, 14 and 19 may have thrust him into a Sep Vanmarcke style always-the-bridesmaid position, but his enthralling persistence on a day-to-day level earned him three combativity awards and the overall prize to boot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.
