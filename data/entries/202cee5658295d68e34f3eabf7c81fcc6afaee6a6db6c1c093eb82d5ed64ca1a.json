Google holds about a one-quarter share of smart speaker devices, while Apple and Facebook have the small remaining share.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nJosh Lowitz, CIRP partner and co-founder, said that while the installed base of smart speakers added over 25 million units over the past year, reaching a total of 126 million units, Apple still \"failed to make meaningful inroads.\" According to Lowitz, Apple's original <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> strategy, \"with a single premium-priced model competing against products that included low-priced entry-level devices\" struggled to gain a significant share of sales, which has led to other brands growing faster and establishing a grip on consumers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLast year, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/\">discontinued the original HomePod</a> and introduced the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>, a smaller smart speaker priced at just $99. In spite of the launch of the ‌HomePod mini‌, CIRP's data shows little change between Apple's market share in 2020 and 2021.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/smart-speaker-market-share-2021-cirp.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nCIRP estimates that over 20 million U.S. households have more than one Amazon Echo device, while about eight million U.S. households have multiple Google Home units, meaning that 43 percent of Amazon Echo owners and 38 percent of Google Home owners have more than one smart speaker. By comparison, only two million households have more than one ‌HomePod‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is rumored to be rethinking its smart home strategy, scrapping an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/29/apple-no-longer-planning-new-2022-homepod/\">updated model for 2022</a>, and introducing new ‌HomePod‌ models, including one <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/\">with a screen and a camera</a> for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> calls and one that is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/gurman-combined-homepod-apple-tv-in-development/\">combined with an Apple TV</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCIRP's latest data was based on a survey of 500 U.S. owners of Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Apple ‌HomePod‌, surveyed from July 1 to July 8, 2021, who owned one of these devices as of June 30, 2021. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cirp/\">CIRP</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/04/apple-largely-absent-in-smart-speaker-market/\">Apple Remains 'Largely Absent' in U.S. Smart Speaker Market</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-remains-largely-absent-in-u-s-smart-speaker-market.2306487/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=IGqvweStrRs:oqVOQFSFqwA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=IGqvweStrRs:oqVOQFSFqwA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/IGqvweStrRs\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"202cee5658295d68e34f3eabf7c81fcc6afaee6a6db6c1c093eb82d5ed64ca1a","category":"Apple"}
