They’re probably identical inside. But they’re better in three significant ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, they come in colors. Apple’s basic charge cables are only white. The Beats cables come in black, navy, red, and a sort of sandstone color. Color is good! (Some colors are not available in some cable types, though.) Second, they’re longer. Apple’s $19 cable is 1 meter (39.5 inches). The Beats cable is 1.5 meters (59 inches). It makes a big difference.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-length.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"beats cable length\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-length.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3407w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-length.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-length.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-length.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-length.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-length.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-length.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-length.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>The Beats cable is 50% longer than the Apple-branded one.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, they’re probably a little more reliable. Both cables are braided, which is nice, but the Apple cable goes straight from the connector to the cable while the Beats cable has a little half-inch sleeve. This should help keep it from bending too sharply right next to the connector, which is a primary cause of cables splitting over time.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-sleeve.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Beats cable sleeve\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-sleeve.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2998w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-sleeve.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-sleeve.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-sleeve.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-sleeve.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-sleeve.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-sleeve.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beats-cable-sleeve.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Beats cables distinguish themselves in a few other ways. First, you can get the USB-C to USB-C or USB-A to USB-C cables in a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F1W2XPQW/\">two-pack for $35</a> (but only in black). Apple-branded cables are only sold separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also only available in black are neat little 20cm (8 inches) short cables, in USB-A to USB-C, USB-C to USB-C, and USB-C to Lightning. They are still $19 despite the tiny length, but if you plug in a battery pack or portable drive a lot (especially inside a backpack or purse), a very short cable can really reduce clutter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple-branded cables still have their place. If you want really high-power charging support for your laptop, you’ll want to step up to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCH5B2HF/\">Apple’s 240W cable</a>. Or if you’re moving lots of data between a fast external drive and your Mac, you’ll want a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1X6LM9K\">Thunderbolt 4</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLBSYR55/\">Thunderbolt 5</a> cable. These new Beats cables don’t cover any of that ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if all you really need is a good USB cable for charging your iPhone, iPad, MacBook, or headphones and maybe moving around a bit of data on occasion, and you don’t trust third-party cables (of which there are <em>so many</em>), you should go grab the Beats cable over the Apple-branded ones. You can <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MDGK4LL/A/beats-usb-c-to-lightning-woven-cable-15-m-5-ft-bolt-black\">even grab ’em at the Apple Store</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5db03888223dc0168b1051107426a0e683dfdc958257e5b060450fcdafb8b8b4","category":"Apple"}
