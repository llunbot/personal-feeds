Torrance is located in the South Bay region of Los Angeles County.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe permits reveal that Apple will be located on the main level of the mall, between Lululemon and Madewell. The store will be taking over the combined space of two side-by-side units previously occupied by J.Crew and Chico's.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman was first to report on Apple's plans for the store in June, after obtaining the company's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/01/apple-store-update-plans/\">internal roadmap for retail expansion</a>. Apple estimated that the store would open in March 2024, per the roadmap, but this timeframe is subject to change based  on completion of construction, hiring, and other factors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also moving forward with plans to relocate its store at the Square One shopping mall in Mississauga, Ontario, west of Toronto in Canada. Apple will be taking over a space previously occupied by Massimo Dutti on the second floor of the mall, above the food court, according to a building permit filed with the city in June.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast, a building permit filed with Gwinnett County in May confirms that Apple plans to relocate its store at the Mall of Georgia in Buford, northeast of Atlanta. The new store will remain in the mall, but the permit did not reveal a specific location.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple estimated that the new Square One and Mall of Georgia stores would open in late 2023, based on the roadmap, but the projects are taking longer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this month, Apple confirmed that it will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apples-infinite-loop-store-closing-next-month/\">permanently closing its Infinite Loop store</a> in Cupertino, California on January 20.
