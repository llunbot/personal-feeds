{"title":"Juli Clover Limited Her iPhone 15 Pro Max to the 80 Percent Charging Limit for an Entire Year","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/24/iphone-80-percent-charging-test/","date":1727217656000,"content":"\n<p>Juli Clover, MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With the iPhone 15 models that came out last year, Apple added an\nopt-in battery setting that limits maximum charge to 80 percent.\nThe idea is that never charging the iPhone above 80 percent will\nincrease battery longevity, so I kept my iPhone at that 80 percent\nlimit from September 2023 to now, with no cheating.</p>\n\n<p>My iPhone 15 Pro Max battery level is currently at 94 percent with\n299 cycles. For a lot of 2024, my battery level stayed above 97\npercent, but it started dropping more rapidly over the last couple\nof months. I left my iPhone at that 80 percent limit and at no\npoint turned the setting off or tweaked it. [...] You can compare\nyour level battery to mine, but here are a couple other metrics\nfrom MacRumors staff that also have an iPhone 15 Pro Max and did\nnot have the battery level limited.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Current capacity: 87%. Cycles: 329</li>\n<li>Current capacity: 90%. Cycles: 271</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My year-old iPhone 15 Pro (not Max) which I simply used every day and charged to 100 percent overnight: max capacity: 89 percent, 344 charge cycles.</p>\n\n<p>I’m so glad Clover ran this test for a year and reported her results, because it backs up my assumption: there’s no practical point to limiting your iPhone’s charging capacity. All you’re doing is preventing yourself from ever enjoying a 100-percent-capacity battery. Let the device manage its own battery. Apple has put a lot of engineering into making that really smart.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/24/clover-iphone-15-battery-limit\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a62e3fad964e42bec4dc7f6dded20056d2b2ea9671214ee2d9a20f028f78cc91","category":"Tech"}
