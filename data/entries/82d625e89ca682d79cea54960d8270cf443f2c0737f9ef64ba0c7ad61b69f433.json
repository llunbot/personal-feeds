The next iPad Air is expected to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/20/new-ipad-air-models-with-m3-chip-leak/\">powered by the M3 chip</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/13/spring-ipad-air-refresh-m4-chip/\">or M4 chip</a>, while the iPad 11 is rumored to be equipped <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/ipad-11-with-a16-chip-identifier-leak/\">with an A16 Bionic chip</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/ipad-11-rumored-specs/\">or A17 Pro chip</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the iPad Pro, do not expect a new model until Apple announces the M5 chip.
