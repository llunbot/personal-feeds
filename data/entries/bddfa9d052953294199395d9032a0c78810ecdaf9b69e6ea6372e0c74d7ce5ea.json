This is especially true for things that are impossible to know, like when will SpaceX land a Starship on Mars?

Starship is a revolutionary design, with the goal of becoming a rapidly reusable rocket that could fly thousands of times per year. It's also the largest rocket ever built, with at least twice the thrust of NASA's Saturn V rocket from the Apollo program more than 50 years ago. Musk described Starship on Thursday as a \"generalized transport system to anywhere in the Solar System.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973540#p3\">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973540&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bddfa9d052953294199395d9032a0c78810ecdaf9b69e6ea6372e0c74d7ce5ea","category":"Tech"}
