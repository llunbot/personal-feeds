Unlocking an app would require Face ID authentication, and it is likely that the feature will also work with Touch ID or an iPhone's passcode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have not confirmed if the feature will work with third-party apps from the App Store.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple already allows certain content to be locked behind Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode, such as notes in the Notes app and photos in the \"Recently Deleted\" and \"Hidden\" albums in the Photos app. This new iOS 18 feature will take things further by allowing for apps to be locked entirely, even if the iPhone is unlocked overall.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone users have already found ways to lock apps with Screen Time or Shortcuts, but these methods will no longer be necessary on iOS 18.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will unveil iOS 18 during its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-wwdc-2024-keynote-june-10/\">WWDC keynote on Monday</a>. The first iOS 18 beta will likely be made available to Apple Developer Program members immediately after the keynote, and the update should be widely released in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/08/ios-18-face-id-app-locking-rumor/\">iOS 18 Will Let You Lock Apps Behind Face ID, Sources Say</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-will-let-you-lock-apps-behind-face-id-sources-say.2428496/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"440d66e4a47f5faf6ffc093972258eae317b5c378cee0772b4b6550dd470b83a","category":"Apple"}
