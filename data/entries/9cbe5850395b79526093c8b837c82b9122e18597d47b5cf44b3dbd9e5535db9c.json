I can’t remember if I stumbled upon it myself on Amazon or if a DCR reader pointed me at it. Either way, way-back-when, I ordered it and have been using it on and off over the last while.

Just like Garmin’s own charging cables. I have more of those than I can count, including many of the newerish USB-C ones, even one right next to me that barely holds on to the watch. But instead of Garmin’s own charging cables costing $20-$25, most 3rd-party charging cables/situations are like 2-4 units for $9.</p>\n<p>In any event…back to this mini battery pack. Here’s what’s in the box:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_9961.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_9961.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_9961.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_9961-200x113.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_9961-720x405.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_9961-124x70.jpg 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_9961-768x432.jpg 768w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_9961-300x169.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>The thing is roughly the size of a square Oreo, if square Oreos were to exist. For better or worse, they don’t.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1962.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1962.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1962.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1962-200x113.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1962-720x405.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1962-124x70.jpg 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1962-768x432.jpg 768w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1962-300x169.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>It’s a bit chunkier in thickness though, but it does have a leash. In thinking about it, I could see a leash being debatably useful for dunking Oreos in milk. Food for thought.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1981.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1981-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1981-1.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1981-1-200x150.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1981-1-720x540.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1981-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></p>\n<p>The specs on the unit are 1,200mAh, meaning that with most Garmin watches having about a 300-500mAh battery (depending on the unit/case size), so something like a Fenix 8 47mm, you’d be able to charge roughly 3-4 times.</p>\n<p><img title=\"vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h16m10s033.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h16m10s033.png\" alt=\"Vlcsnap 2026 01 21 18h16m10s033.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h16m10s033.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h16m10s033-200x113.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h16m10s033-720x405.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h16m10s033-124x70.png 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h16m10s033-768x432.png 768w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h16m10s033-300x169.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>In my testing, after topping off the battery bank and then fully charging an empty Fenix 8 Pro 47mm, it showed 2/3rds battery remaining (but the battery indicators are only 3 dots, so fairly imprecise). It has a USB-C port on the side and an LED battery indicator too. There’s also a button to start charging. In terms of charging time for the battery pack itself, it appears to be about 1 hour and 15 minutes, based on discharging it fully, and then watching as it charges to steady-blue LEDs.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1977.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1977.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1977.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1977-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1977-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1977-768x512.jpg 768w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1977-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>So when it comes to using it, you simply plop your watch onto it, and off it goes. In most cases, this works fine for all the units I’ve stuck on it thus far:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1979.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1979.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1979.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1979-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1979-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1979-768x512.jpg 768w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1979-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>However, it won’t hold on there permanently if jostled. It’s not MagSafe or such. You can wrap the watch around the unit, like your wrist, and that works for watches with slightly smaller straps (like the Garmin Bounce 2), but for longer straps, I find even on the tightest option, there’s still a bit of play there, which would get bonked if in a backpack or such.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1984.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1984.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1984.jpg 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1984-200x133.jpg 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1984-720x480.jpg 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1984-768x512.jpg 768w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/IMG_1984-300x200.jpg 300w\" /></p>\n<p>Now, you can use hair ties or rubber bands to make it stay there, which is what I do. With three daughters and a wife, I’ve got more of these things floating about than I could ever count. I fail to understand how my daughters can go to school each day with their hair in a ponytail, another one or two on their wrists, and then return home with none and their hair removed from said ponytail. All with no knowledge of how that happened. Point being, the only way to hold the watch on there during movement is with some sort of rubber band/hair tie.</p>\n<p>When it comes to charging, I charged two Fenix 8 Pro 48mm watches side-by-side from zero, and they charged at exactly the same rate from start to finish. Garmin’s newer watches take roughly an hour to get most of the way there (~90%, quite linear charging), before trickle charging the remaining/final 10% over roughly another 25-30 minutes. Older watches take 3-5 business days to complete charging, regardless of method. Either way, all of them charge with very low power demands compared to a phone or laptop, so all of this is relatively trivial.</p>\n<p><img title=\"vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h18m11s862.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h18m11s862.png\" alt=\"Vlcsnap 2026 01 21 18h18m11s862.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h18m11s862.png 1440w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h18m11s862-200x113.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h18m11s862-720x405.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h18m11s862-124x70.png 124w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h18m11s862-768x432.png 768w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2026/01/vlcsnap-2026-01-21-18h18m11s862-300x169.png 300w\" /></p>\n<p>When it comes to charging the pod itself, you’d do that via USB-C cable. Which gets to my first annoyance – I can’t use the same port to charge other devices. Meaning, I can’t use the Garmin watch charging bank to randomly charge anything else via that USB-C port. Which would make it *MUCH* more interesting as a backup battery bank in a hiking bag or such. When I’m hiking on multi-day treks, I generally keep a smaller power bank in my bag, which I literally mark with tape as emergency use only. It’s specifically designed in case my other battery bank (and phone) dies, and then I specifically get myself in trouble and need my phone. It’s not for simply charging my phone because I need to take more photos. It’s there as an emergency backup.</p>\n<p>All of which then segues into the last challenge here: Given the sorta-chunky size, and price, limited holding strength, and relatively limited capacity, it seems to make *far* more sense to just get a lipstick power bank, even one with a built-in USB-C cable, and then a Garmin to USB-C adapter if you wanted to.</p>\n<p>Which isn’t to say there is no audience for this unit. For example, there are two core use cases I see:</p>\n<p>1) The first case is actually myself, though I only just realized this. The Garmin Bounce kids’ watches last about 2 days, which means you charge them every other night. If we forget, and don’t realize it till the morning, it’s often too late to charge it enough to get through all the kids’ afterschool activities. Whereas this solves that, because I can throw this in the backpack (with a hair tie), and they’re good to go.</p>\n<p>2) The second case is simply when you might not want someone else stealing your power bank and discharging it (e.g., within your family). Given this *ONLY* charges Garmin watches, and won’t charge anything else, it kinda limits power-bank-theft (by other family members). Kinda like making your food too spicy for others in your family to enjoy.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, I think just <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3NVUtfp\">lipstick-size chargers</a> are probably the way to go, since they are multipurpose.</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for reading!</p><div>\n<h3>Found This Post Useful?
