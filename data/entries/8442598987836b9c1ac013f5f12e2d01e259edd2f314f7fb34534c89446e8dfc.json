That all changes next month, when a TV series finally launches on Hulu. The news came in the form of a trailer that shows off the series' stars while explaining its peculiar twist on a society-crushing disease.</p>\n<p>The original comics, written by former <em>Lost</em> writer/producer Brian K. Vaughan (also involved with beloved comic series like <em>Saga</em> and <em>Paper Girls</em>), revolved around the simultaneous death of everything on Earth with a Y chromosome, humans and animals alike. Thursday's new trailer recaps the same premise by focusing on the president of the United States succumbing to a bloody collapse, followed by apparently every other man on the planet... save one.</p>\n<p>That man, Yorick Brown (played by Ben Schnetzer), begins making his way across a decimated United States, and this TV version matches the comics by including his pet monkey named Ampersand (who also has a Y chromosome). Meanwhile, his mother, Senator Jennifer Brown (played by Diane Lane), apparently assumes control as president of the United States. That's a twist on the original comics, which had Yorick's mother in Congress but not necessarily promoted to the top of the pecking order.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785300#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785300&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8442598987836b9c1ac013f5f12e2d01e259edd2f314f7fb34534c89446e8dfc","category":"Tech"}
