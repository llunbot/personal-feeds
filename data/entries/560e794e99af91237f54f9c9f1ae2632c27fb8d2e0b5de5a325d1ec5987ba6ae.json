Its pro-spec RSL Knit shoes, as you’d guess, have a knitted upper. They’re available in white and silver, if black and gold is a bit too bling for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RSL Road shoes share many of the RSL Knit’s features but have a more standard TPU upper and black or white colour options. There’s also an update of the Velocis shoes, which move to the Trek label.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK price for the Trek RSL Knit shoes is £399.99, while the RSL Pro shoes cost £349.99. The price of the Velocis shoes is a little more affordable at £229.99.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-tech-leaks\">All the cycling tech leaked by the pros in 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-shoe-fit\">Cycling shoe fit: Everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-shoes-for-summer\">Best cycling shoes for summer 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-fit-and-adjust-cleats-for-cycling-shoes\">How to fit and adjust cleats for cycling shoes (video)</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>New pro last and new features</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"649\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Trek-RSL-Knit-shoes-970x649.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Trek-RSL-Knit-shoes-970x649.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Trek-RSL-Knit-shoes-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Trek-RSL-Knit-shoes-768x514.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Trek-RSL-Knit-shoes-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Trek-RSL-Knit-shoes-2048x1371.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Trek-RSL-Knit-shoes-750x502.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Trek-RSL-Knit-shoes-1140x763.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Trek-RSL-Knit-shoes-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Trek-RSL-Knit-shoes-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Trek</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>RSL stands or Race Shop Limited and denotes Trek’s top spec kit. All three new shoes feature the same last, which Trek says will fit better on a wider range of riders’ feet and incorporate zones designed to stretch for greater comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Trek has previously marketed its shoes under the Bontrager name, the new shoes mark a change to labelling them Trek. It had recently done the same with its latest<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/trek-ballista-velocis-mips-helmet-2023\" target=\"_blank\"> helmets</a>. Does this mark a retreat from the Bontrager brand, which it previously used for its components and accessories, or will Bontrager be redirected to Trek’s hardware or its less premium lines? </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trek RSL Knit shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-56782-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-56782-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-56782-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-56782-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-56782-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-56782-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-56782-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-56782-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-56782-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-56782-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-56782-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Trek</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-tech-leaks\" target=\"_blank\">spotted the Trek RSL Knit shoes</a> (in white) on the feet of Mads Pedersen at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a> team’s recent training camp. Now Trek has officially launched the new shoes, which come in a white/silver or the seriously bling (until you scuff the soles) black/gold colour option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new shoes feature what Trek calls Metnet relief zones, which it claims stretch with the foot to help relieve foot discomfort. They sit within reinforced areas around the twin Boa dials, with Trek stating that the variable densities to the knitted polyester fabric provide both performance and comfort. The brand claims that the uppers offer high breathability for better foot temperature management than a traditional upper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shoe’s last is an update on the Bontrager InForm Pro last, which Trek says improves the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-shoe-fit\" target=\"_blank\">fit </a>for the shape and width of Joe Average’s foot. There’s an integral sock liner and an insole made from a naturally derived, part-recycled fabric.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-568001-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-568001-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-568001-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-568001-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-568001-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-568001-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-568001-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-568001-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-568001-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-568001-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/TK23-RSL-Road-Mesh-568001-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Trek</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Closure uses two Boa Li2 dials with bidirectional tension adjustment, which are becoming the de facto standard on top spec <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-shoes-for-summer\" target=\"_blank\">cycling shoes</a>. They also feature on the just-released <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/specialized-propero-4-helmet\" target=\"_blank\">update to the Specialized Torch 3.0 shoes</a>. Trek says that its shoes’ heel cup is designed for improved hold on the heel and better pedalling efficiency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the bottom, Trek has a carbon sole that it rates 14/14 on its stiffness index.

They too include two Boa Li2 dial closures, a heel cup with a non-slip lining and the same Rise by Bloom natural foam liner as the Trek RSL Knit shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also the same Metnet relief zones built into the uppers to add extra stretch, while the front of the uppers and the tongue are perforated for ventilation.

They too feature Metnet relief zones to increase foot comfort, forefoot and tongue venting and two Boa Li2.
