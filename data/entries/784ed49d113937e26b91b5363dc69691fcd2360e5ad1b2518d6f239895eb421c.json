The minimum standard capacity for a practical water bottle should be 500ml</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Squeezability:</strong> You want a bottle that’s flexible enough to deliver a good gulp when you squeeze it, plus boost the flow rate at the valve </span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Flow rate:</strong> Works with the squeeze of the bottle to make for easy drinking, even when you’re on your bike</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Nozzle:</strong> Does it lock? Nozzles with a tight closure will mean fewer leaks, whatever terrain you’re riding. Sports caps give you no-hands control over the bottle’s opening and closing. It’s also a good idea to have a nozzle cap, particularly when mountain biking, so that it stays free from splatters</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Neck width:</strong> The wider the better. This allows more space for adding energy powders, plus it will be easier to negotiate taps and fountains when filling. It also makes it easier to clean</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Grippiness:</strong> For drinking on the go, a bottle with a textured outer will be easier to grip with sweaty or wet hands</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Insulation:</strong> Bottles with insulation will keep your drink colder for longer or, on truly cold days, it can stop it freezing</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Guarantee:</strong> Is there a guarantee with your water bottle, and if so, how long does it last?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other ways to stay hydrated while cycling</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Camelbak Lobo 9L hydration pack for mountain bikers\" title=\"Camelbak Lobo 9L pack - 05\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A Camelbak is another way to stay hydrated while cycling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy McCandlish / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Whether you’re riding a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/what-is-a-sportive/\">sportive</a> or in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-in-hot-weather/\">hot weather</a>, it’s always important to drink plenty of fluids.</p>\n<p>A water bottle isn’t always the most convenient way to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/how-to-stay-hydrated-on-your-bike/\">stay hydrated while cycling</a>, however.
