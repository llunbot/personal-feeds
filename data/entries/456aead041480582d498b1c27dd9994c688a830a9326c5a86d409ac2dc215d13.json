You obviously can’t watch anything yet, but the streaming page is up, which means you can bookmark it or choose to be notified when the event begins. You can even embed the page in an article, as we’ve done below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At this early stage the page is just a placeholder, but that doesn’t mean you can’t glean any information from it. Most obviously the page informs interested parties when the keynote will begin (and cleverly, the time displayed will match your location; there’s no need to convert from the usual Pacific Time). It also drops the event’s tagline, “sleek peek,” which we’re taking as confirmation that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2800813/if-you-still-need-convincing-apple-just-confirmed-that-major-ui-changes-are-coming-at-wwdc.html\">major UI changes are coming</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Apple has also published a second WWDC 2025 streaming page, which is linked in the description of the one above: this time it’s the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/51iONeETSng\">Platforms State of the Union</a>, which takes place on the evening of June 9. This will be a more niche technical presentation than the main keynote but may be of interest to hardcore fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WWDC 25 we expect to hear about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575705/ios-19-features-release-date-beta.html\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2644146/macos-16-release-beta-features-compatibility.html\">macOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2766625/ipados-19-release-date-compatilbity-features-beta.html\">iPadOS 26</a>, and much more. We’ll be covering all the announcements as they happen, so if you’d like to hear independent critical analysis of the new software updates rather than just the marketing spiel, keep an eye on our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/wwdc\">WWDC 2025 topic zone</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"456aead041480582d498b1c27dd9994c688a830a9326c5a86d409ac2dc215d13","category":"Apple"}
