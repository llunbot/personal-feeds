Sarto describes the treatment as a “<em>product of their ongoing innovation sessions designed to explore creative applications of carbon fibre</em>“. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-frameset-waterfall-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-frameset-waterfall-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Sarto Raso Blue Marble, custom aero road bike frameset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-frameset-waterfall-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-frameset-waterfall-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-frameset-waterfall-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-frameset-waterfall-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-frameset-waterfall-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarto likes the sound of describing the look as Black Marble. But in fact as you could guess from that first image, black is only one of several possible colors with the new finish. The new process allows for transparent dyes in this new uppermost layer of carbon. And in fact, color does the marbled look better justice. It better highlights the variation in the fibers and how light reflects off of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How is it made?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_marble-toptube-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_marble-toptube-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Sarto Marble UD carbon finish detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_marble-toptube-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_marble-toptube-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_marble-toptube-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_marble-toptube-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_marble-toptube-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_marble-toptube-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Made entirely in-house, the Marble look is the result of adding an extra ultra-thin layer of Italian-made BU45 unidirectional carbon fiber on the outside of the otherwise complete carbon frame tubes. While the rest of the carbon tube-layup is governed by ultra precision to attain the desire strength &amp; stiffness requirements of the bikes design, this more handmade layer varies from frame to frame. And thus, the resulting fiber patterning out of the mold subsequently is varied, making the finish of every frame, fork &amp; seatpost a one-of-a-kind. Sarto calls it a “<em>playful ‘surprise me’ element</em>” that fits perfectly with their overall bespoke approach to frame building.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-marble-pattern-detail-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-marble-pattern-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Sarto Marble bespoke UD carbon finish boosts strength style, rear detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-marble-pattern-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-marble-pattern-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-marble-pattern-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-marble-pattern-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-marble-pattern-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-marble-pattern-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-marble-pattern-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We’re always thinking of ways we can play with the look of our frames, with elements that perhaps only we can innovate as fibre-to-finish bike makers.

bonus of that extra layer – even though bespoke aesthetics had been the initial goal – the Marble finish does in fact increased the strength and durability of the carbon frame, at very little additional weight. And Sarto’s testing show the thin UD fiber reinforcement also enhanced the bike’s vibration resistance, calling that “<em>a welcome bonus</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-rear-end-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-rear-end-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Sarto Marble bespoke UD carbon finish boosts strength style, angled rear end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-rear-end-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-rear-end-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-rear-end-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-rear-end-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_blue-rear-end-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sarto Marble – Options, Pricing &amp; Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Black-Marble-frameset-angled-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Black-Marble-frameset-angled-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Sarto Raso Black Marble, custom aero road bike frameset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Black-Marble-frameset-angled-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Black-Marble-frameset-angled-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Black-Marble-frameset-angled-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Black-Marble-frameset-angled-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Black-Marble-frameset-angled-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, the Sarto Marble finish is only available now on their <a href=\"https://www.sartobikes.com/en/journal/introducing-raso-marble\" target=\"_blank\">custom-made Raso</a> aero road bike. And Sarto offers it in Blue, Green, or standard Black Marble. Upcharge for the Marble finish on the Raso frameset is an extra +350€ over the basic 300€ mono color paint scheme, with the colored dye options adding another +500€ on top of that. Add all of that to the 5160€ stock geometry or 7350€ full custom geo Raso frame kit (carbon frame, fork, headset, spacers, stem, handlebar, seatpost, 2 bottle cages &amp; thru-axles).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new look is a structural adaptation to the carbon itself, so Sarto can combine it with other paint options, too. Like this black frame that matches silver-painted marbled graphics to the downtube logo. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-non-driveside-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-non-driveside-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Sarto Raso Blue Marble, custom aero road bike frameset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-non-driveside-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-non-driveside-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-non-driveside-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-non-driveside-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-non-driveside-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-non-driveside-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_Blue-Marble-non-driveside-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarto also can adapt the extent of Marble tube finish to each buyer’s desire. For example, if you only wanted a marbled front triangle. All of this adds up to the fact that Sarto sees this as a flexible finish option going forward on any of their carbon tubes. That suggests to us that in the future the Marble carbon finish will likely be possible on their other road and gravel bike models, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_complete-bike-build-example-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_complete-bike-build-example-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Sarto Raso Black Marble, custom aero road bike with handmade bespoke UD carbon finish\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_complete-bike-build-example-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_complete-bike-build-example-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_complete-bike-build-example-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_complete-bike-build-example-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sarto-Marble-bespoke-UD-carbon-finish-boosts-strength-style_complete-bike-build-example-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, you can get an aero road Sarto Raso road bike in any of the new Marble finishes, with lead times of around 90 working days to craft a custom bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.sartobikes.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">SartoBikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sarto-black-marble-adds-strength-beauty-to-your-italian-custom-carbon-raso-road-bike/\">Sarto Black Marble Adds Strength &amp; Beauty to Italian Custom Carbon Raso Aero Road Bike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0f18b538553cd91bc7df99639b4aac7610eb6b6996050b6290de2494c4619f7c","category":"Cycling"}
