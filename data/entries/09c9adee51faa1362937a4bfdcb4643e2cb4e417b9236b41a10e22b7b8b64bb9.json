Initially limited to emergency use, satellite texting expanded in iOS 18 to support messages to any contact.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman says Apple aims to make this feature a key selling point for the third-generation Ultra, expected in September 2025. It also positions the device to better compete with brands like Garmin, which offer satellite-equipped gear for remote and rugged environments. Gurman first reported on the upcoming features <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-10/apple-plans-apple-watch-ultra-3-next-year-with-satellite-texting-and-5g\">last December</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nDesigned for adventurers, divers, and hikers, the Ultra will gain a new safety edge with off-grid communication capabilities. Satellite access remains free for now on supporting iPhones, which include two years of coverage. Apple is expected to offer the same for the Ultra.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman also reports that Apple plans to move away from Intel cellular modems in future Watch models, shifting to MediaTek. MediaTek's chip supports 5G RedCap â€“ a low-power, mid-speed version of 5G tailored for wearables. Current Apple Watch models still use 4G LTE, despite iPhones having adopted 5G years ago.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/2025-apple-watch-ultra-5g-satellite-texting/\">2025 Apple Watch Ultra to Support 5G and Satellite Texting</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2025-apple-watch-ultra-to-support-5g-and-satellite-texting.2453947/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"09c9adee51faa1362937a4bfdcb4643e2cb4e417b9236b41a10e22b7b8b64bb9","category":"Apple"}
