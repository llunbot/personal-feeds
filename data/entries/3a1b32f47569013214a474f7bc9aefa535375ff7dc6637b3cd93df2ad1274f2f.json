of this article, I get first picks, so if anyone else has the same selection they’ve copied me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Red jersey: Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I predicted this in our favourites article so I had to commit. There has been far too much hype for the deep start list at this race so it’s almost certainly been jinxed. Jumbo-Visma will win the opening team time-trial, the jersey will be passed onto Primož Roglič after the uphill finish on Stage 2 and Jonas Vingegaard will take it on Stage 10’s individual time-trial and never let go. History is written.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Green jersey: Iván García Cortina (Movistar)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vuelta is never good for sprinters, not only are the flat stages a rarity but the riders actually have to make it through the three weeks of monster climbs and <em>rampas inhumanas</em>. The five winners of this jersey are Mads Pedersen, Fabio Jakobsen, Primož Roglič, Primož Roglič and Alejandro Valverde for goodness sake. That’s why Movistar are in luck, the sprint field is very thin and Iván García Cortina can climb, as proven with very good results in the Classics, so he’ll take the biggest result of his career here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Polka dot jersey: Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The sheer difficulty of this Vuelta necessitates that the winner of the mountains classification will probably come from the GC favourites and I don’t see Roglič being that far behind Vingegaard overall but he does have a stronger sprint and always goes for the bonus seconds, so he should take this one. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>White jersey: Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Defending champion Remco Evenepoel has already started downplaying his chances of winning and his Soudal-QuickStep team are minnows compared to the might of Jumbo-Visma so probably wise to lower the expectations. That doesn’t mean he’ll have a big drop off though, I still think he’ll podium and to win the young riders’ classification he just needs to hold off UAE Team Emirates’ Juan Ayuso.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus prediction: Groupama-FDJ’s young stars to shine</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Six out of Groupama-FDJ’s eight riders are eligible for the white jersey, the other two are 26 and 33 (sorry Rudy Molard, you’re an old man now). Not only are they young though, they’re also super talented. Lenny Martinez and Romain Grégoire are two of France’s next generation of Grand Tour hopes and in their debut seasons are already making their mark, Martinez will top ten GC and maybe challenge for a stage and/or the polka dot jersey, Grégoire will win a stage. Storer (the 26-year-old) has won multiple Vuelta stages in the past and he’ll get another. Sam Watson and Lewis Askey are two of Britain’s best young riders and will be looking to light up breakaways on the flat or hilly stages. Watson will win a stage. The rest of them will get into breakaways and Molard has a shot at a stage. Arnaud who?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Robyn Davidson, editorial assistant</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/01/07125837/romain_bardet_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"romain_bardet_1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/01/07125837/romain_bardet_1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/01/07125837/romain_bardet_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/01/07125837/romain_bardet_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/01/07125837/romain_bardet_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/01/07125837/romain_bardet_1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/01/07125837/romain_bardet_1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/01/07125837/romain_bardet_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/01/07125837/romain_bardet_1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/01/07125837/romain_bardet_1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>She’s had a shocking summer of predictions, so don’t put any money on Robyn’s choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Red jersey: Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The co-leader duo of Roglič and Vingegaard will prevent Evenepoel from repeating his Vuelta feat. I can’t imagine we’ll get any drama in the Jumbo-Visma team à la the days of Quintana/Valverde at Movistar to spice up the dynamic, but it would be interesting…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Green jersey: Primož Roglič (Jumbo Visma)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I could say Kaden Groves, but the Vuelta is never really a Grand Tour for the sprinters. Sure, in this edition there are six flatter stages. But two of those have a cheeky uphill finish. I reckon with Vingegaard higher in the GC standings, Roglič can sweep up some points to take home the green – but not the nice green – jersey. A nice consolation prize.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Polka dot jersey: Romain Bardet (DSM-Firmenich)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I just feel it in my bones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>White jersey: Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>How is he still so young?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus prediction: #FreeSeppKuss</h3>\n\n\n\n<h2>Martin James, production editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-hugh-carthy-angliru-2020-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist in pink celebrating\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-hugh-carthy-angliru-2020-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-hugh-carthy-angliru-2020-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-hugh-carthy-angliru-2020-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-hugh-carthy-angliru-2020-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-hugh-carthy-angliru-2020-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-hugh-carthy-angliru-2020-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-hugh-carthy-angliru-2020-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-hugh-carthy-angliru-2020-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-hugh-carthy-angliru-2020-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-hugh-carthy-angliru-2020-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>MIGUEL RIOPA/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin is in absolutely stunning form after going three for four at the Tour de France Femmes, so take note.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Red jersey: Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at the final Tour de France standings and the Vuelta having a quite mental nine summit finishes this year and this might seem like a no-brainer. But it’s not quite so simple. Vingegaard hasn’t raced since the Tour and I’d say it’s likely Jumbo-Visma are planning for him to work for Primož Roglič’s own GC bid instead – pro cycling is a team game after all. Either way they have two massively strong GC options, which brings us back to those nine summit finishes. In that context it’s hard to see past Vingegaard. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Green jersey: Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s Vuelta route isn’t exactly sprinter-friendly – hence a lot of them choosing to stay away – so this is a particularly hard one to predict. But I haven’t mentioned Remco so far, which doesn’t seem right, and his slightly broader skillset in terms of stage finishes that he could claim bigger points in than his GC rivals may just give him the edge. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Polka dot jersey: Romain Bardet (DSM-Firmenich) </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is admittedly a purely nostalgic choice, since all those summit finishes mentioned above could easily see the leading GC rider overall annex the mountains prize almost by default. But let’s face it, that’s a boring way to go, so <em>allez Romain! </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Young rider: Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper this looks like a three-way fight between Evenepoel and UAE Team Emirates duo João Almeida and Juan Ayuso, and of those two Ayuso looks the stronger bet. But Remco in his rainbow (and national) bands seems to be on a different level to either of them, never mind any of the other talented young riders on the start list. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus prediction: Hugh Carthy to do the Angliru double </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hugh Carthy has just a single Grand Tour stage win to his name so far: his epic win on Stage 12 of the 2020 Vuelta up the Alto de l’Angliru. So how amazing would it be to see the EF Education-EasyPost rider win again on the very same climb? Alberto Contador is the only rider to ever win twice on the Angliru, but even he didn’t go back-to-back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pete Muir, editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-bryan-coquard-tour-2023-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist smiles next to crowds\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-bryan-coquard-tour-2023-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-bryan-coquard-tour-2023-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-bryan-coquard-tour-2023-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-bryan-coquard-tour-2023-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-bryan-coquard-tour-2023-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-bryan-coquard-tour-2023-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-bryan-coquard-tour-2023-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-bryan-coquard-tour-2023-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-bryan-coquard-tour-2023-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-bryan-coquard-tour-2023-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As <em>Cyclist</em>‘s big boss, you’d expect Pete to get these spot on.

But then again…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Polka dot jersey: Omar Fraile (Ineos Grenadiers)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With Geraint Thomas looking outgunned for the GC, Fraile is the kind of attacking, get-in-a-break climber/all-rounder who could snaffle a jersey for the British team.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Green jersey: Bryan Coquard (Cofidis)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With so much climbing, and so little on offer for sprinters at this year’s Vuelta, most of the big names have stayed away. Coquard is the best-placed sprinter on the start list according to procyclingstats.com, and he has the endurance to make it to the finish in Madrid.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Young rider: Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>He was third at the Vuelta last year, and he’s barely out of nappies. He’s the next big Spanish sensation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus prediction: One of my predictions will come true</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Under normal circumstances, a prediction of victory from me is the kiss of death for any rider. My hit rate in the last few big races has been poorer than a one-armed archer. If I say someone looks on form, they will ride into a tree the next day. But I’m feeling lucky…</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-espana-predictions-2023\">Cyclist’s 2023 Vuelta a España predictions</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Deputy Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"3a1b32f47569013214a474f7bc9aefa535375ff7dc6637b3cd93df2ad1274f2f","category":"Cycling"}
