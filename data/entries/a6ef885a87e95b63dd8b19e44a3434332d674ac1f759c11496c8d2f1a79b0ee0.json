Apple is working on onscreen awareness, personal context, and the ability to take more actions in and across apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnscreen awareness will let ‌Siri‌ take actions when you ask something about what's on your display. If you're looking at a photo and want to message it to your friend Eric, you'll be able to tell ‌Siri‌ to \"Send this picture to Eric,\" and ‌Siri‌ will understand and do it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPersonal context will let ‌Siri‌ do more with your personal data like emails and messages. This is an on-device feature, and it will let ‌Siri‌ learn more about you, who you're communicating with, and how you use your device. Personal context will let you do things like ask ‌Siri‌ to find a specific message, or remind you when you took a photo that you're looking for.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌Siri‌ option to take more actions in and across apps will drastically improve what ‌Siri‌ is capable of. You'll be able to move files from one app to another and control app functions with ‌Siri‌ that you never could before. It'll work in third-party apps as well as Apple's own apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Sketch Style for Image Playground</h3>\r<br />\nAs of right now, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/\">Image Playground</a> has two different styles to choose from, animation and illustration. There is a third, though, that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/apple-removes-sketch-from-image-playground/\">plans to add in the future</a>. Sketch is described as a \"highly detailed and academic\" style that \"produces gorgeous drawings on stark backgrounds.\" It is distinct from the illustration style that has strong outlines, bold colors, and simple shapes, and the animation style that has a \"whimsical, 3D cartoon look.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/image-wand-styles.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1289\" /><em><div>The animation, illustration, and sketch styles, respectively</div></em>\r<br />\nIf you want to see what the sketch style looks like, you can check it out in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-wand/\">Image Wand</a> feature in the Notes app, where it is available now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>macOS Features</h3>\r<br />\nMemory Maker is in iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, but not <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a> is in iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2, but not ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to release Memory Maker and ‌Genmoji‌ for ‌macOS Sequoia‌ at a later time. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>More Languages</h2>\r<br />\nApple plans to add support for more languages in 2025, including Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese. Apple says that the first \"set\" of new languages will come in a software update in April (likely iOS 18.4), while more will come throughout the year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Intelligence Support in the European Union</h2>\r<br />\nApple plans to start rolling out ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> users in the European Union in April. EU users will officially get access to Writing Tools, ‌Genmoji‌, the updated ‌Siri‌ with better language understanding, ‌Siri‌ ChatGPT integration, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>When to Expect More Apple Intelligence Features</h2>\r<br />\nMore ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features will come in iOS 18.3 and iOS 18.4.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn late January or so, we'll get iOS 18.3, which could potentially have some new ‌Siri‌ features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18.4, which isn't expected until around April 2025, will have the bulk of the ‌Siri‌ ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features. We're also expecting to see Apple roll out support for additional languages in 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Intelligence Device Requirements</h2>\r<br />\n‌Apple Intelligence‌ requires a device with one of Apple's newest chips and at least 8GB RAM. Eligible models are listed below.\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n <li>All <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models</li>\r<br />\n <li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> Pro and ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro Max</li>\r<br />\n <li>All Apple silicon iPads</li>\r<br />\n<li>A17 Pro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></li>\r<br />\n <li>All Apple silicon Macs</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Intelligence Settings</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Privacy and Security section of the Settings app you can access an ‌Apple Intelligence‌ Report that lets you export your ‌Apple Intelligence‌ data as part of Apple's promise for transparency around ‌Apple Intelligence‌. Biometric authentication is required to access and export ‌Apple Intelligence‌ data.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-report.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can also disable ‌Apple Intelligence‌ by toggling off the setting under the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ and ‌Siri‌ section in the Settings app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Intelligence Availability</h2>\r<br />\n‌Apple Intelligence‌ is only available in U.S. English at this time, and it is not available to in the European Union (‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌) or China. Device region and language need to be set to the United States.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn iOS 18.2, localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK is supported in addition to U.S. English. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to add support for additional languages in 2025, like Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese. ‌Apple Intelligence‌ will launch on the ‌iPhone‌ and the ‌iPad‌ in the European Union in April 2025. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-intelligence-features-2025/\">These Apple Intelligence Features Aren't Coming Until 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-apple-intelligence-features-arent-coming-until-2025.2445128/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a6ef885a87e95b63dd8b19e44a3434332d674ac1f759c11496c8d2f1a79b0ee0","category":"Apple"}
