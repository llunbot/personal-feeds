{"title":"‘Hating Everyone Everywhere All at Once at Stanford’","link":"https://popehat.substack.com/p/hating-everyone-everywhere-all-at","date":1679154058000,"content":"\n<p>Ken White, writing at The Popehat Report:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Associate Dean Steinbach and her ilk are campaigning to undermine free speech legal and social norms, striving to make someone’s subjective reaction to speech an unquestionable justification for suppressing it. Academic freedom is under state assault and she’s busily undermining it and telling students they have a right to shut people up.</p>\n\n<p>Stanford, and schools like it, are shitting the bed over controversial speakers. Decide that students can shut down speeches they don’t like, if you want to take that path. If not, protect speakers from disruption and have the students escorted out if they shut down a speech. Don’t half-ass it and then apologize afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>And students. Students think that they should be able to dictate which speakers their peers invite, who can speak, what they can say, and who can listen. They’re not satisfied with the most free-speech-exceptionalist system in the world that lets them respond to speech by assembling, protesting, and reviling people of authority like Judge Duncan. They demand the right not just to speak, but to control the speech of others. That’s straight-up thuggish, an aspiration born of a fascist soul. These are law students. They are training to express themselves for a living. If their view is “we can’t respond to awful speech, we can only stop it from happening,” then they’re going to be terrible lawyers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/18/popehat-stanford\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5949e690601bab9749915870cda11416282fcfebeda7ea5714441cbc48b01a51","category":"Tech"}
