We're just 11 days into the new year, and we've already had two stunning rocket debuts. Vulcan soared into space on Monday morning, and then a medium-lift rocket from China, Gravity-1, made a picture-perfect launch from a mobile pad in the Yellow Sea. It feels like this could be a great year for lift.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

The European Space Agency said it is targeting November 15 for the return to flight of the grounded Avio-built Vega C launch vehicle, <a href=\"https://europeanspaceflight.com/esa-targets-15-november-for-vega-c-return-to-flight-mission/\">European Spaceflight reports</a>. I'll be honest. I had to double-check the calendar to make sure that it is in fact January, because that's an oddly specific date for a launch 10 months from now. But it appears there is some, <em>ahem</em>, flexibility in that date. ESA director of space transportation Toni Tolker-Nielsen says: “The nominal date is 15 November. There is a very detailed plan that is leading to this.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995251#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995251&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9c44e93e975af2daca29ac83ef5788bf63eddb16e20cab6a3ab43f204e34bb4a","category":"Tech"}
