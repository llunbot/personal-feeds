The devices are able to offer this feature because they are equipped with lower-power LTPO OLED displays, whereas the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini have LTPS OLED displays without support for ProMotion.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe lack of ProMotion on at least one iPhone 14 model wouldn't be too surprising, as Apple may keep the feature limited to the Pro models next year to maintain differentiation with the standard iPhone 14 models. Rumors suggest Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2022-iphones-no-mini-upgraded-camera/\">plans to launch four iPhone 14 models next year</a>, including a 6.1-inch iPhone 14, 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Max, 6.1-inch iPhone 14 Pro, and 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Pro Max, with no iPhone 14 mini.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe report adds that LG Display is aiming to start supplying Apple with LTPO OLED displays in 2022, which would give Apple another supplier of ProMotion displays for iPhones beyond Samsung, which is currently its exclusive supplier.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the past, <em>The Elec</em> accurately reported that Apple would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/18/lg-3d-sensing-tof-ipad-pro-march-2020/\">launch a new iPad Pro with a LiDAR Scanner in March 2020</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iPhone-14/\">iPhone 14</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/promotion/\">ProMotion</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/\">The Elec</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/17/at-least-one-iphone-14-likely-60hz/\">At Least One iPhone 14 Model Will Reportedly Still Lack 120Hz ProMotion Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/at-least-one-iphone-14-model-will-reportedly-still-lack-120hz-promotion-display.2311539/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XQBgLNP_89E:Oj2trDC0Xxw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XQBgLNP_89E:Oj2trDC0Xxw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/XQBgLNP_89E\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"59880d16e4d9021c75d80fc4ea011e397ce2d17d7a9131f210255685df3b76ff","category":"Apple"}
