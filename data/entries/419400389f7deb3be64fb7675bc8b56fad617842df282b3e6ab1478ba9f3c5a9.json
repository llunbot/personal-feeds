{"title":"Best Apple Watch: Which Apple Watch to buy in 2023/2024","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/671574/best-apple-watch.html","date":1700497200000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple launched two new Apple Watches in 2023: the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9. Apple also still sells the Apple Watch SE from 2022. With the arrival of the two new Apple Watches, Apple discontinued the Apple Watch 8 and the original Apple Watch Ultra, however, you may still be able to buy those older Apple Watch models from resellers and from <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-671574-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s Refurbished Store</a>. We’ve included the best prices right now for the Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra 1 at the bottom of this article. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this guide, we will help you decide which Apple Watch is best for you. We’ll compare the features, spec and price as well as offer advice on choosing cases, colors and straps in our Apple Watch comparison chart so you can be confident you are choosing the right Apple Watch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what you need to know before buying an Apple Watch. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does an Apple Watch do?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Practically every Apple Watch ever made has offered the same set of basic functions. Apple Watch can be used in conjunction with an iPhone (or separately if the user has a cellular contract) to: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Make or take phone calls </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Read and send text messages</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Read and send emails</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Listen to music or podcasts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Receive notifications relating to iPhone and Apple Watch apps </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use apps, such as Maps for navigation, a calculator or a compass</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Track fitness, including steps and calories burned</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Monitor your health, including heart rate</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Detect a fall or car crash</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tell the time – especially if your watch has an always-on display (they don’t all offer that)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Act as a flashlight (or torch) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pay via Apple Pay </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Track your sleep </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch doesn’t need an iPhone to work, but it helps. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676595/does-an-apple-watch-work-without-an-iphone.html\">Does an Apple Watch work without an iPhone?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s another choice to be made. Do you need an Apple Watch with cellular connectivity or not?  We examine GPS versus cellular in a separate article, read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230395/lte-apple-watch-pros-cons.html\">Should I buy a cellular Apple Watch</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you choose a cellular version of the Apple Watch you’ll be able to leave your iPhone at home and use your Watch for making calls, receiving texts, and streaming music. Apple Watch can also support Family Setup if you are looking for a Watch for someone who doesn’t have an iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch comparison chart</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watches-2023.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watches 2023\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watches-2023.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1216w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watches-2023.jpg?resize=300%2C154&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watches-2023.jpg?resize=768%2C393&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watches-2023.jpg?resize=1200%2C615&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"615\" /><figcaption>The three watches Apple sells as of September 2023.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Apple Watch SE 2</th><th>Apple Watch Series 9</th><th>Apple Watch Ultra 2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Price from</strong></td><td>£219</td><td>£399</td><td>£799</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Screen size</strong></td><td>44mm or 40mm</td><td>45mm or 41mm</td><td>49mm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Display </strong></td><td>1,000 nits</td><td>2,000 nits</td><td>3,000 nits</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>40mm from 26.4g 44mm from 32.9g</td><td>41mm from 31.9g   45mm from 38.7g</td><td>61.4 g</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Materials </strong></td><td>Aluminium</td><td>Aluminium or Stainless Steel</td><td>Titanium</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Colors</strong></td><td>Midnight, Starlight, Silver</td><td>Aluminium: Midnight, Starlight, Silver, Pink, Product Red.

Designed for athletes and adventures it wasn’t the watch for everyone, but it went beyond the standard Apple Watch with features for divers (like depth gage, water temperature sensor, and water resistance to 100 meters) and features for hikers such as precision dual-frequency GPS. It is also constructed from tougher materials: a titanium case and a sapphire crystal cover for the screen. </p>\n\n<p>The Ultra’s battery life is better than the standard series. For the 2022 models, it was up to 36 hours for the Ultra and 18 hours for the Series 8, and those figures are the same for the 2023 models. You can eke out even more battery life too, up to 72 hours in Low Power Mode, but again this is the same as 2022. </p>\n\n<p>As for what’s different in the second-gen Apple Watch Ultra, like the Apple Watch Series 9 the 2023 Ultra features the S9 chip which is superior to the previous generation with 60% more transistors than the S8, a four core Neural Engine that is twice as fast than the S8, and 30 percent faster graphics. You might wonder why you need this power but it allows for things like smoother animations, faster and more accurate dictation, Siri on device and the Double Tap feature. </p>\n\n<p>In 2022 the Apple Watch Ultra screen offered 2,000 nits of brightness. This has now increased to 3,000 nits (while the Series 9 now gets 2,000 nits). This should make it easier to see the screen in bright light, perhaps on the ski slopes. The always-on screen can also turn down to 1 nit so as not to disturb others. </p>\n\n<p>Like the Series 9 the Ultra 2 offers the new U2 Ultra-wideband chip that enables Precision Finding to make it easier to find your iPhone. Rather than just ping with iPhone, you will get navigation instructions on the watch. </p>\n\n<p>The original Ultra has the Action Button, to make controlling the Watch a bit easier, but the second-gen model goes a step further. Thanks to the new Double-Tap gesture you won’t have to touch the screen to control the Watch, useful if your other hand isn’t free. Just tap your thumb and index finger together and the gesture is recognized by the watch (via sensors and algorithms) so that the primary action of what ever app is showing will be triggered. You will also be able to use on-device Siri to do – like ask Siri to open Watch apps or check or input data. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macworld.se/article/2064356/apple-watch-ultra-2.html&amp;xcust=1-1-671574-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Watch Ultra 2 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Watch Series 9\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" alt=\"Apple Watch Series 9\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-carbon-neutral-lineup-230912.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tS9 chip is a real improvement\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tDouble Tap\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tBrighter screen\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo price drop in the U.S.\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $399\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-9-GPS-41mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Loop/5053502765&amp;subid1=1-1-671574-6-2064755-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$349 at  Walmart</a><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facw941sbst.html&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-671574-6-2064755-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$399 at  Adorama</a><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-671574-6-2064755-9934&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us/shop/go/product/MR8Y3\" target=\"_blank\">$399 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>To look at the Apple Watch 9 doesn’t seem all that different to the Apple Watch Series 8, apart from a new pink color option, but it’s what’s on the inside that counts and inside the Apple Watch Series 9 is a much superior processor, double the storage, a second-gen ultra-wideband chip, a brighter screen, and new features like on-device Siri and the Double Touch gesture that means you won’t have to touch the screen. The best news for those outside the U.S. is that the price is lower than the 2022 equivalent. </p>\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 8 (like the second-ten Apple Watch Ultra) features the S9. In 2022 the S8 chip wasn’t a huge improvement on the S7, or even the S6, but this time round the chip has a speed boost, is more power efficient, and boasts 30-percent faster graphics. It also includes a four-core Neural Engine, which allows for new features like Double Tap and on-device Siri. </p>\n\n<p>There’s also the new U2 Ultra-wideband chip which enables a Precision Finding feature if you forget where you left your iPhone. Rather than just ping with iPhone, you will see navigation instructions on the watch.</p>\n\n<p>For 2023 the screen gets an update. It’s brighter than the screen of the Watch 8, up from 1,000 nits to 2,000 nits. (The Apple Watch Ultra had a 2,000 nit screen in 2022 and this time gets 3,000 nits). This should mean it’s easier to see in bright light. The always-on display can also dim to just 1 nit. </p>\n\n<p>Double-Tap and on-device Siri may be the changes that make the biggest difference in how you use the Apple Watch though. You won’t have to touch the screen, useful if your other hand isn’t free. All you do is tap your thumb and index finger together and the gesture is recognized by the watch (via sensors and algorithms). When the Double Tap is detected the primary action of whatever app is showing will be triggered. And, because Siri won’t need to connect to the internet to process your questions you will be able to do more with it – like ask Siri to open Watch apps or check or input data.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2114964/apple-watch-series-9-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Watch Series 9 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Watch SE (2nd generation)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"Apple Watch SE (2nd generation)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/apple-watch-se-2.png\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tCheapest Apple Watch \t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tCrash detection\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tFall detection\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLacks many of the health sensors of the other Watches: no ECG, no O2\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSmaller, cramped screen\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$249 (GPS only)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6539358&amp;u=https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6340237/pdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-671574-6-1062020-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$189 at  Best Buy</a><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-SE-2nd-Gen-GPS-40mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Band-S-M/1409379636&amp;subid1=1-1-671574-6-1062020-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$229 at  Walmart</a><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-40mm-midnight-aluminum-case-with-midnight-sport-band-2022-2nd-generation-s-m%2F-%2FA-85973597&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-671574-6-1062020-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$249.99 at  Target </a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The Apple Watch SE which arrived in 2022 is the second generation SE, with the first being introduced in 2020.  The 2022 Apple Watch SE introduced new features and component improvements compared to the original. Like the Series 8 and subsequent Watches, it offers Crash Detection and an improved Compass app. </p>\n\n<p>The heart sensor in the SE (old and new) is second-generation, while the Series 7 and above offer a third-generation heart sensor. The SE also lacks the temperature sensor for cycle monitoring. You also don’t get Blood Oxygen monitoring or the ability to perform an ECG. </p>\n\n<p>Like the Apple Watch Series 9 the SE comes in two sizes, but the screen is slightly smaller than the screen on the Series 9 (and the Series 8) at 44mm and 40mm, rather than 45mm and 41mm. This means the screen is a little bit more cramped, especially when compared to the Ultra’s 49mm screen. Speaking of the screen, the SE doesn’t offer an always-on display like the other watches, so if that is likely to be a point of frustration for you it’s a good reason to upgrade. </p>\n\n<p>Battery life is the same 18 hours as the Series 9 (and Series 8). </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/1362476/apple-watch-se-2022-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Watch SE (2nd generation) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>How the new Apple watches compare </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s an overview, but in a little more detail here’s how the features of each Apple Watch compare. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Size </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it arrived in 2022 the Apple Watch Ultra was the biggest Apple Watch Apple had ever sold. The 2023 model has the same 49mm case with a screen that is capable of displaying six lines of text, so you can see more information at a glance than you can on the other Apple Watches. The 49mm case allows for a 410 by 502 pixels screen. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-WAtch-ULtra-6-lines.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Bigger screen Apple Watch Ultra\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-WAtch-ULtra-6-lines.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1246w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-WAtch-ULtra-6-lines.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-WAtch-ULtra-6-lines.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-WAtch-ULtra-6-lines.jpg?resize=1200%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-WAtch-ULtra-6-lines.jpg?resize=1240%2C868&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"836\" /><figcaption>You can see more text on the Apple Watch Ultra</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The next largest screen comes with the 45mm Apple Watch Series 9. This screen size was introduced on the Series 7 so we are a few generations in now. The 45mm Watch face is 396 by 484 pixels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to the Series 7, the Series 6 had a 44mm case that had been introduced with the Apple Watch Series 4. It is this case that features on the Apple Watch SE. The 44mm screen means there are 368 by 448 pixels on the display. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone wants a big watch though. If you have slim wrists you might prefer a smaller case, in which case Apple offers a smaller variant of each watch (aside from the Ultra, which only has a 49mm case). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a 41mm case option available for the Series 9 with 352 by 430 pixel screen. The Apple Watch SE offers a 40mm case with 324 by 394 pixels screen. The difference between the screen size in the 45mm model and the 44mm model, and the 41mm model and the 40mm model is a lot larger than the 1mm difference would suggest because Apple extended the size on the display on those Apple Watches. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Design </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be three variants of the Apple Watch in 2023, but there are a number of combinations that mean that there are more design differences than you might expect. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we explained above, there are five sizes to choose from: 49mm, 45mm, 44mm, 41mm and 40mm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the sizes, Apple uses three materials for the cases: aluminium for the Watch SE; aluminium or Stainless Steel for the Series 9; and titanium for the Ultra 2. For each case there is a choice of colors: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Aluminium comes in midnight, starlight, and silver. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stainless Steel is available in graphite, silver, gold and (as of 2023) pink and Product Red </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Titanium is just the one color.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as a choice of case color, you also have a vast choice of straps or bands to go with the Apple Watch, some are only compatible with certain Watch sizes (see: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677788/do-new-apple-watch-straps-fit-all-models.html\">Do Apple Watch straps fit all models?</a> Some add a considerable expense to the cost of the Apple Watch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Ultra has a choice of three straps designed to be rugged and suitable for extreme sports enthusiasts, these new straps can be used with the larger Apple Watches as well. Take a look at all the watch straps on offer on <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-671574-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/watch/bands\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s site</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668488/best-apple-watch-straps.html\">best Apple Watch straps</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675111/new-apple-watch-straps-how-to-find-the-perfect-size.html.\">Apple Watch straps: how to find the perfect size</a> separately. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Durability </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Various elements of the Apple Watch Ultra design help it withstand altitudes, high temperatures, low temperatures, immersion, freeze/thaw, shock, and vibration. So if you want a watch that can be worn at a depth of 40 meters (it’s certified for scuba diving) and is water resistant to 100 metres the Ultra will be the one for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To aid durability the Ultra’s case is made from titanium, which is a much stronger material than the aluminium and Stainless Steel of the Apple Watch 9 (and 8) as well as being corrosion resistant. However, the Apple Watch Series 7, and other Series Watches before it also offered a titanium case, so if you want a more rugged case an older generation Apple Watch might suffice (if you can get your hands on one). The case of the 2022 Apple Watch SE (and the generations before it) is aluminium.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also making the Ultra a little better able to withstand knocks is a sapphire front crystal display, around which raised edges of the case provide protection. The Apple Watch Series 9 (and 8) also features strong sapphire glass on the Stainless Steel models. There’s Ion-X screen glass on the aluminium models. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-Diving.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch Ultra under water diving\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-Diving.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1246w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-Diving.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-Diving.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-Diving.jpg?resize=1200%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-Diving.jpg?resize=1240%2C868&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"836\" /><figcaption>The Apple Watch Ultra can be used by divers </figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>All three watches are “Swimproof”, according to Apple, but they are not equal in this respect. The Apple Watch 9 and SE (and the 8) have a water resistance rating of 50 meters and Apple suggests that they can be used for shallow-water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean. The Apple Watch Ultra has a water resistance rating of 100 meters and includes a Depth gauge and water temperature sensor. With these feature it’s no surprise that Apple states that the Ultra can be used for recreational scuba diving, however Apple adds that “Apple Watch Ultra should not be used for diving below 40 meters” and also points out that “water resistance can diminish over time”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ultra offers the same IP6X dust resistance as the Series 9 (and 8). The SE does’t offer this certification.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Display </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple describes the Apple Watch as being, for example, 44mm, that’s the case size, not the display size. The display area is as follows: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Watch Ultra 2: 49mm, 1164 sq mm display area, 3,000 nits brightness</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 9: 45mm, 1143 sq mm display area, 2,000 nits brightness</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch SE, 44mm, 977 sq mm display area, 1,000 nits brightness</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 9: 41mm, 904 sq mm display area, 2,000 nits brightness</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch SE, 40mm, 759 sq mm display area, 1,000 nits brightness</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the Apple Watch Ultra and the Apple Watch Series 9 (and the Series 8) offer an Always-On display, a feature that was also shared by the Apple Watch Series 5 and later. The Apple Watch SE doesn’t offer an Always-On display. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 Ultra display offers up to 3,000 nits brightness, up from 2,000 in the previous generation. This beats the Series 9, which now has 2,000 nits, and SE which offers 1,000 nits brightness (as did the Series 8). This should make the Ultra easier to read in particularly bright light, for example, when skiing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Health and Safety features </h3>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Watch-health-and-safety-features.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch health and safety features\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Watch-health-and-safety-features.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1246w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Watch-health-and-safety-features.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Watch-health-and-safety-features.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Watch-health-and-safety-features.jpg?resize=1200%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Watch-health-and-safety-features.jpg?resize=1240%2C868&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"836\" /><figcaption>All the Apple Watches offer Car Crash detection, a feature that arrived in 2022. </figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Cycle Tracking: Just like the Series 9 (and 8), the Ultra offers temperature sensing for Cycle Tracking, which was a new feature introduced with the 2022 Watches that should help women trying to get pregnant identify when they have ovulated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blood Oxygen: You’ll also find the Blood Oxygen app (which arrived with the Series 6) in the Ultra and Series 9 Watches. Measuring blood oxygen can alert the wearer to any reduction of oxygen in their bloodstream and can help with management of conditions like asthma. This isn’t available in the SE. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ECG: The Apple Watch 9 and Ultra offer the ECG app (introduced with the Series 4). The 2022 SE can’t perform an ECG (electrocardiogram), but it can notify you of high and low heart rate and irregular heart rhythm, as can the other Watches. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crash Detection:  In 2022 Apple Watches gained the ability to detect a car crash. This feature means that if you are in a severe car crash while wearing any Apple Watch from 2022 or above, the Watch will detect the impact and dial emergency services if you are unresponsive (you’ll get a 10-second warning). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fall Detection: Another safety features that is shared by all the Apple Watches is Fall Detection (the feature arrived with the Apple Watch Series 4). If the watch identifies that you have fallen it will sound an alarm and display an alert so you can confirm if you are ok. If you aren’t ok the watch can call the emergency services. If you don’t have a cellular plan for your Apple Watch you will need your connected iPhone to be nearby for the call to be placed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Siren: This safety feature is unique to the Ultra (1 and 2). That model can play a 86-decibel siren that is audible up to 600 feet (182 meters), handy if you get lost on a mountain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compass &amp; Backtrack: Speaking of mountaineering, the new 2022 Watches gained an improved Compass app with and Backtrack feature that should help you avoid getting lost. The Apple Watch Ultra 9 and 2) could be better at this job though because it features a new dual-frequency GPS that should make it better at positioning you because it won’t be affected by tall trees and buildings. If you are frustrated that your Watch can’t pinpoint your exact location when you are trying to use it for directions amid tall buildings this is a feature for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleep Tracking: The Apple Watches can also track your sleep and wake you up. Since watchOS 8 the Apple Watch has been able to track your breathing rate, notifying you of possible health issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specs </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Chip: The 2023 Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9 both offer the S9 chip. This is the biggest chip upgrade in years. The S8 chip in the SE (as well as in 2022’s Series 8 Apple Watch and the original Ultra) didn’t offer a significant power boost over the S7, which itself wasn’t a lot better than the S6. While the S6 delivered just a 20 percent boost in performance over the Series 5, which launched in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GPS: Both the Apple Watch Series 9 and SE have L1 GPS, while the Apple Watch Ultra (1 and 2) offer Precision dual-frequency (L1 and L5) GPS. L1 GPS is the standard GPS, but it can be blocked by tall buildings and other obstacles. L5 GPS is more advanced and should cope better with buildings blocking the satellite signal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>U2: The Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 both offer an upgraded ultra-wideband chip that will improve their ability to track the location of an object, such as the iPhone 15. This improves on the U1 chip in the Series 8 and Ultra 1. Note the Apple Watch SE is the only Apple Watch that doesn’t even include the U1 chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi connectivity is better in the Series 9 and Ultra: the SE offers only 2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n, while the Apple Watch 8 and Ultra both added 5GHz Wi-Fi to that, as do the 2023 Watches. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch Double Tap\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption>Double Tap on Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch 9 is probably the feature we are most excited about. </figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Battery life </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Ultra 2 offers 36 hour battery life (as did the original Ultra). This is much more than the other Watches’ 18 hours. Like the Series 9 the Ultra offers Fast charge, which should speed up charging via USB-C. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That 36-hour figure for the Ultra can be even higher though if you use the Low Power Mode you should be able to get up to 72 hours, according to Apple. This same Low Power Mode brings the Watch 9 battery life to 36 hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s battery life measured in typical use, but athletes and other users might not be quite so typical. Apple says that there’ll be enough battery power to get users through a triathlon (that’s a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and a marathon of 26.2 miles). The problem for other Apple Watch users is that the battery would probably run down if you were tracking such extensive exercise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668468/best-apple-watch-chargers-stands-docks.html\">best Apple Watch chargers and docks</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which Apple Watch to buy </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see from the above, it’s not a simple case of being able to say a particular Apple Watch is the winner. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 clearly has the best features, but it’s big, perhaps too big, and it has a big price attached to it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch 9 offers some enticing new features compared to the Apple Watch 8, such as Double Tap and always-on Siri. Although Double Tap won’t be available until later in 2023, and it is possible to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2067053/how-to-double-tap-gesture-old-apple-watch.html\">get something like Double Tap on older Apple Watches.</a> The S9 chip is a long way ahead of the S8 though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch SE is Apple’s cheapest Apple Watch, starting at $249/£219, which will be a big point in its favor, but it’s not the cheapest Apple Watch ever sold. Apple used to sell the Apple Watch Series 3 for just $199/£179 for the 38mm version. The 2022 SE is cheaper than the 2020 generation though, which started at $279/£269. Along with a lower price, the SE also offers features such as Car Crash detection, but it lacks some of the health-related features that people are looking for. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the health-related features that will probably stand out as the main differentiator between the SE and the Series 9, and this hasn’t changed from the previous generation. If the ability to check blood oxygen, take an ECG, and temperature monitoring, are important to you then it has to be the Series 9. If those aren’t something that you think you need then the SE will be quite sufficient. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you are off up a mountain, diving in the ocean, or heading out for a marathon, then the Ultra is the way to go. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Older Apple Watches </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These Apple Watches were still being sold by Apple prior to September 2023. They have now been discontinued but you will possibly be able to buy a refurbished model from <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-671574-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/watch\">Apple’s Refurbished Store</a>, or from one of the resellers below. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Watch Ultra </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The original Apple Watch Ultra was sold for $799/£849 when Apple launched it in 2022. The new model has a lower price outside the U.S. so do be aware that if the price isn’t lower than the new model it’s not a good deal!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the ultimate Apple Watch, but is it the watch for you? Apple designed it for athletes and adventures, so if that isn’t you maybe it would be overkill, or maybe you need the new features that the other Watches don’t offer, such as the better GPS and the larger screen.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tNew\n\t\t\tRefurbished\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Retailer</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/best-buy-logo.png\" alt=\"Best Buy\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$799.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6339702&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6339702%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-671574-4-1062019-9934\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/target-logo.png\" alt=\"Target\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$799</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-ultra-gps-cellular-titanium-case-with-ocean-band%2F-%2FA-87580603%3F&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-671574-4-1062019-9934\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Product</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Apple Watch (Ultra) September 2022 – Cellular – 49 – Titanium Titanium – Alpine loop Green</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$699.00\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=36395632359&amp;a=531979&amp;m=18275&amp;clickref=1-1-671574-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n\n<h3>Apple Watch Series 8 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 9 is the successor to the Apple Watch Series 8.
