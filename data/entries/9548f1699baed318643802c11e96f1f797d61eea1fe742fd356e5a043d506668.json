As happened in the U.S., demos will likely shift to an appointment basis starting on the following Monday.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven that the Vision Pro costs thousands of dollars, the 30-minute demo provides customers with a free way to experience spatial computing without having to spend a fortune. During the demo, customers will learn how to navigate the visionOS operating system, and explore built-in apps such as Apple TV, Photos, and Safari.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVision Pro will be available to pre-order in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the U.K. starting Friday, June 28 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time. The spatial computer is also launching in China, Japan, and Singapore, with pre-orders starting on Thursday, June 13, at 6 p.m. Pacific Time in those countries, ahead of a June 28 launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nvisionOS 1.2 adds support for languages in these additional countries and regions, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-announces-visionos-2/\">visionOS 2 with a range of new features</a> will be available later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVision Pro first launched in the U.S. in early February.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/vision-pro-demos-internationally/\">Vision Pro Demos at Apple Stores in UK, Canada, and More Begin July 12</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vision-pro-demos-at-apple-stores-in-uk-canada-and-more-begin-july-12.2429010/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9548f1699baed318643802c11e96f1f797d61eea1fe742fd356e5a043d506668","category":"Apple"}
