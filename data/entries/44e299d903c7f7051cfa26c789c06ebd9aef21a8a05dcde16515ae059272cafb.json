The outer appearance will still use a metal casing but will be made of \"different materials\" and the cost of the mechanical components will be lower, claims the report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe launch timeframe for the alleged new MacBook series appears to be based on a lack of related activity at major Apple suppliers like Quanta Computer and Foxconn, making a launch in the first half of next year unlikely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOver 13.9 million Chromebooks were shipped in 2019, increasing to over 30.4 million in 2020 and 33.5 million in 2021, according to <em>DigiTimes</em> Research, highlighting the popularity of Google's low-cost laptops in the education sector, especially during and around the global pandemic. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nChromebook shipments are said to have slowed since the end of lockdowns, but the scale of shipments is still larger than before COVID. The number of educational institutions that have adopted Chromebooks over the last few years is also said to have seen rapid growth, especially when compared to Apple's iPads, sales of which have lagged in the education market.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is the first rumor we have heard that Apple is actively developing a new MacBook series that the company will price below its more premium MacBook offerings, so expectations should remain guarded until we receive corroboration from other sources.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/apple-low-cost-macbook-rival-chromebook/\">Apple to Launch 'Low-Cost' MacBook Series Next Year to Rival Chromebooks</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook-series-next-year-to-rival-chromebooks.2400485/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"44e299d903c7f7051cfa26c789c06ebd9aef21a8a05dcde16515ae059272cafb","category":"Apple"}
