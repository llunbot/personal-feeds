This was, of course, the Macintosh\n(introduced in January 1984), which was unlike any previous\ncomputer. Drexel’s commitment to the Mac was also of great benefit\nto Apple, helping to legitimize this brand-new platform, which\nhelped make the Mac a successful product that continues to thrive\nin education 40 years later.</p>\n\n<p>This entire initiative, called the Drexel Microcomputer Project,\nwas captured in a 1-hour documentary filmed by David Jones, Dean\nof the Pennoni Honors College from 2008 to 2014. The film\npremiered at Drexel in 1985.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was very fortune not only to know Dave Jones (who <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/news/archive/2018/October/Sad-News-on-the-Passing-of-Former-Dean-Dave-Jones\">died in 2018</a>) but to have him as a professor for several film criticism courses (one on westerns, and another on the works of Alfred Hitchcock). I was a computer science major, not a film major, but Jones didn’t care. He was also familiar with — dare I say, a fan of — my column in <a href=\"https://www.thetriangle.org/\">The Triangle</a>, Drexel’s student newspaper. He took me to lunch my senior year and encouraged me to pursue writing as a career. He was a great teacher: thoughtful, kind, insightful, open-minded, and deeply knowledgeable.</p>\n\n<p>I saw a screening of <em>Going National</em> back in 2011, and sat on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-vCnurOBf8\">a panel discussion with Jones to talk about it</a>. It’s a good documentary, and he really captured the feel of Drexel’s campus at the time. It is a very <em>’80s</em> movie. It was gratifying that I got to tell him, then, that his advice to me back in 1996 had worked out pretty well.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/going-national-the-drexel-microcomputing-project\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5b2edbcf69c8714c72efd93bc597fcddcd408d83de56438644a1fbe7b41cb8fc","category":"Tech"}
