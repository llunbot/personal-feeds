For example, EarPods with a USB-C connector are already in mass production, according to a tweet today from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1651502314237345792\">leaker ShrimpApplePro</a>. They previously said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1630423052487098368\">Foxconn is supplying</a> the earbuds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/EarPods-USB-C-Feature-Yellow.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe new EarPods would connect directly to the USB-C port on iPhone 15 models, without an adapter. Apple's wired earbuds are currently available <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMTN2AM/A/earpods-with-lightning-connector\">with a Lightning connector</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-with-35-mm-headphone-plug\">3.5mm headphone jack</a>, with both versions priced at $19.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarPods have become less popular since Apple released wireless AirPods in 2016, and removed the headphone jack on iPhones, but they remain a more affordable option for customers. EarPods also provide a simple plug-and-play wired listening experience, with a built-in remote and no charging or pairing necessary.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 15 lineup in September, and the new EarPods would likely launch around then. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously claimed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/15/kuo-usb-c-apple-accessories/\">other accessories</a> like AirPods charging cases, the MagSafe Battery Pack, and the Magic Keyboard/Trackpad/Mouse trio will switch to USB-C in the future as well.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earpods/\">EarPods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shrimpapplepro/\">ShrimpApplePro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/27/usb-c-earpods-rumor/\">EarPods With USB-C Said to Be in Mass Production Ahead of iPhone 15 Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/earpods-with-usb-c-said-to-be-in-mass-production-ahead-of-iphone-15-launch.2387981/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"946d9fbe67aa41d61535d06a3215a9da07bd470c705d140186143abc895fcfa3","category":"Apple"}
