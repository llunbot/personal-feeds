Rapha is putting the team-only EF Pro Cycling GORE-TEX Lightweight Rain Jacket up for sale. It’s the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-23-pro-road-bikes-of-the-2025-giro-ditalia-a-stage-16-pro-team-mega-tech-gallery/\" target=\"_blank\">same jacket you might have seen the team wearing at the start of stage 16 in Piazzola sul Brenta</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-back-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1320\" height=\"1316\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-back-.png\" alt=\"EF Education–EasyPost Rapha rain jacket back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-back-.png 1320w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-back--297x296.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-back--120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-back--768x766.png 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Images: Rapha)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed in partnership with EF Education–EasyPost and powered by Durably waterproof Black Diamond certified ePE fabric by GORE-TEX, this isn’t your typical rain cape. As you may recall, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rapha-gore-tex-shakedry-jackets-new-ultimate-for-riding-in-cold-wet-weather/\">Shakedry</a> is out, and a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rapha-pro-team-gore-tex-jacket-is-their-lightest-ever-now-more-durable-pfas-free/\">new, cleaner, and more environmentally friendly (PFAS-free) version is in</a>. It’s lighter, tougher wearing, and laser-focused on race-day performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Switchout (referring to the Albania-Italy transfer after the first three stages) colorway is sure to earn you some cred at the next rainy cafe stop – but you might be buying if they see the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-close-up-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1798\" height=\"1318\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-close-up-.png\" alt=\"EF Education–EasyPost Rapha rain jacket close up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-close-up-.png 1798w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-close-up--297x218.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-close-up--1536x1126.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-close-up--120x88.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-close-up--768x563.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Worn in the Giro, Made for the Masses</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the same jacket the EF Education–EasyPost riders wore during the soaked stages of the 2025 Giro d’Italia, when the TV coverage showed shivering breakaways and soaked roads. Still, the EF squad stayed composed and covered. That same pro-level tech is now available to the rest of us… Assuming you’re fast enough to catch it before it sells out. However, for $450, you might be able to catch it on sale, but not until next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1328\" height=\"1314\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-.png\" alt=\"EF Education–EasyPost Rapha rain jacket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-.png 1328w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket--297x294.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket--120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket--768x760.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ultra-Light, Race-Bred, Weatherproof</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At just 127g for a size medium (lighter than the previous Shakedry), the EF Rain Jacket packs complete waterproof protection in a silhouette that disappears when you don’t need it and saves your skin when you do. It’s a fabric so light and breathable that it’s become a go-to for Grand Tour pros when the forecast turns foul. No face fabric means no water saturation, no weight gain, and no steamy interior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The jacket folds up small enough to fit in a jersey pocket (if there is no team car around), and when the rain comes sideways, it deploys quickly and performs well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-side-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1320\" height=\"1318\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-side-.png\" alt=\"EF Education–EasyPost Rapha rain jacket side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-side-.png 1320w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-side--297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-side--120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-side--768x767.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dialed for Speed and Function</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t a commuter cut; it’s race fit, just like the team wears. It sits close over a jersey or skinsuit, with zero flap and minimal drag. Stretch side panels offer freedom of movement, and low-bulk elastic at the wrists and hem keeps everything sealed tight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple raised collar keeps the elements out, and reflective detailing helps you stay seen when the skies go dark.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-side-R-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1320\" height=\"1310\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-side-R-.png\" alt=\"EF Education–EasyPost Rapha rain jacket side R\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-side-R-.png 1320w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-side-R--297x295.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-side-R--120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EF-Education–EasyPost-Rapha-rain-jacket-side-R--768x762.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specs, Sizing &amp; Pricing</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sizes: XS through XL (though XS, SM, and XL are out of stock – most likely for team use)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fit: Pro Team fit — close and compressive</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 127g (medium)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Color: EF Switchout (limited edition)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price: $395 USD / £300 GBP / €350 EUR</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Available now in limited numbers at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/us/en/product/ef-mens-gore-tex-rain-jacket---switchout/CQO01XXMUL\">rapha.cc</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rapha-ef-pro-cycling-gore-tex-lightweight-rain-jacket/\">Rapha Unveils Limited Edition EF Pro Cycling GORE-TEX Rain Jacket</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"9a9e0005512fe83e3436f9081302530980d2add476c51e2105f5144003270c1a","category":"Cycling"}
