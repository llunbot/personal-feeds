{"title":"Raised by Wolves S2 teaser reminds us why we loved the series—until the S1 finale","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818067","date":1638648919000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p>The second season of HBO's new original sci-fi series, <em>Raised by Wolves</em> is coming in February. </p></div>\n<p>The first teaser for S2 of <em>Raised by Wolves</em> is here, and our feelings are mixed. On the one hand, once again, the visuals are amazing and we're thrilled that the strikingly androgynous Danish actress <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Collin\">Amanda Collin</a> is returning to star as Mother. Her extraordinary performance anchored the first season's narrative arc and spooky, other-worldly vibe, and that same moody, disquieting viibe is present in the teaser.  On the other hand, we were seriously disappointed in the S1 finale, which has shaken our confidence that S2 will rebound from that fiasco to become the genuinely original and visionary series it initially had promised to be.</p>\n<p><strong>(Major spoilers for the S1 finale below.)</strong></p>\n<p>The series was created by Aaron Guzikowski, with Ridley Scott serving as executive producer and directing the first two episodes. As I've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/review-raised-by-wolves-squanders-early-promise-with-clumsy-bizarre-finale/\">written previously</a>, the story involves two androids serving as Mother (Amanda Collin) and Father (Abubakar Salim) figures on a strange virgin planet, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-22b\">Kepler 22b</a> (an actual observed extrasolar planet), after Earth has been destroyed by the outbreak of a religious war. They are programmed to incubate, birth, and raise human children to rebuild the population and set up an atheist civilization to keep the human race from going extinct. It's a harsh, dangerous environment, even for androids, and only one of their original six children survived: Campion (Winta McGrath). </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818067#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818067&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"25f3452f5e87bda2cdd3413d72a12a1b439675827b6b5695800f8c2dfb5ed031","category":"Tech"}
