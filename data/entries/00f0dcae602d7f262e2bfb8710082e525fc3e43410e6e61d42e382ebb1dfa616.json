Apple is granted conventional legal rights to advertise in this way in the agreements it has with developers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple says that the allegation that it is \"secretly\" or \"quietly\" purchasing ads for developers without their knowledge or consent is an overt mischaracterization. On the contrary, the company says that it regularly engages in conversation with developers about the ads it places and many developers express their appreciation for this support.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple says that it is committed to providing developers with the resources they need to be successful on the ‌App Store‌. These resources include compilers, testing and debugging tools, technical support, SDKs, libraries, APIs and more, but they also include advertising both inside and outside the ‌App Store‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's advertising for developers' apps, such as via email, online ads, and social media, achieved over 70 billion impressions in 2020. The company has also featured over 130,000 apps on the ‌App Store‌ and across various Apple channels, and is currently spending to support more than 100 apps across platforms such as Google, YouTube, Snapchat, Twitter, and TikTok.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/15/apple-defends-its-ads-for-third-party-apps/\">Apple Defends Its Ads for Third-Party Apps, Says It Regularly Communicates With Developers and Has Been Running Them for Five Years</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-defends-its-ads-for-third-party-apps-says-it-regularly-communicates-with-developers-and-has-been-running-them-for-five-years.2323494/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RsjvUJL6B30:St9LXP1R4DY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RsjvUJL6B30:St9LXP1R4DY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"00f0dcae602d7f262e2bfb8710082e525fc3e43410e6e61d42e382ebb1dfa616","category":"Apple"}
