The source of the vulnerability was Log4J, a logging utility used by thousands if not millions of apps, including those used inside just about every enterprise on the planet. The <em>Minecraft</em> servers were the proverbial canary in the coal mine.</p>\n<p>In the four days since, it’s clear Log4Shell is every bit as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/minecraft-and-other-apps-face-serious-threat-from-new-code-execution-bug/\">grave a threat</a> as I claimed, with the list of cloud services affected reading like a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/the-critical-log4shell-zero-day-affects-a-whos-who-of-big-cloud-services/\">who’s who of biggest names on the Internet</a>. Threat analysts and researchers are still assessing the damage so far and the outlook over the next weeks and months. Here’s what you need to know for now.</p>\n<p><b>What’s Log4J and what makes Log4Shell such a big deal?</b> Log4J is an open-source Java-based logging tool available from Apache. It has the ability to perform network lookups using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Naming_and_Directory_Interface\">Java Naming and Directory Interface</a> to obtain services from the <a href=\"%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol\">Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</a>. The end result: Log4j will interpret a log message as a URL, go and fetch it, and even execute any executable payload it contains with the full privileges of the main program. Exploits are triggered inside text using the ${} syntax, allowing them to be included in browser user agents or other commonly-logged attributes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1820027#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1820027&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"58ca36e6094bac1fc89133d5e5c89a23bc3c92d6a6b50f11c91a7cd8a2c7b1a5","category":"Tech"}
