As we've discovered ever-increasing numbers of worlds, however, we've found many that look like nothing what we have in our Solar System: hot gas giants, super-Earths, mini-Neptunes, and more. So, it can be a relief to find something that looks like a familiar planet, since it indicates the processes that formed the Solar System may not be unusual.</p>\n<p>A new discovery definitely falls into that category, as researchers have announced finding what appears to be an extremely iron-rich planet that, at least composition-wise, is very similar to Mercury. The difference is that it's nearly on top of its star and is probably hot enough that any iron on the surface could potentially be molten.</p>\n<h2>A very short year</h2>\n<p>The new planet was found orbiting a red dwarf star named GJ 367 that's about 30 light years from Earth. Red dwarfs are small, dim stars, which makes identifying planets around them easier. A planet that orbits between a red dwarf and Earth will block out proportionally more of the star's light. And, because the star is low mass, a planet's gravity will cause it to shift further when it orbits, creating larger Doppler shifts in the light originating from the star.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817761#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817761&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c8e34a215c91544ea36e6a0f5158bb55d6892d7a7ed2f4a285fca0245cb74477","category":"Tech"}
