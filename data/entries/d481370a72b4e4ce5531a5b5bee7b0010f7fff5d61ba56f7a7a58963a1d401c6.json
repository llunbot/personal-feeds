Dickle and Fred Hoyle have argued that we are living in a universe that is perfectly fine-tuned for life. Following the anthropic principle, they claimed that the only reason fundamental physical constants have the values we measure is because we wouldn’t exist if those values were any different. There would simply have been no one to measure them.</p>\n<p>But now a team of British and Swiss astrophysicists have put that idea to test. “The short answer is no, we are not in the most likely of the universes,” said Daniele Sorini, an astrophysicist at Durham University. “And we are not in the most life-friendly universe, either.” Sorini led a study aimed at establishing how different amounts of the dark energy present in a universe would affect its ability to produce stars. Stars, he assumed, are a necessary condition for intelligent life to appear.</p>\n<p>But worry not. While our Universe may not be the best for life, the team says it’s still pretty OK-ish.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/our-universe-is-not-fine-tuned-for-life-but-its-still-kind-of-ok/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/our-universe-is-not-fine-tuned-for-life-but-its-still-kind-of-ok/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d481370a72b4e4ce5531a5b5bee7b0010f7fff5d61ba56f7a7a58963a1d401c6","category":"Tech"}
