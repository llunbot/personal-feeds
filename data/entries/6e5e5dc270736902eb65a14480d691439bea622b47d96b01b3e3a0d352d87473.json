We also have <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/630264/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-performance\">more hardware details and specs to\npore over</a>, like a 1080p, 120Hz 7.9-inch LCD screen, Joy-Con\ncontrollers with mouse-like functions, 256GB of storage, and 4K\noutput via the dock.</p>\n\n<p>Nintendo also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller\">cleared up the mysteries about the system’s “C”\nbutton</a> with details about new GameChat features and a camera\naccessory and confirmed that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso\">GameCube games are coming to\nNintendo Switch Online,</a> along with a dedicated controller.</p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, Nintendo showed off a number of new games,\nlike a Switch 2 edition of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond\"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> and the\nexclusive Switch 2 launch title <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer\"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>People are going to object to the pricing, but the world has changed (and inflated) since the original Switch debuted in 2017. What I love about all of these announcements is that they’re so focused on <em>fun</em>. Nintendo doesn’t just still have it, they’ve got it more than they ever have. Just wonderful news all around.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-details\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6e5e5dc270736902eb65a14480d691439bea622b47d96b01b3e3a0d352d87473","category":"Tech"}
