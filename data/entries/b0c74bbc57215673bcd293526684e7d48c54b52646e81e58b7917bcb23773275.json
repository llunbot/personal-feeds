The team was previously led by longtime Apple employee Bill Athas, but he unexpectedly died in late 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMillet has been at Apple for almost 20 years, and he reports to Apple chip chief Johny Srouji. <em>Bloomberg</em> says that Millet has played a key role in the transition to Apple silicon, leading several teams that work on the processors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's work on blood glucose monitoring is being overseen by the semiconductor team rather than a health team because it requires advanced sensors and chips. Apple is exploring a noninvasive monitoring technique that involves shooting a laser underneath the skin to determine the concentration of glucose in the blood.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNoninvasive blood glucose monitoring would allow diabetics to test their blood glucose levels without needing to prick the skin, plus it would likely be able to detect pre-diabetes and other blood glucose issues.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this year, Apple reached a milestone \"proof-of-concept\" stage with hardware that is about the size of an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, but Apple needs to condense the components into a size that can fit into an Apple Watch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA blood glucose monitoring function for the Apple Watch remains several years away.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/14/apple-watch-blood-glucose-team-update/\">Apple Watch Blood Glucose Team Gains New Lead</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-blood-glucose-team-gains-new-lead.2401766/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b0c74bbc57215673bcd293526684e7d48c54b52646e81e58b7917bcb23773275","category":"Apple"}
