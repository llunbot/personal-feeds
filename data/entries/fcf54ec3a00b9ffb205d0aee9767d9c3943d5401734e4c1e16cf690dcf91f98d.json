Tucker \"Cinco\" Hamilton, who spoke about a \"simulated test\" where an AI-enabled drone, tasked with identifying and destroying surface-to-air missile sites, started to perceive human \"no-go\" decisions as obstacles to achieving its primary mission. In the \"simulation,\" the AI reportedly attacked its human operator, and when trained not to harm the operator, it instead destroyed the communication tower, preventing the operator from interfering with its mission.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943964#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943964&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fcf54ec3a00b9ffb205d0aee9767d9c3943d5401734e4c1e16cf690dcf91f98d","category":"Tech"}
