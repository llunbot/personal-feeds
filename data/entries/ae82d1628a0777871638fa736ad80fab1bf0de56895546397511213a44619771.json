That's not to say having thrusters is not important, but once the vehicle reached its intended orbit, the on-board propulsion was used mainly for station keeping and small maneuvers.</p>\n<p>One of the truisms about spaceflight, in fact, has been that a vehicle isn't going anywhere after it reaches a particular orbit. That's because the energy needed to make significant changes in one's orbit around Earth is very high.</p>\n<p>In space today, the current choices of on-orbit maneuverability are not optimal. There are conventional rocket-powered thrusters that require an extraordinary amount of propellant to move around. There are ion thrusters, which are significantly more fuel-efficient, but cannot make changes quickly. And that's really about it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020625#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020625&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ae82d1628a0777871638fa736ad80fab1bf0de56895546397511213a44619771","category":"Tech"}
