Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>A new entry-level EV from General Motors hits the market this year bearing the name Equinox, but other than nomenclature, this Chevy is not at all related to the current internal-combustion compact crossover. Instead, the new Equinox EV rides on the smallest iteration of GM's Ultium platform until the Bolt reboots with a new (lithium iron phosphate) Ultium battery pack.</p>\n<p>The Equinox EV shares itsÂ chassis with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/this-is-cadillacs-new-entry-level-ev-the-54000-optiq-crossover/\">the forthcoming Cadillac Optiq</a> but aims instead to hit the market as cheaply as possible and significantly undercut Tesla's Model Y. Deliveries will start later this year with the LT trim level, which has a starting MSRP of $34,995. Eager to prove what it no doubt hopes will be the new cash-cow EV's bona fides, Chevrolet invited media to Detroit to drive a fleet of Equinoxes in various trim levels.</p>\n<p>On paper, the Equinox's stats look fairly solid. A smallish 85 kWh battery is sufficient for an EPA range estimate of 319 miles (513 km) for the front-wheel-drive base model. Output for the single motor clocks in at a respectable 213 hp (159 kW) and 236 lb-ft (320 Nm) of torque. Perhaps the only downside appears to be a max DC fast-charging rate of 150 kW, though thanks to the battery's overall capacity, the Equinox should still add 77 miles (124 km) of range in about 10 minutes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027443#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027443&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"53122b590ad480e7b1f53eaa84212d7cd9fd89cca29620f81ce818c6eb3c272b","category":"Tech"}
