Characterised by their golden Kashima-coated stanchions, Fox Factory forks get the latest GRIP2 or FIT4 damper and Float EVOL air spring.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/fox-36-factory-grip2-fork-review/\">36</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/fox-38-factory-grip2-fork-review/\">38</a> and 40 also boast push-button bleeders.</p>\n<p>Fox Factory forks are most commonly seen on top-spec bikes costing upwards of approximately £4,500/$4,500.</p>\n<h3>Fox Performance Elite</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Performance Elite is Fox’s second-rung option.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/fox-38-performance-elite-suspension-fork-review/\">Performance Elite</a> is Fox’s next-best offering, boasting the same GRIP2/FIT4 damper and Float EVOL air spring as the flagship series.</p>\n<p>They also share the same chassis, apart from the gold Kashima coating, which is replaced by black anodised stanchions.</p>\n<h3>Fox Performance</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Performance line is the entry point to Fox’s range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Performance tier is Fox’s entry-level aftermarket offering, sharing the same chassis and air spring as the more premium options, but relying on a less sophisticated GRIP damper.</p>\n<p>The stanchions are black anodised and the push-button bleeders have to be purchased separately and retrofitted (only available on 36, 38 and 40 models).</p>\n<h3>Fox Rhythm</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We still find Fox’s Rhythm forks to be smooth operators.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Fox Rhythm forks are only found on complete bikes and cannot be bought aftermarket.</p>\n<p>Designed to be budget-friendly, these forks use a less adjustable FIT damper and have a heavier chassis that is cast from a more affordable grade of aluminium.</p>\n<h3>Fox Step-Cast</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Step-Cast forks are a common sight on the XC racecourse.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Available as part of the 32 and 34 series, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-fox-34-fork/\">Fox’s Step-Cast forks</a> are all about saving weight. Narrower than their standard counterparts and with a stepped design that allows for a hollow lower section, these forks are for riders and racers looking to shed every last gram.</p>\n<p>They’re commonly specced on cross-country bikes and some lighter downcountry bikes.</p>\n<h3>Fox ebike</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This 38 only gets a few internal upgrades.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Fox also offers the 34, 36 and 38 in a special <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">ebike</a>-ready configuration. These forks look identical to their non-electric bike counterparts, however, there are some differences under the hood.</p>\n<p>Fox’s E-Optimized forks get a custom damper tune and progressive air spring, maximising traction for the heavier system weight.</p>\n<p>The 34 and 36 also get beefed-up CSU (crown, steerer and upper tube) assemblies to boost their stiffness and strength. The E-Tuned 38 only gets the internal upgrades, because Fox claims it’s already stiff enough in its standard guise.</p>\n<h2>Fox suspension fork models explained</h2>\n<p>Fox’s suspension fork line-up consists of five main models, named after their stanchion diameter, covering all ranges of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">suspension travel</a> from cross-country to enduro and downhill.</p>\n<h3>Fox 32</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Fox 32 is a budget-oriented cross-country fork.

The flagship Factory option gets a FIT4 damper, while the entry-level Performance model uses a simpler GRIP damper.</p>\n<h3>Fox 34</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 34 steps the travel up to 130/140mm.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robyn Furtado / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Intended use:</strong> Trail</li>\n<li><strong>Travel:</strong> 130 or 140mm</li>\n<li><strong>Damper:</strong> GRIP2, FIT4, GRIP</li>\n<li><strong>Wheel sizes:</strong> 29in</li>\n</ul><p>The Fox 34 is a versatile <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">trail riding</a> fork, designed to be light and tuneable with enough stiffness and support to tackle anything your local trail centre could throw at it.</p>\n<p>The fork offers 130 or 140mm of travel and is available in three models – Factory, Performance Elite and Performance – which are all 29in only.</p>\n<p>The 34 Factory is available with 130 or 140mm travel and a choice of Fox’s flagship GRIP2 damper (which offers maximum adjustment) or the FIT4 damper (which has an adjustable three-position lever).</p>\n<p>The Performance Elite model is available exclusively with the FIT4 damper and 130mm travel, while the entry-level Performance option gets the basic GRIP damper and 140mm travel.</p>\n<h3>Fox 34 Step-Cast</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Step-Cast forks are light but sturdy.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Intended use:</strong> XC</li>\n<li><strong>Travel:</strong> 100 or 120mm</li>\n<li><strong>Damper:</strong> FIT4, GRIP</li>\n<li><strong>Wheel sizes:</strong> 29in</li>\n</ul><p>The 34 Step-Cast is made for the modern breed of burly XC racecourses.

These pressure-release valves enable you to easily expel pressure built up in the fork lowers. The pressure build-up can be caused by rapid changes in temperature or altitude and negatively affect suspension performance.</p>\n<h3>Kabolt axle</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Kabolt needs a 6mm hex wrench for installation and removal.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oli Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Kabolt axle is an optional replacement for Fox’s standard flip-lever axle.
