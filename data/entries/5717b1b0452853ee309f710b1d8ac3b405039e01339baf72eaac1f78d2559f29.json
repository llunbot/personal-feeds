{"title":"Hyperspace 1.1","link":"https://hypercritical.co/hyperspace/","date":1742339021000,"content":"\n<p>New (well, newish) Mac app from John Siracusa:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hyperspace-reclaim-disk-space/id6739505345?mt=12\">Hyperspace</a> searches for files with identical contents within\none or more folders. If it finds any, it can then reclaim the disk\nspace taken by all but one of the identical files — <em>without\nremoving any of the files!</em></p>\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/hyperspace/#how-it-works\">learn more</a> about how this is done, if you’re\ninterested, but the short version is that Hyperspace uses a\nstandard feature of the macOS file system: space-saving clones.\nThe Finder does the same thing when you duplicate a file.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I love everything about this app. I love the name — it “works” in like at least three ways. I love that it’s right up Siracusa’s alley. I love that Siracusa has talked about it, at wonderful length, on ATP and <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/2025/02/25/hyperspace\">expounded upon it on his blog</a>. I love that the premise sounds a little crazy but the explanation makes all the sense in the world. I love that this small, laser-focused utility is fully and splendidly documented. I love the way it looks. It’s got a great icon. I mean <em>of course</em> it would, but still, let’s celebrate how fun this is.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/18/hyperspace\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5717b1b0452853ee309f710b1d8ac3b405039e01339baf72eaac1f78d2559f29","category":"Tech"}
