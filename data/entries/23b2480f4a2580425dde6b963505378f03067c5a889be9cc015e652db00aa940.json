It carries all forms of assumptions from across South Africa, and afar. For most, it is a dry and arid place, extremely hot in summer, and abandoned by most trees for its harsh climate. Drought comes and goes in the folklore of seven-year cycles, leaving the landscape sad and sedentary right before the rain arrives to relieve the earth of such a weight, kickstarting the scrublands back into life.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1634\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-41.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-41.jpg?w=1634&amp;quality=75 1634w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-41.jpg?resize=1024,835&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-41.jpg?resize=768,627&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-41.jpg?resize=1335,1089&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-41.jpg?resize=700,571&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-41.jpg?resize=1536,1253&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The towns scattered across the Great Karoo bring both fascination and a challenging history, spanning centuries of mostly Afrikaans, English, and originally indigenous African communities.

Traditional farming still dominates the landscape, however more and more people seek solitude and isolation in these bucolic locales, retreating from the normality and convenience of big city life. Out here there is a quiet clash between strong communal ties and those that prefer to be left alone. Similarly, this rich and layered paradox speaks to many sportspeople; men and women hurtling towards the unknown, both together and alone.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1634\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-12.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-12.jpg?w=1634&amp;quality=75 1634w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-12.jpg?resize=1024,835&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-12.jpg?resize=768,627&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-12.jpg?resize=1335,1089&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-12.jpg?resize=700,571&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-12.jpg?resize=1536,1253&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Many cycling races have become too generic, often forgetting about their unique locations, personalities, and communities. The charm of vintage racing hangs on by a thread. And, while technology has allowed for exponential growth in the sport, there is a balance to be sought between yesteryear and today, between the historic small towns and their communities, the racers drawn to the challenge of endurance sport on modern-day gravel bikes, and the ancient landscapes that predate them all.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-44.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-44.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-44.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-44.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-44.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-44.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-44.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-44.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>When Julian Robinet reached out about documenting a race across the Karoo, and trying to capture the visual narrative that is so naturally presented out in that wild place, immediately I was all in.

Katy, his wife and partner in the event, made all the decor by hand, paying careful attention to the choice of colors, textures, and designs.

A small and considered bunch of cycling folk converged upon Somerset Street in Graaf Reinet, ready to wrestle with the long road ahead by traversing the 179-kilometer gravel course through the African Karoo. The weather was very out of character: rain and cold meant that everybody involved had to adjust their strategy for the day ahead.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-69.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-69.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-69.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-69.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-69.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-69.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-69.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-69.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The roads were all dirt except for a few mandatory miles of tar and, for the most part, were rather unwrinkled. However the route carried all the pickings of a fine adventure; technical descents that shook the handlebars wildly, even cracking a couple rims, and sending one gentleman to the ground and out of the race. River crossings en masse forced riders to dismount and stride through the muddy water, bicycles afloat on tired arms.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-59.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-59.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-59.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-59.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-59.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-59.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-59.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-59.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>This is the Road to Desolation, a physical and mental challenge that ends in a summit finish after traveling through unforgettable landscapes, remote vistas, and a variety of seldom-frequented back roads. The town of Graaf Reinet, home to the race, sits at roughly 750 masl (2,460 ft). Riders would ascend a total of 2,773 m across the day before a steep and unforgiving 7 km final climb sends them to the finish atop the valley of Desolation, where ancient dolerite spires rise skyward from the ground below.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-64.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-64.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-64.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-64.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-64.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-64.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-64.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/12/RTD-64.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Rain, clouds, and mud wouldn’t stop this band of adventurers from embracing the challenging journey of the inaugural race across the Camdeboo plains of the Karoo.

It was a chance to disconnect from the busyness of city life and reconnect with nature, ourselves, and our sense of community. The weather swept across the valley from dawn to dusk and the clouds that enveloped the top of the climb never quite subsided. A fitting end to an extremely challenging journey across the Karoo, instead of the beautiful views that the riders were hoping to receive they arrived soaked and sodden, cold to the bone and somewhat shellshocked at the mix of climates and environments they had just traveled through.</p>\n<p>The curtains closed on the first completion of the event with a lavish dinner at the local Graaf Reinet club, a true Karoo establishment, featuring memorabilia and stories from generations past.
