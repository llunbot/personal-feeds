{"title":"‘The Gentlemen’ on Netflix","link":"https://www.netflix.com/title/81437051","date":1710540318000,"content":"\n<p>New series on Netflix created by Guy Ritchie (who directed the first two episodes as well). I’ve been a fan Ritchie’s zany, violent crime movies ever since 1998’s <em><a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/100-lock-stock-and-two-smoking-barrels\">Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels</a></em>, and <em>The Gentlemen</em> scratches the same itch. (Ritchie also made <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/522627-the-gentlemen\">a movie called <em>The Gentlemen</em></a> in 2020, which I think takes place in the same cinematic universe as the show.)</p>\n\n<p>I enjoyed this show so much, it took all my self-restraint not to stay up all night and binge it straight through. Funny, clever, exciting.
