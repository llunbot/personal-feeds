The camera lenses are positioned on the left side of the bar, while an LED flash, a rear microphone, and the LiDAR Scanner are lined up vertically on the right side.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProsser said the iPhone 17 Pro features a two-tone finish, with the camera bar appearing to be darker than the rest of the rear shell.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear if this alleged design change has any benefits, or if it is purely for aesthetics.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nProsser said his information is based on multiple sources familiar with the iPhone 17 Pro's design, and he said that he has seen the device himself.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe redesigned camera array would presumably extend to the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but Prosser did not confirm that. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/alleged-iphone-17-air-shell/\">ultra-thin \"iPhone 17 Air\" is also rumored to feature a rear camera bar</a>, but with only a single camera. It is not clear if the camera bar will extend to the lowest-end iPhone 17 model, but it seems likely for consistency.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle's Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro also have a rear camera bar, but the lenses are arranged in a horizontal line rather than triangularly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProsser has been a well-known tech YouTuber for more than a decade. Like most sources, he has a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">mixed track record</a> with Apple rumors, with  some hits and some misses. In 2020, he was the first source to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/14/prosser-airtags-design-likely-announced-tomorrow/\">reveal the design of the AirTag</a>, many months before it was announced. He also shared <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/\">many accurate details about the iPad mini 6</a>, months before that device was announced. On the other hand, he and others were wrong about the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/prosser-apple-watch-series-7-design/\">Apple Watch Series 7 having flat edges</a>, although perhaps Apple tested such a design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProsser recently claimed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/\">iOS 19 will introduce a redesigned Camera app</a> with a visionOS-like design, including translucent menus and buttons.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 series in September, and additional design-related rumors will likely surface before then.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/iphone-17-pro-camera-design-leak/\">iPhone 17 Pro With All-New Camera Bar Design Allegedly Revealed</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-with-all-new-camera-bar-design-allegedly-revealed.2449343/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"578e4fc66c8fb638708ee90af5593e23e32537d38c34aab0d8d6b9fdb2026c18","category":"Apple"}
