It also had limitations in following complex prompts with multiple elements, sometimes missing key details or misinterpreting instructions. These shortcomings left room for improvement that OpenAI would address in subsequent iterations, such as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/\">DALL-E 3</a> in 2023.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/\">announced</a> new multimodal image generation capabilities that are directly integrated into its GPT-4o AI language model, making it the default image generator within the ChatGPT interface. The integration, called \"4o Image Generation\" (which we'll call \"4o IG\" for short), allows the model to follow prompts more accurately (with better text rendering than DALL-E 3) and respond to chat context for image modification instructions.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/openais-new-ai-image-generator-is-potent-and-bound-to-provoke/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/openais-new-ai-image-generator-is-potent-and-bound-to-provoke/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bea25540a036b7bcad5d092d2030a9d4a17dcd0a459f9ffe3cd4daefe0028dcc","category":"Tech"}
