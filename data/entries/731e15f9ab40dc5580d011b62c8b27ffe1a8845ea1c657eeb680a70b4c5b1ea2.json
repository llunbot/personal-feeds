It has essentially become my truck, my work vehicle, both figuratively and literally. Since becoming the E.D. of a bike and transportation focused nonprofit, I’ve found myself, weirdly, driving more than I did when I was a local bike shop grease monkey.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Being a one person staff means hauling a lot of items solo, whether it’s a table of swag and resources as a vendor or running a fully mobile free bike repair pop up workshop. This cargo bike, my first cargo bike and my first e-bike, helps me do more of that kind of work by bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-6.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-6.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-9.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-9.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>One of our recent acquisitions is a pull-behind-bike bike lane sweeper, which we’ve named Wheelie Clean. The sweeper is a custom built, homemade gadget from <a href=\"http://bikelanesweeper.com\">bikelanesweeper.com</a>. Ours is the “hybrid” model. It picks up debris and sweeps it to the side. It looks pretty fantastic when attached to my cargo bike, so I thought I’d take a few photos to share.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-8.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-8.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-7.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-7.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>For Bike Month this year, we gathered some volunteers, grabbed some shovels and brooms, and took Wheelie Clean for its inaugural run on a downtown bike lane that’s often littered with trash, debris, sand, and gravel. This particular lane is problematic because it sits on an overbuilt, three lane wide road that’s as straight as an arrow, which encourages cars to drive too fast.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-11.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Having to veer out of the narrow painted bike lane to avoid debris creates an unsafe experience for all who use the lane. Now, it is, at least for the time being, clean.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Wheelie-Clean-Omnium-e-Cargo-Bike-Lane-Sweeper-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>You can check out a short video Reel on our <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/oaksandspokes/\">Instagram</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/scaHO9aBbHM\">YouTube</a> to see it in action.</p>\n<p>In the photo, I’m pulling the sweeper while hauling 10 traffic cones, trash bags, 3 trash grabbers, a push broom, a snow shovel, several safety vests, and a leaf blower.
