The adhesive looks like a curved strip with\nwhat appears to be a thin film of aluminum embedded into it. It’s\napplied much like any other adhesive strip: peel away the film,\nand press it between whatever two things it needs to stick. But to\nrelease it, that’s where the magic happens. One applies a voltage\n(a 9V battery will do the job) between the aluminum frame of the\nphone and a special tab on the battery. In about a minute the\nbattery will come away with no force, and residue-free.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clever.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/24/iphones-16-electrically-released-adhesive\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9481cb9560afd090ecaabb8a33228ff40fb6f270302d5a5ccc1314e1d066a091","category":"Tech"}
