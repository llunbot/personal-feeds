Assuming the packaging isn't region specific, Apple appears to have done away with the little booklet containing SIM card and other basic instructions. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlso, like the iPad Pro and iPad Air models that were unveiled earlier this year, there are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/no-apple-stickers-with-new-ipads/\">no Apple stickers included in the box</a>. All you get is the iPhone 16 and a braided USB-C cable. It's not too surprising – Apple previously announced that it aimed to achieve plastic-free packaging by 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 16 Pro models have several new features, including larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays with thinner bezels, longer battery life, a new Camera Control button for quick access to camera functions, a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, a faster A18 Pro chip, Wi-Fi 7 support, faster 5G, faster charging, and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>iPhone 16 Pro Unboxing <a href=\"https://t.co/oiUtk5F928\">pic.twitter.com/oiUtk5F928</a></p>— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1835779968804024775?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 16, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nPre-orders for iPhone 16 models began at the end of last week, and shipping estimates for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max on Apple's online store in the U.S. have since slipped into October for many configurations.
