Asking nicely rarely works, so Google <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/introducing-new-play-store-for-large-screens.html\">is changing</a> the Play Store ranking algorithms to increase the visibility of apps that better support large screens.</p>\n<p>Google's blog post says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Apps and games that adhere to our <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screen-app-quality\" target=\"_blank\">large screen app quality guidelines</a> will now be ranked higher in search and Apps and Games Home. This helps users find apps that resize well, aren't letterboxed, and support both portrait and landscape orientations.
