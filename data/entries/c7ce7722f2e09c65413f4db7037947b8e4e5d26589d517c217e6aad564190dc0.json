So far, the FDA has treated these tweaked vaccines the same way it treats seasonal flu shots, which have long been updated annually to match currently circulating strains of flu viruses.</p>\n<p>The FDA does not consider seasonal flu shots brand-new vaccines. Rather, they're just slightly altered versions of the approved vaccines. As such, the regulator does not require companies to conduct lengthy, expensive vaccine trials to prove that each slightly changed version is safe and effective. If they did, generating annual vaccines would be virtually impossible. <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/its-good-time-get-your-flu-vaccine\">Each year, from late February to early March</a>, the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization direct flu shot makers on what tweaks they should make to shots for the upcoming flu season. That gives manufacturers just enough time to develop tweaks and start manufacturing massive supplies of doses in time for the start of the flu season.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/under-trump-the-fda-may-no-longer-approve-seasonal-covid-shots/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/under-trump-the-fda-may-no-longer-approve-seasonal-covid-shots/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c7ce7722f2e09c65413f4db7037947b8e4e5d26589d517c217e6aad564190dc0","category":"Tech"}
