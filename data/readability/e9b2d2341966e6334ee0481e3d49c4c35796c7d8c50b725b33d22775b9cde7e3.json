The Gardners kick things off with a funny video about what they’re pursuing beyond the cycling world, and the Transition crew shows us how to throw a proper company outing! The fun and games continue when things get sendy with Brendog and friends at Dyfi bike park.</p><p>On a more serious note, Ella Connely enjoys shredding without the clock in her off-season, Rab Wardell races the big clock (aging as an athlete), and Mark Beaumont brings us a 20-minute tale of his first-ever race… and it wasn’t an easy one.</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9-rwlgELU8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><h2>Tubular – A Biking Story</h2><p>As racing becomes stale for Becky and Ryan Gardner, they decide to embark upon a new sport: High Alpine Extreme Tubing. The confident pair realize they’ve got some competition and must rise to the challenge of bagging North America’s gnarliest alpine descent in short order. It looks like WTB put a lot of effort into creating this hilarious video, the Gardners are better actors than many SNL hosts, and it’s definitely worth your next nine minutes!</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/\">wtb.com</a></p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XerDleMPWro?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><h2>2021 Transition Company Trip</h2><p><strong>From Transition:</strong></p><p><em>“Here at Transition Bikes, our culture is as important as our product. Over the last two years we have grown more than all of our previous years combined, now totaling 38 employees.&nbsp;We have always been a company run by riders, so every year we shut down the HQ, and go somewhere new for a few days to hang out, enjoy some good food, and most importantly, ride our bikes!”</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.transitionbikes.com/\">transitionbikes.com</a></p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZgyCzDfaT4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><h2>Dream Trains in Dyfi – Wales – A Dog’s Life S.2 Ep.3</h2><p><strong>From Scott:</strong></p><p><em>“Desperate to clock up a few air miles on the big bike, Brendan hits the long-awaited and highly anticipated Oakley Icon Way jump line at Dyfi bike park in Wales. Labeled as a “Triple Black” by Dyfi trail building mastermind, Dan Atherton, this jump line is without a doubt one of the largest sets of jumps and drops on offer across Europe and the UK. Brendan is also joined by none other than newly inducted MTB Hall of Fame shredder, Rachel Atherton, alongside a long list of incredible local riders itching to go big for the latest installment of “A Dog’s Life”.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.scott-sports.com/us/en/sports/bike\">scott-sports.com</a></p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_uZomXS0wV8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><h2>Ella Conolly – Keep Riding</h2><p><strong>From Rapha:</strong></p><p><em>“From early spring to autumn, start gate to finish line, the world of enduro racing is intense. Around every corner, through every pedal section and down every drop, there’s reward for those prepared to push and risk for those who push too hard. In winter, however, things slow down. Nature regenerates, and so do we. It’s a time to relax, re-evaluate and rebuild. A time to switch off, before switching on again. After several seasons on the EWS circuit, Ella Conolly knows this well, and on her home trails in Scotland she’s focused on one thing: the section straight ahead of her.”</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US\">rapha.cc</a></p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i_L7AFnDbOg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><h2>Old Enough to Know Better presented by Wahoo</h2><p><strong>From Wahoo:</strong></p><p><em>“In the first episode of this four part series, Rab (Wardell) takes a look back at where it all began, in the foothills of Fife, through to the crushing disappointment of the 2006 commonwealth games, and how that has led to where he is now, including his FKT on the West Highland way in 2020. He begins to ask the question, at 36, should he know better than to risk reliving past pains, or is chasing dreams always worthwhile?”</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.wahoofitness.com/?canleave\">wahoofitness.com</a></p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sgILJKtVh58?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><h2>MAIDEN RACE – Mark Beaumont’s tale of GBDURO</h2><p><strong>From Shimano:</strong></p><p><em>“Despite a career of world-firsts in endurance cycling expeditions,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://markusstitz.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7ae25218ad4572a88158b33db&amp;id=d1af9729f3&amp;e=2152a119db\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://markusstitz.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u%3D7ae25218ad4572a88158b33db%26id%3Dd1af9729f3%26e%3D2152a119db&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1639271248327000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0scB28bWrCeWpGyGjbqdtC\">Mark Beaumont</a></em><em>, the current round-the-world record holder, had never competed in anything other than what amounts to very extreme solo time trials.
