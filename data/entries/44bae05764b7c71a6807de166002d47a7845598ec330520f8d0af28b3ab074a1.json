KnowBe4 CEO and founder Stu Sjouwerman described the incident in a <a href=\"https://blog.knowbe4.com/how-a-north-korean-fake-it-worker-tried-to-infiltrate-us\">blog post</a> yesterday, calling it a cautionary tale that was fortunately detected before causing any major problems.</p>\n<p>\"First of all: No illegal access was gained, and no data was lost, compromised, or exfiltrated on any KnowBe4 systems,\" Sjouwerman wrote. \"This is not a data breach notification, there was none. See it as an organizational learning moment I am sharing with you. If it can happen to us, it can happen to almost anyone. Don't let it happen to you.\"</p>\n<p>KnowBe4 said it was looking for a software engineer for its internal IT AI team. The firm hired a person who, it turns out, was from North Korea and was \"using a valid but stolen US-based identity\" and a photo that was \"enhanced\" by artificial intelligence. There is now an active FBI investigation amid suspicion that the worker is what KnowBe4's blog post called \"an Insider Threat/Nation State Actor.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039069#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039069&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"44bae05764b7c71a6807de166002d47a7845598ec330520f8d0af28b3ab074a1","category":"Tech"}
