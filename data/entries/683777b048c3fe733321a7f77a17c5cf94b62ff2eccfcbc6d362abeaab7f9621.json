Believe it or not, your iPhone could help with that. Keep reading to learn how.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/airpods-pro-adaptive-audio.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"447\" />\r<br />\nIf you are looking to minimize distractions when you focus on something, or just want to zone out after a hard day's work, it's well worth checking out the Background Sounds feature on your iPhone or iPad. Whether you are at home or in a public place, you can play calming sounds with just a few taps on your device to help you concentrate or rest.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn iOS and iPadOS, Apple's Background Sounds include balanced, bright, and dark noise, as well as natural sounds like ocean, rain, and stream. All of the sounds can be set to play in the background to mask unwanted environmental or external noise, and the sounds mix into or duck under other audio and system sounds, so you don't have to drown out what's important to you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Enable Background Sounds on iPhone and iPad</h2>\r<br />\n<ol><li>Launch the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iPhone or iPad.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Under \"Hearing,\" tap <strong>Audio &amp; Visual</strong>.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/1background-sounds-ios.jpg\" alt=\"accessibility\" width=\"2898\" height=\"2796\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>Tap <strong>Background Sounds</strong>, then tap the switch to turn on <strong>Background Sounds</strong> on the next screen.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Sound</strong> to choose a sound effect.

Here's how to set one up.\r<br />\n<h2>Set Up the Accessibility Shortcut</h2>\r<br />\n<ol><li>Tap through to <b>Settings ➝ Accessibility</b>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Select <b>Accessibility Shortcut</b> near the bottom of the menu.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Background Sounds</strong> to select it.
