Instead, they gained much, much more—some 200 megawatts of programmable capacity to charge or discharge to the grid at will. That’s enough energy to power roughly 40,000 homes.</p>\n<p>Castellucci, whose pronouns are they/them, acquired this remarkable control after gaining access to the administrative account for GivEnergy, the UK-based energy management provider who supplied the systems. In addition to the control over an estimated 60,000 installed systems, the admin account—which amounts to root control of the company's cloud-connected products—also made it possible for them to enumerate names, email addresses, usernames, phone numbers, and addresses of all other GivEnergy customers (something the researcher didn't actually do).</p>\n<p>“My plan is to set up<a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/\"> Home Assistant</a> and integrate it with that, but in the meantime, I decided to let it talk to the cloud,” Castellucci <a href=\"https://rya.nc/vpp-hack.html\">wrote Thursday</a>, referring to the recently installed gear. “I set up some scheduled charging, then started experimenting with the API. The next evening, I had control over a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_power_plant\"> virtual power plant</a> comprised of tens of thousands of grid connected batteries.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042026#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042026&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9246ab92fd00d9e47ee2815dd5cb0547375ba87744efe9758f383a30295f169a","category":"Tech"}
