Another year of great gear and my 2024 Editor’s Choice Awards to wrap up the best of the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year again felt like it flew by. That’s partly because I took on more and more of our Euro and mountain bike workload and partly just that there was a fresh flow of great new bikes to test. Plus, I headed out to the tech pits of more bike races this year – from our home Czech CX Worlds to new Enduro &amp; DH World Cups in Poland, to the local XC World Cup, some Gravel World Series racing, and even gravel &amp; road stages of the Tour de France. There was tons of new tech to cover across every discipline, even some really interesting new ebike development.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_literally-chasing-World-Cup-MTB-racers-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_literally-chasing-World-Cup-MTB-racers-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, Cory chasing World CUp Enduro riders to see the newest gear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_literally-chasing-World-Cup-MTB-racers-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_literally-chasing-World-Cup-MTB-racers-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_literally-chasing-World-Cup-MTB-racers-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_literally-chasing-World-Cup-MTB-racers-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_literally-chasing-World-Cup-MTB-racers-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_literally-chasing-World-Cup-MTB-racers-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><em>…chasing World Cup mountain bike riders for Spy Shots</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll admit the ever-growing price of top-end bikes is a bit disheartening to me. But at the same time, several (<em>but not all</em>) of my favorites of the year tended a lot more toward the more affordable end of the spectrum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, l’ll just dive into my Editor’s Choice round-up of the best new gear that I actually tested first-hand this year. Plus, I’ll also have a few solid Honorable Mentions for some promising new things that I simply haven’t gotten enough time to ride just yet…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>About Cory</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_this-is-Cory-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_this-is-Cory-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, Cory wonders why you are taking his picture\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_this-is-Cory-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_this-is-Cory-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_this-is-Cory-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_this-is-Cory-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_this-is-Cory-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another year, another quick refresher on who I – a bike tech nerd &amp; technical off-road rider – am, and why my picks might matter to you. For over 30 years, mountain bikes have been my go-to tool for fun with friends, fitness, racing, and just solo exploration. I’ve also been a designer &amp; maker of all things big &amp; small for even longer. I’ll ride anything with two wheels, but am really partial to getting myself and my bikes dirty. But riding, every category, means I might have the most year-end picks of our whole crew, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, if I had to think hard about it, I could probably say I managed to put every bike I rode this year onto at least a bit of dirt, even those lightest, fanciest aero road bikes. So even though I appreciate a bit of old-school retro tech, I’m really happy that we’ve got powerful disc brakes and fat tubeless tires on all types of bikes these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Riding (&amp; testing) bikes isn’t always easy</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly (<em>at least to me</em>), I’ve crashed more on mountain bikes this year than in probably the last 5 years combined. But I know exactly why. A few big mountain bike innovations that I dove head-on into testing this year have meant me pushing much harder and faster on some of the gnarliest terrain I’ve ever ridden. And sometimes I’ve ended up on the ground unexpectedly (or well, it was most often to be expected). But a step up in rideable protection this year has meant I walked away relatively unscathed from all but one of these ‘incidents’. And even that one, I rode away from, but was sore for quite a while. But what sticks with me is that bike tech progression helped me push myself further this year (<em>more or less safely</em>), and that’s something I can look back on favorably as the year ends.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_biking-is-not-always-easy-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_biking-is-not-always-easy-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, biking is hard\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_biking-is-not-always-easy-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_biking-is-not-always-easy-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_biking-is-not-always-easy-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_biking-is-not-always-easy-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_biking-is-not-always-easy-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(all photos by Cory Benson, unless otherwise noted)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Riding bikes can be hard – whether we do it for work or for fun, but I wouldn’t change a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice: Stupid Adventure Rides with Friends</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_frosty-bad-idea-ride-with-friends-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_frosty-bad-idea-ride-with-friends-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, frosty morning ride with friends\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_frosty-bad-idea-ride-with-friends-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_frosty-bad-idea-ride-with-friends-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_frosty-bad-idea-ride-with-friends-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_frosty-bad-idea-ride-with-friends-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_frosty-bad-idea-ride-with-friends-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it get any better than a best friend that convinces you and a bunch of other like-minded idiots to go ride somewhere silly on bikes, maybe on ones not well-suited for the type of terrain at hand, or in weather that is dubious at best, maybe bordering on dangerous at worst? I can’t think of anything better. And I’ve got one of those great friends. This year we didn’t ride together as much as we usually do. But we made up for the number of rides with quality &amp; action-packed adventure for his one birthday ride. We started soon after sunrise in freezing fog, climbed a huge mountain with a ludicrous hike-a-bike in the middle, and finished long after dark, hours later than we planned. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_sometimes-with-friends-you-hike-to-bike-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_sometimes-with-friends-you-hike-to-bike-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, bad ideas rides with friends, hike-a-bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_sometimes-with-friends-you-hike-to-bike-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_sometimes-with-friends-you-hike-to-bike-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_sometimes-with-friends-you-hike-to-bike-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_sometimes-with-friends-you-hike-to-bike-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_sometimes-with-friends-you-hike-to-bike-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with the no-drop pace, attrition was high, losing about 1/3 of our group along the way (don’t worry we planned a few bail-out spots where other friends would safely pick up the stragglers). But fun was had by all, no one died, and we emptied a keg in the evening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>★★★★★: 5 stars.

Leogang is probably best known among mountain bikers around the world for its World Cup DH track. But the bikepark itself has a lot more to offer. Think massive jump lines, multiple downhill tracks, a few levels of groomed park flow trail, and some killer new natural-feeling enduro lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Saalbach-riding-in-a-cloud-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Saalbach-riding-in-a-cloud-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, Leogang Saalbach mountain biking\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Saalbach-riding-in-a-cloud-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Saalbach-riding-in-a-cloud-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Saalbach-riding-in-a-cloud-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Saalbach-riding-in-a-cloud-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Saalbach-riding-in-a-cloud-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leogang-Saalback-family-bikepark-trip-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leogang-Saalback-family-bikepark-trip-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, Leogang Saalbach family bikepark trip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leogang-Saalback-family-bikepark-trip-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leogang-Saalback-family-bikepark-trip-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leogang-Saalback-family-bikepark-trip-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leogang-Saalback-family-bikepark-trip-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leogang-Saalback-family-bikepark-trip-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leogang-bikepark-love-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leogang-bikepark-love-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, The Epic Bike Park Leogang\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leogang-bikepark-love-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leogang-bikepark-love-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leogang-bikepark-love-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leogang-bikepark-love-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leogang-bikepark-love-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And with something like a dozen possible uplifts on adjacent mountains accessible with a single lift pass, there literally are all sorts of trails available for mountain bike riders of all ages and all skill levels. Within the short span of just a long weekend, I watched my wife jump into an airbag for her first time ever, descend crazy steep mud-slicked singletrack, ride long (but safely wide enough) twisting north shore-style bridges, and then flow along an alpine ridge trail above tree line with my teen &amp; pre-teen kids. Not to mention slowly riding the Speedster DH track, taking about 5x as much time to get down the hill as <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/yt-tues-carbon-dh-bike-of-world-champ-vali-hoell-with-rockshox-blackbox-dh-fork/\">Vali Höll</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>★★★★★: 5 stars.

I first rode this bike at the tail end of 2023 ahead of its release, but was so intrigued by how it felt and how its unique rear shock remote worked that I had to have one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My own personal <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ride-review-of-the-new-2024-scott-ransom-900-rc-dh-ready-carbon-enduro-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Ransom</a> build is at once over the top, with 180mm of Formula Belva travel up front and ultra-premium Trickstuff brakes, but balanced with a low-cost MicroShift drivetrain and either carbon DT or alloy Hunt all-mountain wheels. This ultra-capable freeride shredder legitimately looks like a DH bike how I’ve set it up. But I’m 100% OK with pedaling it up and down the mountain all day. And that essentially comes down to two features – a smartly designed shock with remotely controlled air volume &amp; compression damping, plus an all-new 6-bar suspension layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_Trac-Loc-suspension-remote.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_Trac-Loc-suspension-remote.jpg\" alt=\"Ride Review of 2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC DH-ready carbon enduro bike, Trac-Loc suspension remote\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_Trac-Loc-suspension-remote.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_Trac-Loc-suspension-remote-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_Trac-Loc-suspension-remote-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_Trac-Loc-suspension-remote-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_Trac-Loc-suspension-remote-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_Trac-Loc-suspension-remote-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_Trac-Loc-suspension-remote-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That new suspension design and slack but not-too-long geometry certainly does the trick.

Then, in the second Ramp Control position on the remote lever, a portion of the air can is simply cut off, effectively reducing total air volume and giving the same effect as having added several volume spaces to the shock. The final Climb position where you would expect to find a lockout is actually the Trail mode you might find on a traditional XC 3-position lockout. There, suspension travel is reduced to 140mm and compression damping ramps up, so you get a firmer ride with a more stable platform and more efficient pedaling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Czech-Enduro-Series-training.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Czech-Enduro-Series-training.jpg\" alt=\"Trickstuff Maxima Black MTB brakes First Look, now actually available, Czech Enduro Series training\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Czech-Enduro-Series-training.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Czech-Enduro-Series-training-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Czech-Enduro-Series-training-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Czech-Enduro-Series-training-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Czech-Enduro-Series-training-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Czech-Enduro-Series-training-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_Czech-Enduro-Series-training-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is a bike that transforms from fully open plushness to Descend the gnarliest tracks at high speed, then a Ramp-ed up suspension mode for hitting jump lines or smoother trail with a poppy &amp; playful feel, and lastly a still active but controlled mode to Climb back up any hill just like you were on a mid-travel trail bike.

What’s unique here is Canyon took their all-mountain bike – bordering on light enduro, and they shortened travel to differentiate it as more of a trail bike – dialed back to 140mm out back, 150 up front. Then, they added their unique KIS steering stabilizer tech, developed with Syntace. Basically, a lightweight &amp; adjustable spring inside the top tube self-centers your bars (<em>it doesn’t slow inputs so it’s not technically a steering damper</em>), gently straightening the front wheel when it’s knocked off-line by any obstacle in the trail. The self-centering force is higher at first, decreasing as you turn the bars, so it doesn’t make it harder to steer at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it truly has a big, noticeable impact on how the bike handles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Next-gen, softer KIS</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_KIS-in-the-toptube.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_KIS-in-the-toptube.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Spectral CF 140mm carbon trail mountain bike, KIS integration\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_KIS-in-the-toptube.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_KIS-in-the-toptube-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_KIS-in-the-toptube-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_KIS-in-the-toptube-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_KIS-in-the-toptube-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_KIS-in-the-toptube-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the 4th KIS-equipped bike I’ve ridden in 2 years, and the most interesting from a real all-rounder mountain biker’s perspective. It may not be 100% the perfect bike for all riders, but almost every mountain biker could certainly benefit from it. What really stands out for me is how well it unobtrusively keeps the bike stable through the rougher sections of trail at speed, and how it loves to be tossed up into the air. Point it where you want to go into steep, loose, or slick trails… and as the front wheel hits obstacles along the way and starts to bounce off track, it just automatically points itself back where it’s supposed to be. I could jump into a pile of wet roots or loose rocks, and not really worry where the front wheel was going to land. It just quietly and intuitively instills confidence in tricky trail situations, as you ride along.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Keep It Stable</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_riding-steeps.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_riding-steeps.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Spectral CF, all-new 140mm travel carbon trail all-mountain bike, riding steep ladder\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_riding-steeps.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_riding-steeps-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_riding-steeps-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_riding-steeps-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_riding-steeps-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_riding-steeps-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_riding-steeps-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, along the lines of my previous talk about some extra minor crashing… this great bike kinda got familiarly nicknamed ‘the kiss of death’ this season. That’s because it actually requires you to rethink how you ride, at least at slower speeds. I often ride our demanding boulders &amp; steeps with a trial-inspired slow techy style of riding, where I’ll stop &amp; balance for a second to readjust &amp; pick my ideal line, just before I drop into some steep chute or down a steep slab. But then sometimes as I drop in, the steering stabilizer will automatically straighten the bike out as I start to ride. More than once (with KIS set to its strongest setting), I’ve ended up off my desired line as the bike overcorrected – even once into a tree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounds like a big downside, but really I suspect most mountain bikers won’t ride quite like I do. And even then, I’ve adapted my drop-in technique to account for it by now. The trick is if you have several trail bikes (or swap between test bikes as much as I do). The KIS system rewards rider who takes the time to rethink how they handle the bike to max out benefits from the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My full takeaway is that only people with a garage full of bikes should steer clear. Everyone else could really benefit from some KIS-assisted riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>A great all-mountain bike, made better by KIS</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Plesivec-on-Canyon-Spectral-KIS-of-death.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Plesivec-on-Canyon-Spectral-KIS-of-death.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Albert Radial enduro all-mountain bike tires review\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Plesivec-on-Canyon-Spectral-KIS-of-death.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Plesivec-on-Canyon-Spectral-KIS-of-death-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Plesivec-on-Canyon-Spectral-KIS-of-death-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Plesivec-on-Canyon-Spectral-KIS-of-death-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Plesivec-on-Canyon-Spectral-KIS-of-death-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Plesivec-on-Canyon-Spectral-KIS-of-death-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-Trail-mountain-bike-tires_Plesivec-on-Canyon-Spectral-KIS-of-death-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spectral itself is already a great bike. Long, slack &amp; stable enduro-ready geometry in a mid-travel 29er trail package, with internal frame storage and easy flip-chip swaps to a Mullet setup if you prefer a more playful ride.

But I really love what CDuro is doing with its unique carbon construction.

And it results in a raw, sinew-like aesthetic that will surely be polarizing.

To be honest, a lot of legacy Italian bike brands don’t really make their carbon bikes in Italy anymore, so when I saw a low-cost Basso made in Italy at such an affordable price, I was a bit shocked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But its secret seems to be build simplicity, volume, and a mid-level carbon layup. There’s only one build – a no-nonsense mechanical 105 2x build with quite heavy alloy wheels, that make a great entry-level. Plus, there are still 7 stock frame sizes and simple black or white paint. My large 56cm test bike weighed 9.25kg out of the box without pedals, so it’s no featherweight. But I easily shed more than half a kilo swapping to some carbon wheels and even fast gravel tires that I already had in on test.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Basso-Venta-R-affordable-Italian-integrated-aero-carbon-all-road-bike-Review_climbing.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Basso-Venta-R-affordable-Italian-integrated-aero-carbon-all-road-bike-Review_climbing.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Basso Venta R affordable Italian integrated aero carbon all-road bike Review, roads up close\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Basso-Venta-R-affordable-Italian-integrated-aero-carbon-all-road-bike-Review_climbing.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Basso-Venta-R-affordable-Italian-integrated-aero-carbon-all-road-bike-Review_climbing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Basso-Venta-R-affordable-Italian-integrated-aero-carbon-all-road-bike-Review_climbing-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Basso-Venta-R-affordable-Italian-integrated-aero-carbon-all-road-bike-Review_climbing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Basso-Venta-R-affordable-Italian-integrated-aero-carbon-all-road-bike-Review_climbing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Basso-Venta-R-affordable-Italian-integrated-aero-carbon-all-road-bike-Review_climbing-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-Basso-Venta-R-affordable-Italian-integrated-aero-carbon-all-road-bike-Review_climbing-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What that means though, is this probably the most affordable all-road bike I’ve tested in many years.

The Ribble AllRoad Ti is the first 3D-printed, ti bike that normal cyclists might actually be able to afford. 3D-printing titanium brought the possibility to have sleek – almost carbon-like – tube shapes and next-level integration. But most swoopy, techy ti bikes these days have prices starting in the five-digit realm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ribble offers one of those super premium builds. But the bike that caught my attention is another 105 mechanical build at just $4135 / 4780€ and a claimed 9.9kg with alloy wheels. Like the Venta, 35mm tires fit and a wheel swap would make a solid upgrade down the road. But this seems like a killer entry point to a pretty great-looking titanium do-it-all road bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>eBikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A special standout in my mind this year were the eMTBs. Between seemingly minor powertrain updates and all-new drive system players, I feel like the latest crop of performance eMTBs is just so improved to make ebike naysayers reconsider how much fun an ebike could be. The latest motors are quieter, more powerful yet smoother on &amp; off power, and they are almost all more customizable these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice: Amflow PL Carbon Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_best-ebike-of-the-year-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_best-ebike-of-the-year-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, Amflow PL Carbon Pro eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_best-ebike-of-the-year-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_best-ebike-of-the-year-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_best-ebike-of-the-year-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_best-ebike-of-the-year-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_best-ebike-of-the-year-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_best-ebike-of-the-year-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_best-ebike-of-the-year-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the eMTB that might just make you rethink riding ebikes off-road. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important ebike development, in my opinion, this year was the entry of drone maker DJI into the market with their all-new Avinox motor. Who better to make an ebike drive system than a company already used to making smart electric motors that have to be powerful &amp; light enough to manage flight in variable wind conditions, have batteries to max energy output &amp; range while keeping weight to an absolute minimum, and more efficient control systems developed to get every ounce of juice out of an electric drive system without any extra weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only one ebike company so far is fitted with this compact new DJI Avinox drive system, but I suspect more will jump on in the coming years.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_new-DJI-Avinox-ebike-motor-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_new-DJI-Avinox-ebike-motor-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, Amflow PL Carbon Pro powered by DJI Avinox ebike motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_new-DJI-Avinox-ebike-motor-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_new-DJI-Avinox-ebike-motor-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_new-DJI-Avinox-ebike-motor-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_new-DJI-Avinox-ebike-motor-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_new-DJI-Avinox-ebike-motor-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_new-DJI-Avinox-ebike-motor-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_new-DJI-Avinox-ebike-motor-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/amflow-pl-first-look-all-new-all-mountain-emtb-powered-by-djis-avinox-ebike-drive/\" target=\"_blank\">Amflow PL Carbon Pro</a>. Amflow may be a complete newbie to the cycling scene, but their eMTB debut is pretty stellar. This ebike is almost as lightweight as the lightest light-assist eMTB, even with a big 800Wh battery inside. But it also puts out more torque than pretty much anything in the full-power ebike segment. I’m talking about a massive 105Nm of torque. Drop this beast into Turbo mode and flies uphill with the regulated 250W of averaged-out ‘nominal’ pedal-assisted power, peaking out momentarily at 850W in ideal situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>100W &amp; 105Nm, oh my!</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_super-Boost-mode-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_super-Boost-mode-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, Amflow eMTB super Boost DJI mode\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_super-Boost-mode-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_super-Boost-mode-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_super-Boost-mode-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_super-Boost-mode-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_super-Boost-mode-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But press the Boost button next to your dropper remote, and DJI delivers up to 1000W of boosted power at the 105Nm max torque for up to a full half a minute. It’s way more power than you need on any trail, but wow it feels like flying by the seat of your pants for a moment on a short steep gravel or paved road ramp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that might sound like too much power. But what really convinced me of the virtues of the Amflow PL Carbon Pro was the Auto mode of the DJI Avinox system. Sure, you can spend a lot of time in some super-powered modes, but then it feels more like you are being pulled up the hill instead of riding a bike. And likely you’ll burn through those 800Wh in no time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_smart-Auto-mode-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_smart-Auto-mode-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, Amflow ebike smart DJI Auto mode\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_smart-Auto-mode-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_smart-Auto-mode-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_smart-Auto-mode-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_smart-Auto-mode-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_smart-Auto-mode-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_smart-Auto-mode-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_smart-Auto-mode-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But pop this thing into Auto mode, and DJI makes sure you get the max range out of your battery, but you still have the max torque and max power available at your fingertips. Riding felt more natural and smooth in Auto mode, yet still, when you ramped up input into the pedals, the motor kicked it up a notch, seemingly just as strong as in Turbo mode, but with battery range longer than Trail mode. Outside of trying to run the battery down as fast as possible burning laps back up gravel forest roads, I think I would never take this thing out of Auto mode except to drop down to Eco for even longer range or to ride slower technical descents with less motor feedback. Anyway, the Boost button is always there if, for some unearthly reason, you feel like you need more power, say to catch up with a friend (or drop them like a bad habit!)</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Smarter, full-power ebike drive</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_riding-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_riding-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, riding Amflow PL Carbon Pro eMTB powered by DJI\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_riding-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_riding-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_riding-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_riding-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_riding-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_riding-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Amflow-PL-Carbon-Pro-eMTB_riding-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, there’s also tons of mode customization in the DJI app that lets the end user tweak how natural or how torquey you prefer the pedal assist in each mode. It really is up to you how you want this ebike to feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only real downside is limited availability. For now, you can only pick one up in a few global markets. Sure, my 10,000€ Amflow PL Carbon Pro was on the expensive side of ebikes. But there’s also a much more reasonable 6400€ version with the same motor, battery &amp; frame… just a more reasonable suspension spec, mechanical derailleur, and alloy wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 20.8kg without pedals for my Large 1.2kg PL Carbon Pro test bike, this is truly a lightweight among ebikes, without any silly light or especially boutique components. And yet, what you get is possibly the most-powerful e-mountain-bike on the market this year, but also one of the most even-tempered!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Honorable Mention: Merida eOne-Sixty SL </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-e160-SL-8000-all-mountain-eMTB-complete-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-e160-SL-8000-all-mountain-eMTB-complete-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Merida e160 SL 8000 eMTB Review: complete lightweight carbon ebike powered by Bosch SX &amp; 400Wh battery\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-e160-SL-8000-all-mountain-eMTB-complete-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-e160-SL-8000-all-mountain-eMTB-complete-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-e160-SL-8000-all-mountain-eMTB-complete-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-e160-SL-8000-all-mountain-eMTB-complete-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-e160-SL-8000-all-mountain-eMTB-complete-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-e160-SL-8000-all-mountain-eMTB-complete-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-e160-SL-8000-all-mountain-eMTB-complete-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I give the new Merida eOne-Sixty SL just an Honorable Mention, not because I didn’t ride it at all, but because I only got a couple of days on it.

It is significantly more maneuverable than most (but not all) full-power eMTBs, and is an easy ebike to hop around on the trail with a good weight balance that never felt sluggish. And the SX motor really makes for a smooth pedal-assist feel. Never too torquey, always like you are riding on fresh legs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a great ebike for riders that prefer softer motor support. What gets me though is, if you are in one of their available markets, you can now get the much more powerful Amflow for less with money at the same weight with a lower-spec, or just a bit more money for a more premium spec.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wheels &amp; Tires</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice – MTB tires: Schwalbe Albert Radial</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-mountain-bike-tire-Review_Albert-Gravity-local-tread-deformation_m.gif\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Radial-mountain-bike-tire-Review_Albert-Gravity-local-tread-deformation_m.gif\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I could go on and on about these tires. In fact, I kinda did with the next edition of the Bikerumor podcast December Tech Round Up. That’s coming soon so keep your ears peeled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tires are literally, game-changing. The uniquely simple update to a more radial construction of these <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/schwalbe-radial-trail-and-gravity-mountain-bike-tires/\" target=\"_blank\">Alberts</a> and Schwalbe’s updated <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/schwalbe-radial-trail-and-gravity-mountain-bike-tires/\" target=\"_blank\">Magic Mary &amp; all-new Shredda</a> give the tires magic-like grip. The secret is that since the direction of the primary fibers that make up the body of the tire are shorter and angled more directly across the tire from bead-to-bead, the tread is able to deform more locally to an impact of obstacle. The result is much-improved tire deformation for much more grip at the same tire pressures. In the end, I run +2-5psi more than before and still get better grip. Sure, there’s some extra rolling resistance compromise that means these won’t be viable XC race tires.

I’m happy to see new products refined in CFD and the wind tunnel – because free watts are lovely, even if they aren’t always the most affordable. But indirect or apples-to-oranges comparisons are often not exceptionally useful. So color me surprised when I could literally see the aero performance of Parcours’ new FKT aero gravel written in dust on their sidewalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review_aero-section-sketch-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review_aero-section-sketch-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Review: Parcours FKT aero gravel bike wheels, aerodynamic sketch\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review_aero-section-sketch-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review_aero-section-sketch-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review_aero-section-sketch-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review_aero-section-sketch-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review_aero-section-sketch-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review_aero-section-sketch-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>note: Cory’s sketch of how he interprets aerodynamic gravel dust</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These wide 27mm hookless internal, mid-weight aerodynamic carbon wheels have a unique profile that is widest at 40mm in their midsection, and then taper back to the bead where they meet the tire. The general concept is that by more closely mimicking the bulb shape of a 40mm gravel tire – which is also widest in its midsection – the rims are aero both in the front where the tire cuts first into the wind and at the back of the wheel where the rim leads into the wind. Then, in the middle, the narrower section where the rim &amp; tire meet creates a dead zone where air is essentially trapped as the wheel is spinning, and air flows past the wheel smoothly with less drag.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review-on-Canyon-Grail-complete-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review-on-Canyon-Grail-complete-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Parcours FKT all-rounder affordable aero carbon gravel bike wheels Review on a Canyon Grail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review-on-Canyon-Grail-complete-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review-on-Canyon-Grail-complete-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review-on-Canyon-Grail-complete-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review-on-Canyon-Grail-complete-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Parcours-FKT-all-rounder-affordable-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-wheels-Review-on-Canyon-Grail-complete-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=parcours\" target=\"_blank\">you can see their aerodynamic performance</a> in how dust simply doesn’t ever settle on the half of the rim closest to the tire (but it does settle on the nose of the rims.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They aren’t especially flashy. But I set some personal Fastest Known Times on local segments before sending them back to Parcours. And they hit a sweet spot of visible aero performance, light-enough weight, and reasonable enough affordability that I think makes them an excellent all-rounder gravel bike upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Components &amp; Gadgets</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Editor’s Choice – Drivetrain: Campagnolo Ekar GT</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Campagnolo-Ekar-GT-affordable-13-speed-gravel-bike-groupset-on-gravel.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Campagnolo-Ekar-GT-affordable-13-speed-gravel-bike-groupset-on-gravel.jpg\" alt=\"Campagnolo Ekar GT actual weights, affordable Campy gravel group, gruppo on gravel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Campagnolo-Ekar-GT-affordable-13-speed-gravel-bike-groupset-on-gravel.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Campagnolo-Ekar-GT-affordable-13-speed-gravel-bike-groupset-on-gravel-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Campagnolo-Ekar-GT-affordable-13-speed-gravel-bike-groupset-on-gravel-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Campagnolo-Ekar-GT-affordable-13-speed-gravel-bike-groupset-on-gravel-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Campagnolo-Ekar-GT-affordable-13-speed-gravel-bike-groupset-on-gravel-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Campagnolo-Ekar-GT-affordable-13-speed-gravel-bike-groupset-on-gravel-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Campagnolo-Ekar-GT-affordable-13-speed-gravel-bike-groupset-on-gravel-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This past spring, Campagnolo followed up their 13-speed Ekar mechanical gravel bike groupset with Ekar GT, billed as a lower-cost alternative to make Ekar even more accessible.

Its shifting is perfect in 11 out of the 12 shifts, with one shift in the middle being OK. That makes this the perfect cassette for me for loaded bikepacking, while I can then use a 9-42t (467%) for everyday gravel riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only real downside vs. OG Ekar was a substantially heavier alloy crankset.

But it also has a lower axle-to-crown stack height and smoother action because of the better support &amp; force transfer you get from two thinner double-crown connections vs. the cantilever of a single oversized crown design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My production <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/formula-belva-lightweight-double-crown-enduro-mountain-bike-fork/\" target=\"_blank\">Formula Belva</a> fork weighs just 2.47kg, and is set up with 180mm of travel but the same a-c of the Fox 38 that I rode on the first Ransom I tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Ultra-plush double-crown enduro travel</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Scott-Ransom-super-all-mountain-enduro-bike-build.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Scott-Ransom-super-all-mountain-enduro-bike-build.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Ransom custom freeride mountain bike build\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Scott-Ransom-super-all-mountain-enduro-bike-build.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Scott-Ransom-super-all-mountain-enduro-bike-build-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Scott-Ransom-super-all-mountain-enduro-bike-build-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Scott-Ransom-super-all-mountain-enduro-bike-build-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Scott-Ransom-super-all-mountain-enduro-bike-build-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Scott-Ransom-super-all-mountain-enduro-bike-build-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Schwalbe-Albert-Radial-MTB-tire-Review_in-depth-analysis-of-Gravity-mountain-bike-tires_Scott-Ransom-super-all-mountain-enduro-bike-build-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The only real downside is that there’s an inherent steering angle limitation with a double crown, but realistically internal routing and steering block headsets have also shown that doesn’t really matter while riding even the most tight &amp; twisty trails. The other is looks. This fork undeniably makes my enduro Ransom look like a full-on DH bike. But I don’t really mind that at all. In fact, it makes it even more fun to turn heads riding this bike up the mountain past them. And with a lockout easily accessible on the top of the right leg (now just next to the bar) even climbing steep gravel or paved climbs feels like no energy is lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Forumla-Belva-double-crown-enduro-fork_riding-Jested-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Forumla-Belva-double-crown-enduro-fork_riding-Jested-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, Formula Belva enduro double-crown fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Forumla-Belva-double-crown-enduro-fork_riding-Jested-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Forumla-Belva-double-crown-enduro-fork_riding-Jested-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Forumla-Belva-double-crown-enduro-fork_riding-Jested-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Forumla-Belva-double-crown-enduro-fork_riding-Jested-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Forumla-Belva-double-crown-enduro-fork_riding-Jested-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, the travel is so incredibly smooth that I can plow through the roughest tracks I’ve ever ridden. Or fully send it off ever-bigger drops, fully embracing this Ransom’s desire to be a freeride bike. Yet, I can also easily increase the large volume air chamber’s pressure a bit if I feel like I want a bit more support, and more of a super trail bike feel. Then of course, with Formula’s signature CTS tuning chips, you can easily adapt the forks compression tune to an individual’s personal riding style. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who would have guessed that my favorite enduro fork would actually look like a DH fork!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Honorable Mention – Braking: Trickstuff Maxima</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_up-close.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_up-close.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_up-close.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_up-close-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_up-close-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_up-close-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_up-close-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_up-close-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_up-close-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Me only giving these an honorable mention and not a full “editor’s choice award” has nothing to do with performance.

But the lever feel is a bit unfamiliar at first. Like other brakes, the initial pull to the braking point is quick &amp; smooth, at which point the brakes have most likely already stopped you. But, from there, lever pull continues to be smooth &amp; easy. Standing next to the bike, that means you can slowly pull the lever almost all the way to the bar. But on the trail what it means is that after the brakes engage, even more power is available with a very tiny amount of additional lever pull. And you will never pull the lever to the bar before you have completely stopped. The result is that you don’t get hand fatigue or forearm pump when pulling the levers for longer periods on super steep or rough/rutted tracks. It’s pretty amazing, but requires some willingness for the mountain biker to adapt to something different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, not everyone will love them, not everyone will appreciate their different ‘feel’, and they are so expensive that they’re far out of most bikers’ budget. But… wow, they really are powerful without putting a lot of stress on your hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Editor’s Choice – Home mechanic: Fix Manufacturing 224 Torque Wrench kit</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_on-workbench.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_on-workbench.jpg\" alt=\"Fix Mfg 224 simple affordable easy-to-use home mechanic torque wrench on workbench\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_on-workbench.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_on-workbench-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_on-workbench-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_on-workbench-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_on-workbench-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_on-workbench-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fix-Mfg-224-simple-affordable-easy-to-use-home-mechanic-torque-wrench_on-workbench-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Fix Mfg)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it’s just another torque wrench.

It has easier-to-read settings that pretty much every other compact adjustable torque wrench I’ve used. You have to turn the handle until the arrow points at the correct settings. Even Nm markings on top, odd on the bottom – separating the two takes the guesswork out of whether you should be exactly below the line, splitting the line, or covering it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, there’s a broader useable range than most compact cycling torque wrenches – here 2-24Nm covers pretty much everything sensitive outside of cranks or bottom brackets (where, not that I would recommend such a thing, but… you can probably get away with tightening to ‘as tight as possible’). It comes in a nice lightweight meat box. All the bits I need and an extension are neatly tucked inside.

By completely cutting off the lower section of foam padding and removing all of the mesh fabric that covered the top &amp; side vent structure, Leatt boosted airflow substantially. Now, I can wear goggles in hot weather – especially helpful for warm weather enduro racing or dusty bikepark laps with friends in peak summer. I make a small modification by cutting a slit in the side of the foam to make room for Rx glasses underneath, and I’m good to go for extra hot weather eye protection!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Editor’s Choice – Leatt ReaFlex Chest Protector</strong> </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_Leogang-enduro-trails-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_Leogang-enduro-trails-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, Leatt protection at Leogang\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_Leogang-enduro-trails-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_Leogang-enduro-trails-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_Leogang-enduro-trails-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_Leogang-enduro-trails-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_Leogang-enduro-trails-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_Leogang-enduro-trails-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_Leogang-enduro-trails-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my biggest revelations in finding super technical trails this year was this <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=leatt\" target=\"_blank\">Leatt</a> ReaFlex Chest Protector (<em><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-leatt-airflex-review-chest-protector-and-body-armor/\" target=\"_blank\">renamed from AirFlex</a> when I got mine</em>).

And frankly, I would only wear a back protector in a lift-served bikepark or at an event that explicitly required one. I simply sweat too much and am always too hot during summer riding to even consider a full-coverage chest and/or back protector.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_rolled-up-and-ready-to-climb-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_rolled-up-and-ready-to-climb-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, Leatt soft ReaFlex protector rolled up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_rolled-up-and-ready-to-climb-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_rolled-up-and-ready-to-climb-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_rolled-up-and-ready-to-climb-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_rolled-up-and-ready-to-climb-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_rolled-up-and-ready-to-climb-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_rolled-up-and-ready-to-climb-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But this Leatt ReaFlex Chest Protector is soft and flexible with a viscoelastic (hardening on impact) protector front &amp; rear for Level 1 chest &amp; back protection. What that means is I can literally take it off, roll it up, and then strap it to the handlebar for every climb. That has meant that I take this thing on almost every local technical trail ride and bigger enduro rides and races. It gives me much more confidence when sending it off some feature that might be at the limits of me/the bike/my tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_post-crash-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_post-crash-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, Leatt ReaFlex back protector\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_post-crash-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_post-crash-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_post-crash-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_post-crash-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_post-crash-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have crashed a number of times and got up unharmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_riding-Plesivec-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_riding-Plesivec-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, Leatt back protector\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_riding-Plesivec-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_riding-Plesivec-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_riding-Plesivec-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_riding-Plesivec-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_riding-Plesivec-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_riding-Plesivec-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_Leatt-ReaFlex-chest-and-back-protector_riding-Plesivec-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The one downside is that it offers a little false confidence, as there’s only very minimal side (flank) protection. And I did once slip onto a rock just under that minimal flank pad, reminding me for several weeks later how it left my kidneys &amp; lower ribs vulnerable. For sure, when I go to the bikepark, or more technical trips with uplifts, I break out even more protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Parting thoughts</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_gravel-riding-with-friends-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_gravel-riding-with-friends-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, gravel riding with fiedns\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_gravel-riding-with-friends-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_gravel-riding-with-friends-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_gravel-riding-with-friends-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_gravel-riding-with-friends-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_gravel-riding-with-friends-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a wrap on another busy year, and a solid overview of my highlights for the best new bike gear of 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been a year packed with a lot of great off-road riding. And I already have more set up for the New Year. At the moment, there’s fresh snow on the ground outside, and I’m looking forward to some more good winter fat biking from my doorstep – with some new tech waiting to get tested. Plus, a new cargo trailer is on the way to haul everything from tools for local trail maintenance to camping gear for longer adventures with family and friends. And I set January plans to ride in one of the few EU countries I’ve yet to set foot in. Plus, the first new gravel &amp; mountain bike testing trips are already lined up for early spring. I’ve even been in discussions for a few interesting Factory Tours as well, so it’ll just be a case of figuring how to squeeze them into my busy schedule to share more interesting tech with you our devoted readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_winter-fat-bike-riding-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_winter-fat-bike-riding-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cory's Editor's Choice Awards, winter fat bike riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_winter-fat-bike-riding-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_winter-fat-bike-riding-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_winter-fat-bike-riding-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_winter-fat-bike-riding-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_winter-fat-bike-riding-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_winter-fat-bike-riding-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Editors-Choice-Cory-Benson_winter-fat-bike-riding-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Until then, I hope you all enjoy the holidays, and hopefully a much-needed break. Go ride your bikes. Even if it is cold, wet, or snowy… a day on the bike is better than any day just thinking about bikes. Or if you’ve overtrained, take a breather. We’ll all be here when you’re ready to come back. And we promise lots of interesting new bike tech to share in the New Year!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<h4><em>Methodology &amp; Clarification </em></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Each of these products was chosen exclusively by me, purely on their technical merits for the reasons I elaborated in detail above. Many more great products passed through my hands in 2024, but I had to pick what I thought stood head-and-shoulders above the rest. Under no circumstances were any of my picks paid for or influenced by their producers. Nor was any preference or favor given to any brand or advertiser. My Award selections are limited to products I’ve actually spent time riding/testing in person, Honorable Mentions a bit less so. That does mean that a brand’s willingness to invite Bikerumor to join a launch event, or to provide me with product samples certainly makes it more likely that I will have given their products full consideration, if only so I can share my true firsthand experiences.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikerumor-editors-choice-2024-cory-best-bike-and-gear-awards/\">Bikerumor Editor’s Choice 2024 – Cory’s Best Bike &amp; Gear Awards</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1109137e6b38393ba3805c3ed34c3f15d4bbe86d63bedc2cc56282ebbab8306a","category":"Cycling"}
