Be sure to check out <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-force-axs-review\">our review of the new groupset</a>, where we assess Force AXS’s ability to do just that in more detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside its standard guises, SRAM offers the new groupset in all of its typical derivations too, including Wide and XLPR. Prices start at £1,553 / $1,832 / €1,715 for SRAM Force AXS 1× and rise to £2,228 / $2,640 / €2,515 for SRAM Force AXS 2× with an integrated power meter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new parts are available to buy now and are already specced on a large number of new bikes, including the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-supersix-evo-2023\">Cannondale SuperSix Evo</a> and the <a

the brand’s performance tree, Force retains a critical position in SRAM’s range, as it aims to offer much of the same technology as its bigger sibling but at a more accessible price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Force’s last major update in 2019 aligned it in a technological sense with then newly minted Red AXS’s wireless 12-speed drivetrain, adopting the ‘eTap’ shift logic of tapping the right shift paddle for harder gear, left for easier and both together to switch chainrings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However in detail and appearance there was a distinct disparity between the tiers. Force drew criticism for its comparatively cheap appearance next to the machined aluminium and shiny silver decals of Red. Updated Force seeks to address that issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It stems from listening to our customers,’ says Dan Stefiuk, SRAM’s road product manager. ‘We recognised the need to elevate Force to be more premium in finish, so we worked with our Taiwan development partner to upgrade the machining and finishing parts of Force’s manufacturing process.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM Force AXS groupset\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-4.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Brazo de Hierro Photography for SRAM</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is Force’s new paintjob, a sparkly dark silver that SRAM dubs ‘Unicorn Grey’, paired with ‘Laser Foil’ brushed aluminium accents to pick out the branding on each component.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the derailleurs, brakes and crank arms are fundamentally the same as the last generation Force, the update is more than superficial in some areas though, if not totally new in the context of SRAM’s wider drop-bar groupset range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new groupset effectively borrows its lever design from Rival AXS and its chainring construction from Red AXS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘At this stage we decided to not make it an entire platform change, hence the degree of carry-over,’ says Anthony Medaglia, SRAM’s chief engineer for road and gravel drivetrains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The new groupset still falls within the current generation of technology. However, we felt like we were sitting on developments we could implement quickly, with minimum resources, but that could be quite impactful to performance. That’s why we did it this way. By adopting from Rival and Red, we could optimise Force in a very efficient manner.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smaller and sleeker levers</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-5-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM Force AXS groupset\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-5.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Brazo de Hierro Photography for SRAM</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Levers are the part of the groupset that the rider interacts with most, so SRAM says it was important to bring in every update it could to the new Force AXS controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, it borrowed the newer design of third-tier Rival AXS’s levers. When SRAM released the Rival AXS groupset in 2021, the removal of a few auxiliary functions then found on Force AXS and Red AXS controls allowed it to reduce the size of the rather bulky hoods found in those two groupset families.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The change was met with a universally positive reception, so SRAM has largely replicated the design in the new Force AXS levers too, though these use carbon lever blades instead of aluminium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The levers’ operation of the brakes and the brakes themselves have been carried across from the previous Force, but the lever bodies themselves have undergone some significant alterations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-8-e1677667496264-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM Force AXS groupset\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-8-e1677667496264-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-8-e1677667496264-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-8-e1677667496264-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-8-e1677667496264-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-8-e1677667496264-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-8-e1677667496264-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-8-e1677667496264-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-8-e1677667496264-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-8-e1677667496264.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Brazo de Hierro Photography for SRAM</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/sram-etap-axs-wireless-blips\">SRAM’s release of its wireless Blip</a> (remote shift buttons) has proved key in the updated hood design. Thanks to the elimination of the Blip ports found in the old lever body, SRAM could make it more compact. Up to three pairs of wireless Blips can be paired to the levers so that riders can create alternative shifting positions. The brake pad contact adjustment on top of the master cylinder has been removed too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand combined that change with a slimmer shift paddle, meaning the lever body could not only be smaller but simultaneously offer more room underneath for fingers to grip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the changes, much of the more mundane functionality is preserved in the new shifters. A small button and an LED on the inside of each shift paddle is used during setup to make indexing adjustments, and each lever uses a replaceable CR2032 coin cell that SRAM says should power it for up to two years. Their charge level can be checked via the LED or using the AXS app.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A quieter, crisper drivetrain</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"485\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-1-970x485.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM Force AXS groupset\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-1-970x485.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-1-360x180.jpg 360w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-1-750x375.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-1-1140x570.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>SRAM</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The crankset is the focal point of any groupset and SRAM says it spotted an opportunity for a distinct visual change in this area, while also altering its performance too, by incorporating a direct mount chainring design similar to Red AXS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As opposed to being separately bolted on to a spider, the chainrings are machined from a single piece of aluminium. SRAM says this makes the chainrings stiffer and lighter (a claimed 85g saving) and also improves shift quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means should the user choose a power-meter equipped option, the Quark power meter SRAM offers is integrated into the chainring structure and when the time comes to replace the rings, the meter goes in the bin too. SRAM does offer a trade-in discount of 10% when replacing worn-out rings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Power is expected at this price point,’ says Stefiuk. The power meter equipped versions of the groupset are roughly £300-£400 more expensive than the regular groupsets. ‘We think offering power in this way makes it more accessible.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand has also added a larger chainring combination too that preserves SRAM’s X-Range gearing logic and smaller 13-tooth jump between rings. It will now offer 50/37 alongside the existing options of 48/35 and 46/33.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-9-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM Force AXS groupset\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-9-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-9-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-9-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-9-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-9-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-9-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-9-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-9.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Brazo de Hierro Photography for SRAM</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been similar updates to the 1× variations of the Force AXS cranks. Chainrings are now direct-mount, to drop some weight (approx 45g) and improve stiffness, and power measurement is an option too via a spindle-based system that measures left side-only power like the meter in Rival AXS groupsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Flattop chain and front derailleur have been carried over, and the cassette options have stayed the same – 2× groupsets have 10-28, 10-30, 10-33 and 10-36 options, while 1× XLPR variations of Force AXS come in 10-36 and 10-44 ranges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cassette design has been tweaked though. SRAM has included its nickel-chrome finish, which the brand claims improves cassette wear and shift performance. It has also built in a damper in the carrier of the larger cogs to reduce running noise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear derailleur comes in two derivations. The Force AXS 36T Max option can work with both 1× and 2× drivetrains up to a 36-tooth sprocket, while the Force AXS XLPR caters from 36- to 44-tooth sprockets but is 1× only.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-2-e1677667416745-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM Force AXS groupset\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-2-e1677667416745-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-2-e1677667416745-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-2-e1677667416745-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-2-e1677667416745-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-2-e1677667416745-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-2-e1677667416745-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-2-e1677667416745-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-2-e1677667416745-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/sram-force-axs-2-e1677667416745.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>SRAM</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The have been no major hardware changes in the clip-on rechargeable batteries that power Force AXS derailleurs – although some firmware updates have apparently improved performance slightly – but SRAM has introduced a larger charging cradle that can accept up to four batteries at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As our AXS family expands, inevitably a given user is likely to have more batteries on bikes,’ says Stefiuk. ‘The new quad charger can charge batteries up to around 75% in an hour.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SRAM Force AXS specs and prices</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>2× Force AXS with power meter</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £2,228 / $2,640 / €2,515</li><li><strong>Chainring options:</strong> 50/37, 48/35, 46/33</li><li><strong>Cassette options:</strong> 10-28t, 10-30t, 10-33t, 10-36t</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>2× Force AXS Wide with power meter</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,859 / $2,201 / €2,080</li><li><strong>Chainring options:</strong> 43/30</li><li><strong>Cassette options:</strong> 10-28t, 10-30t, 10-33t, 10-36t</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>2× Force AXS</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,751 / $2,115 / €1,980</li><li><strong>Chainring options:</strong> 50/37, 48/35, 46/33</li><li><strong>Cassette options:</strong> 10-28t, 10-30t, 10-33t, 10-36t</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>1× Force AXS with power meter</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,803 / $2,142 / €2,017</li><li><strong>Chainring options:</strong> 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50</li><li><strong>Cassette options:</strong> 10-28t, 10-30t, 10-33t, 10-36t, 10-44t (XPLR)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>1× Force AXS</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,553 / $1,832 / €1,715</li><li><strong>Chainring options:</strong> 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50</li><li><strong>Cassette options:</strong> 10-28t, 10-30t, 10-33t, 10-36t, 10-44t (XPLR)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Enjoy some groupset geekery?
