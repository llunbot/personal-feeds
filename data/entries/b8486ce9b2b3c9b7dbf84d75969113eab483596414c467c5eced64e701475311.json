There you can get Apple's <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro%2F975690481\">AirPods Pro with MagSafe Charging Case</a> for just $159.00, down from $249.00. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/airpods-pro-holiday-2.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

Given that Apple just refreshed the AirPods Pro with the MagSafe Charging Case in October, this is a very good deal for the AirPods Pro.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro%2F975690481\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$90 OFF</div>AirPods Pro w/ MagSafe for $159.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe only difference between the 2021 AirPods Pro with MagSafe Charging Case and the 2019 AirPods Pro is the addition of the MagSafe Charging Case. Otherwise, the headphones are the exact same as they were when released in 2019, but given that the price cut is already so steep on the 2021 model, it's best to opt for Walmart's deal.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe're keeping track of all this season's best deals in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/black-friday/\"><strong>Black Friday 2021 Roundup</strong></a>.
