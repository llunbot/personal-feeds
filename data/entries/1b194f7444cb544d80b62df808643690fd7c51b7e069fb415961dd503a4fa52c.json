Though Valve's statement doesn't say which materials caused the delay, it's likely that the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/no-end-in-sight-for-chip-shortage-as-supply-chain-problems-pile-up/\">global chip shortage</a> is to blame.</p>\n<p>Valve says it still plans to fulfill purchases for all three Steam Deck models in the order they were received. The company has already updated the system's Steam store page to inform customers of new shipment estimates, and Ars Technica can confirm that a previous \"Q4 2021\" order is now listed as coming in \"Q1 2022.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811986#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811986&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1b194f7444cb544d80b62df808643690fd7c51b7e069fb415961dd503a4fa52c","category":"Tech"}
