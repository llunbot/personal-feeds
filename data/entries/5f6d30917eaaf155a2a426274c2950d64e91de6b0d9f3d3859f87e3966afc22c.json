Specialized has you covered with two additions to their growing line of footwear. Designed for flat pedals, Specialized wants you to fear not, and SlipNot with their custom rubber outsoles for “unmatched traction, grip, and pedal feel.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2FO Method </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo4.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo4-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Method 2FO Roost flat pedal shoe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo4-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo4-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo4-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo4-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo4-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo4.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Feeling decidedly more like a skate shoe than past 2FO models, the new Method features a canvas upper with a low-profile fit. While certainly designed to be stylish and casual, the shoe features hidden tech to keep you glued to the pedals. After spinning around in these myself, it’s clear that these shoes prioritize pedal feel more than other 2FO models. They still feature an internal heel counter for support, but the cup sole, low profile fit, and flexible sole construction gives them excellent feedback. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo3.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo3-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Method 2FO Roost flat pedal shoe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo3-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo3-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo3-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo3-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo3-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Specialized-2FO-Method-Roose-Synthetic-flat-pedal-shoes-Lear-Miller-Photo3.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Offered in sized 36-49, standard colors include Black/Gum, Birch/White Mountains, and Black, while there will be exclusive colors for Specialized.com &amp; owned retail which include Sage/Forest Green and Birch/Taupe Spray.
