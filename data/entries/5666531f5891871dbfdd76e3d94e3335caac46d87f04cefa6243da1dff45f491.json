Unlike the existing Abound, this new version is a little taller, and sports a shorter wheelbase, a better stem and stack height, and a more comfortable handlebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Stealth-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Stealth-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound SR eCargo Bike Launch Stealth\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Stealth-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Stealth-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Stealth-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Stealth-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Stealth-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Stealth-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>My office for the day…(Photos / Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Class 2 Abound SR gets Aventon’s new electronic control unit (ACU). This new ACU offers intelligent safety features, such as 4G and GPS Tracking, remote locking, and an alarm system. There are more features that I will get into below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-my-office-for-the-day-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-my-office-for-the-day-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound SR eCargo Bike Launch my office for the day\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-my-office-for-the-day-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-my-office-for-the-day-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-my-office-for-the-day-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-my-office-for-the-day-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-my-office-for-the-day-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-my-office-for-the-day-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new size of the bike makes it easier to ride and maneuver, as well as easier to park and store. Still a super capable eCargo bike, the Abound SR is great for hauling the kids to school, picking up groceries, commutes, and any all-around errands. It’s a real multitasker. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound SR eCargo Bike Launch hat\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-logo-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-logo-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound SR eCargo Bike Launch logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-logo-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-logo-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-logo-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-logo-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-logo-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-logo-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has up to a 60-mile range and a top speed of 20mph that is unlockable to 25mph in the app. The new, lower step-through frame makes mounting and dismounting easier.

So when I attended the Aventon launch of the Abound SR, I was curious about what changes they were making to what I thought was an already great eCargo bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-new-cleaner-control-panel-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-new-cleaner-control-panel-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound SR eCargo Bike Launch new cleaner control panel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-new-cleaner-control-panel-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-new-cleaner-control-panel-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-new-cleaner-control-panel-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-new-cleaner-control-panel-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-new-cleaner-control-panel-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-new-cleaner-control-panel-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I found myself impressed with the changes that were made. These weren’t changes for the sake of change. The updates on the new Abound SR improve on the already great Abound platform, like the new and improved display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was nice to see. I am a fan of most of the recent bikes that Aventon has been releasing. For instance, besides the OG Unbound eCargo offering, there’s the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aventon-ramblas-mid-drive-emtb-100nm-torque/\" target=\"_blank\">Ramblas</a>, which is a reasonably priced and fun eMTB that is full of features and great for someone curious about eMTBs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Altus-shifter-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Altus-shifter-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound SR eCargo Bike Launch Altus shifter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Altus-shifter-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Altus-shifter-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Altus-shifter-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Altus-shifter-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Altus-shifter-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Altus-shifter-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Shimano Altus drivetrain. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-rear-rack-and-mesh-guards-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-rear-rack-and-mesh-guards-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound SR eCargo Bike Launch rear rack and mesh guards\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-rear-rack-and-mesh-guards-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-rear-rack-and-mesh-guards-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-rear-rack-and-mesh-guards-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-rear-rack-and-mesh-guards-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-rear-rack-and-mesh-guards-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-rear-rack-and-mesh-guards-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The included rear rack and mesh guard.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Aventon Control Unit (ACU)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Aventon Control Unit (ACU) helps to keep you “connected and protected”.

It’s not like the older hub motors found on less popular eBike brands. Those feel either on or off, lacking any sense of finesse. However, the Aventon dual torque sensors let you feel that you are in constant control.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Blackies-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Blackies-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound SR eCargo Bike Launch Blackies\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Blackies-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Blackies-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Blackies-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Blackies-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Blackies-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Blackies-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The slightest input to the pedals gives immediate assistance. The harder your effort, the more pedal assistance the Unbound SR rewards you with. That was nice. On top of that, I found the new handlebar and stack height to be very comfortable as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Cobalt-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Cobalt-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound SR eCargo Bike Launch Cobalt\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Cobalt-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Cobalt-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Cobalt-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Cobalt-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Cobalt-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Cobalt-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Cobalt Colorway</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The original Abound has one of those long, foldable/collapsable stems. The new Abound SR eliminated that type of stem. Aventon spec’d the SR with standard spacers, stem, and riser bar while still keeping the ability for the bike to fit a wide range of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Great Lights, Mediocre Suspension</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Abound SR’s integrated front and rear lights, worked great. The rear brake light and turn signals are a great touch for a bike of this price point. Honestly, both the brake light and turn signals probably made things a bit safer on the busy PCH while riding back to the hotel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-haze-colorway-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-haze-colorway-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound SR eCargo Bike Launch haze colorway\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-haze-colorway-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-haze-colorway-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-haze-colorway-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-haze-colorway-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-haze-colorway-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-haze-colorway-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Haze Colorway</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The front suspension fork wasn’t super great, but worked OK. I’m not sure about the longevity of the fork, but after a year, the one on our OG Abound is holding up pretty nicely. It hasn’t given any issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, in Aventon’s defense, all of the suspension forks I have ridden on cargo bikes at this price point aren’t great. I’m reviewing another eCargo bike from a competitor, and it likely uses the same unnamed 50mm travel fork, but the bike costs over twice the price of the Abound SR.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Tektro-hydros-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Tektro-hydros-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound SR eCargo Bike Launch Tektro hydros\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Tektro-hydros-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Tektro-hydros-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Tektro-hydros-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Tektro-hydros-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Tektro-hydros-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-Tektro-hydros-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Tektro hydraulic brakes</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I just don’t think a suspension fork is an imperative spec for a 20″ wheeled cargo bike. I usually lock them out and ride like that. And, speaking of non-imperative specs, the suspension seatpost needs to be revisited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it came to the suspension post on the Abound SR, it was virtually unnoticeable to me and offered no real benefit to ride quality. I could’ve done without it as it was exacerbating the seatpost length issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would find a dropper post a lot more useful in the eCargo bike space. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Abound SR eCargo Bike Launch hat\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Aventon-Abound-SR-eCargo-Bike-Launch-hat-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Stealth Colorway</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>In Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think Aventon is doing good work lately and isn’t the same Aventon of 2017. They are continuing to offer quality eBikes at accessible prices. The Abound that I own and the Abound SR that I reviewed, are both great bikes with great features at a great price point. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a reasonable buy-in cost with less risk for people who are entertaining the practice of driving less and riding more. I see this as one of the biggest benefits of the eCargo bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would highly recommend the Aboud SR to anybody ready to give the eCargo bike a go. I’ve gotten a few friends on the OG Abound, and they’re happy with their purchases.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Aventon Abound SR is available for pre-order today and will ship come 11/25/24.
