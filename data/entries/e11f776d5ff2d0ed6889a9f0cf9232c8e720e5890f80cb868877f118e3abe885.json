This new model takes the Steamboat Springs titanium bike brand in two new directions all at once, with their first carbon fiber frame and their first e-bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Moots Express e-gravel bike takes everything they’ve learned from offering five differnet titanium gravel models over many years and distills it into the type of bike their customers and dealers have been asking for. I interviewed Moots president Nate Bradley if you’d like to hear the development story in his own words, check that podcast episode here for the “why” behind it. Here, we’ll focus on the tech and details…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Moots Express Carbon Frame &amp; Tech</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-2.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1410\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-2.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of moots express carbon fiber e-gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-2.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-2-297x209.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-2-800x564.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-2-120x85.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-2-768x541.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-2-1536x1083.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed to be the “ultimate adventure-ready e-bike”, the Express blends a lightweight frame with a lightweight motor to give it a claimed 100-mile range, though they say you could get more than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a full carbon fiber frame that, unlike their house-made ti frames, is made for them in Asia from a partner factory. Keep in mind that Moots has been making carbon forks for nearly two decades, and recently debuted <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/moots-routt-crd-gravel-race-bike-mod-carbon-components/\" target=\"_blank\">their own carbon handlebar and stem combo</a>, so it’s not their first rodeo.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-6-.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1478\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-6-.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of moots express carbon fiber e-gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-6-.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-6--297x219.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-6--800x591.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-6--120x89.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-6--768x568.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-6--1536x1135.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike uses that new MOD cockpit, integrating all wires and brake hoses inside the bar, stem and frame. The full integration continues with the use of Shimano’s EP801 drive system with 504Wh battery and a mix of Ultegra Di2 levers and brakes with a big 47-tooth front chainring and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-shimano-deore-xt-linkglide-is-3x-more-durable-not-backwards-compatible/\" target=\"_blank\">LinkGlide</a> 11-speed derailleur, chain, and wide range 11-50 cassette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The right hand shifter buttons change gears like normal, but the left hand buttons cycle through the assist modes, eliminating the need for a separate switch or dial.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-3.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-3.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of moots express carbon fiber e-gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-3.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-3-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-3-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This keeps it all very clean, with the usual small display sitting next to the stem and the main power button nestled into the top tube. Shift like normal, or turn on Autoshift and let the bike do it for you based on pedaling torque and cadence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It gets the new GRX carbon gravel wheels shod with Panaracer 700×50 Gravel King SK tires, a custom WTB Gravelero saddle, and Moots carbon seatpost, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Design &amp; Geometry – Why not Titanium?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-4.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1328\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-4.jpg\" alt=\"moots express carbon fiber e-gravel bike shown from rear angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-4.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-4-297x197.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-4-800x531.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-4-768x510.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-4-1536x1020.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious question is “Why not make it out of titanium?” Because they wouldn’t have been able to get the flowing shapes or low weight they wanted with metal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame has a sloping top tube, which has standover benefits and gives it a laid back appearance, but is all but a necessity thanks to the taller front end. A taller-than-normal fork makes the bike compatible with suspension forks, letting you add boing without messing up the geometry or handling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headtube is relatively tall, too. The goal is to keep the rider in a more comfortable upright riding position so you see the world ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-8.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1405\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-8.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of moots express carbon fiber e-gravel bike shimano motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-8.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-8-297x209.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-8-800x562.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-8-120x84.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-8-768x540.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-8-1536x1079.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They wanted to keep it light, and the bike has a claimed weight of just 33lbs in size medium. That’s achieved with the carbon fiber frame and fork plus high-end components, but also by using a smaller battery. Shimano offers a larger 630Wh battery, but Moots specs the 504Wh part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet they’re claiming a 100 mile range, so how do they do that? By detuning Shimano’s 85Nm EP801 motor down to 60Nm of output. It’s still Class 3, assisting up to 28mph, but it should feel more natural. And since it’s not using as much power, the battery lasts longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-5.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-5.jpg\" alt=\"moots express carbon fiber e-gravel bike shown from side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-5.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-5-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-5-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-5-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moots-express-carbon-gravel-e-bike-5-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Even with two bottle cages, there’s still plenty of room for a full-length frame bag.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Express is made for the rider that wants the authentic gravel experience along with the ability to ride faster and further. Two bottle cages and accessory cage mounts on the fork legs let you bring enough fuel to do so. Hidden fender mounts let you get out there on rainy days, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bike’s start at $9,999 and are available in S, M, L, and XL sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://moots.com/bikes/gravel/express/\">Moots.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/moots-express-carbon-e-gravel-bike/\">Moots Express is… a Carbon e-Gravel Bike?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e11f776d5ff2d0ed6889a9f0cf9232c8e720e5890f80cb868877f118e3abe885","category":"Cycling"}
