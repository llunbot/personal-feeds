Sales are everywhere throughout the industry, from every brand it seems – and well before the <em>actual</em> Black Friday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look, I get taking a stand against the outright and blatant “consumerism” that is Black Friday, by <em>not </em>shopping at the big box stores. Or not shopping at all, for that matter. I mean, I hate crowds, so I’ve always opted to not take part in the madness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, what if we take a stand by only shopping small this season? Technically, there’s already an official ‘Small Business Saturday’ on November, 25th. But you should consider shopping small for more than one day of the year – it could literally change someone’s life, or at the very least make their year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The List</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every time I make a list like this, I have to make a difficult decision on who makes the list. It’s really hard, as I have a lot of favorite lil’ companies that I frequent throughout the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for this list, I thought I’d include the shops I very rarely share with you guys…and try to keep the list limited to the “cottage industry” type shops that are owned and operated by an individual or a family.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, this isn’t all of the cool small companies out there in our wonderful industry, so if you know of any that would benefit from some of your hard-earned cash, include a link and share it with everyone in the comments.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK? Cool, here we go… click on the names of the shops to be transported to their web location.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://randijofab.com/\">Randi Jo Fabrications</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Randi-Jo-Fabrication-Randi-Jo.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"516\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Randi-Jo-Fabrication-Randi-Jo.jpeg\" alt=\"Randi Jo Fabrication Randi Jo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Randi-Jo-Fabrication-Randi-Jo.jpeg 500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Randi-Jo-Fabrication-Randi-Jo-291x300.jpeg 291w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Randi-Jo-Fabrication-Randi-Jo-116x120.jpeg 116w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Randi Jo Fabrication)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Based in Elkton, Oregon, Randi Jo Fabrications is a small family-run operation by both Randi and her husband Eric.

It started as a place to grab yourself die-cut stickers with the brand’s name in the logo-bite, vintage Campagnolo script. Best logo-bite ever.
