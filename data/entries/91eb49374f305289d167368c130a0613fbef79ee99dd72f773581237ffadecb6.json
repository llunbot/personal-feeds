If not, what a weird mistake to happen only in the release builds. But regardless, even inside Apple, I’d file this under “no big whoop”. Of course there are going to be M4-based MacBook Airs next year. The only question is when. My guess is March, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/apple-unveils-the-new-13-and-15-inch-macbook-air-with-the-powerful-m3-chip/\">just like last year</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/ClassicII_MrMac/status/1866920590344327443\">Via Mr. Macintosh</a>, it appears the leak came from IPSW builds, which contain a list of Mac models the IPSW can be used to restore.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/11/macos-15-2-m4-macbook-air-references\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"91eb49374f305289d167368c130a0613fbef79ee99dd72f773581237ffadecb6","category":"Tech"}
