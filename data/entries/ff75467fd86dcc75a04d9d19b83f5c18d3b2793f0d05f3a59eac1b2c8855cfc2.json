Apple’s smart speaker had a ton of potential when it was <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/170699/homepod-2.html\">unveiled at WWDC 2017</a>, but by the time it arrived in February 2018, it was <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230983/apple-homepod-review.html\">overpriced and underwhelming</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Apple is taking steps to right the HomePod ship. Apple has <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/apple-hires-new-homepod-software-head-as-it-takes-on-amazon-echo&amp;xcust=1-1-544935-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">reportedly re-hired</a> HomePod engineer Afrooz Family, who left the company in 2016 to co-found Syng, a high-end audio company that sells <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://syngspace.com/?irclickid=0bMwh-Q9KxyLU2iwUx0Mo37AUkBX-QQVRTJDVg0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;%3D&amp;xcust=1-1-544935-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">a $1,799 Triphonic speaker</a>. According to a Bloomberg report, Family was tapped to lead Apple’s HomePod software efforts as the company looks to get its smart speaker ambitions back on track.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>HomePod mini</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/11/apple-homepod-mini-main-100868288-orig.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://macworld.com/article/234895/homepod-mini-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod-mini&amp;subid1=1-1-544935-5-246504-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$99 at Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>There have been <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343053/a-radical-new-apple-tv-is-in-the-works-with-a-homepod-speaker-and-camera.html\">persistent rumors</a> that Apple is working on a new HomePod with a display, so Family’s hire could be related to the development of a new device. Family’s expertise is in audio, but he is no stranger to high design and high-tech innovation. The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/syng-space/id1487256121&amp;xcust=1-1-544935-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Syng Space app</a>, for example, uses an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to test speaker placement and integrates with Spotify and AirPlay 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After launching the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234895/homepod-mini-review.html\">$99 HomePod mini</a> alongside the iPhone 12 last year, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple-kills-homepod-shift-focus-mini-3802669/\">discontinued the larger HomePod</a> earlier this year. However, despite adding a few features to Home pod mini in iOS 15 and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347277/lossless-support-coming-to-homepod-but-you-wont-be-able-to-hear-the-difference.html\">promising lossless and spatial audio support</a>, it has yet to deliver a true killer feature for HomePod other than audio quality. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Family’s new position could change that with a focus on features and a close collaboration with the Siri team. Without a visual interface, HomePod is dependent on Siri for navigation and functionality, and any feature Family integrates will need to start with Siri, even if HomePod eventually gains a screen.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ff75467fd86dcc75a04d9d19b83f5c18d3b2793f0d05f3a59eac1b2c8855cfc2","category":"Apple"}
