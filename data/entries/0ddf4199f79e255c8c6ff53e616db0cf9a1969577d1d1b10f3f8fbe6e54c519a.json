{"title":"iOS 17.5 is out now with tracker detection, News updates, and lots of security fixes","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2262753/ios-17-5-release-features-beta-how-to-install.html","date":1715624713000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been over a month since the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2218208/ios-17-4-alternative-app-stores-emoji-fixes-security-updates-install.html\">release of iOS 17.4</a>, which introduced a few minor tweaks (like new emojis) for all users, but it has a massive change to app distribution for those in the European Union. In compliance with the Digital Markets Act, that version allowed alternate app stores, changed policies and terms around apps, browsers that use their own engines, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, a new iOS version is followed almost immediately by a beta of the next point release, so the month-long absence of any iOS beta was a strange occurrence. With iOS 17.5 now available, we might not get an iOS 17.6 beta for some time (if ever), as Apple prepares to release an iOS 18 developer beta at WWDC in early June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update May 13:</strong> iOS 17.5 is now available for everyone.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17.5 release notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are Apple’s official release notes for iOS 17.5:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Apple News</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Offline mode in Apple News+ gives you access to the Today feed and News+ tab, even when you don’t have an internet connection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quartiles is a new and original daily word game that is now available in Apple News+</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scoreboard in News+ Puzzles gives you access to new player data for Crossword, Mini Crossword and Quartiles, including stats and streaks</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tracking Notifications</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cross-Platform Tracking Detection delivers notifications to users if a compatible Bluetooth tracker they do not own is moving with them, regardless of what operating system the device is paired with</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some features may not be available for all regions or on all Apple devices.

They include important fixes to security problems in frameworks like AppleAVD (the audio and video decoder), FindMy, Maps, Notes, screenshots, WebKit, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about each of these, check out Apple’s page about the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214101&amp;xcust=1-1-2262753-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">security content of iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5</a>. Suffice it to say there are quite a lot of fixes to multiple apps—a lot of “surface area” as they say—so updating your iPhone and iPad as soon as possible is recommended.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17.5: How to install </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You will probably be prompted to install iOS 17.5 eventually, but that can take days or even weeks.
