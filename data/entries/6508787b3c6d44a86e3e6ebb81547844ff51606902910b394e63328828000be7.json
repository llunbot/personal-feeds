There's no release date or price point yet, but it looks like it's a working device. Xiaomi's feet are firmly on the ground, and there isn't much about the product that hasn't been done before by Google Glass or Snapchat Spectacles.</p>\n<p>The Smart Glasses look like a slightly bulky pair of prescription eyeglasses, with a 5MP camera in one corner and the display system in the other. The display system is wild—a microLED display fires into a series of lenses and then into a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide_(optics)\">waveguide</a> lens for the right eye only. Cramming a microLED into a pair of glasses apparently wasn't easy—Xiaomi says the chip measures 2.4 mm x 2.02 mm, with individual pixels sized at 4 μm. The big compromise is that the microLED system is actually monochrome: the glasses can only display green, so you'll feel right at home if you ever used a computer in the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The biggest AR glasses product on the market is Snapchat Spectacles, and those take a more advanced approach to vision, with two full-color waveguide lenses. Xiaomi is pushing the envelope with microLED, while Snapchat <a href=\"https://kguttag.com/2021/05/21/exclusive-snap-spectacles-appears-to-be-using-waveoptics-and-an-lcos-display/\">appears</a> to be using tiny DLP projectors that project into the waveguides. Snapchat was so impressed with its display supplier that it decided <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447150/snap-waveoptics-acquisition-500m-spectacles-waveguides\">to buy</a> the company—called \"WaveOptics\"—in March for $500 million.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794464#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794464&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6508787b3c6d44a86e3e6ebb81547844ff51606902910b394e63328828000be7","category":"Tech"}
