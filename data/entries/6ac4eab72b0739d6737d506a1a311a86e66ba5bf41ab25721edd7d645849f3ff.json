{"title":"iOS 17.1.2 is out now with two critical security updates","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2159452/ios-17-1-2-webkit-security-updates.html","date":1701375662000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s time to update your iPhones and iPads! Apple has just released iOS and iPadOS 17.1.2, and while it doesn’t have any new features, it fixes a couple of very important WebKit security flaws. WebKit is the browser engine used by Safari but also every other iOS and iPadOS web browser, and any app that opens a “web view” for content. So it’s perhaps the most important privacy and security vector to be concerned about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214031&amp;xcust=1-1-2159452-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple’s security page</a> lists two fixes in iOS 17.1.2 and iPadOS 17.1.2, and there are no other changes in this release. The two updates are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>WebKit</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Processing web content may disclose sensitive information. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited against versions of iOS before iOS 16.7.1.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Description:</strong> An out-of-bounds read was addressed with improved input validation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WebKit</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Processing web content may lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited against versions of iOS before iOS 16.7.1.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Description: </strong>A memory corruption vulnerability was addressed with improved locking.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild already, albeit only with iOS versions before iOS 16.7.1. Still, it’s important to grab the fixes right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>To update your iPhone or iPad, open the Settings app, select <em>General</em>, then <em>Software Update</em> and <em>Update Now</em>, and follow the prompts.</p>\n</div></div>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6ac4eab72b0739d6737d506a1a311a86e66ba5bf41ab25721edd7d645849f3ff","category":"Apple"}
