However, shock and absorption, width, and surface texture are three things to bear in mind when considering what mountain bike grips to get.</p>\n<p>You might be happy with a relatively thin and firm grip if you’re riding cross-country but you might want something with a bit more cushioning and a grippier surface if you’re heading downhill.</p>\n<p>Length of grip is another thing to consider. If you have large hands or run a wide handlebar you might appreciate longer grips, but if space on your bar is limited you might want to go for a shorter grip.</p>\n<p>Most of the grips here are lock-on grips that have clamps. These are good because they stay in place and don’t move around, as other clamps can.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, read on to find out about the best grips our expert testers have got their hands on.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>The best mountain bike grips, as rated by expert testers</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Gusset S2 (Extra Soft Compound)</strong>: £18</li>\n<li><strong>Chromag Format:</strong> £22 / $30 / AU$39 / €24</li>\n<li><strong>ODI AG-2</strong>: £30 / $35 / AU$55</li>\n<li><strong>DMR Deathgrips Flangeless:</strong> £21</li>\n<li><strong>OneUp Grips:</strong> £23 / $25 / €26</li>\n<li><strong>Renthal Push-On Ultra Tacky:</strong> £13 / $17</li>\n<li><strong>Renthal Traction UltraTacky</strong>: £25 / $33 / AU$55</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Gusset S2 (Extra Soft Compound)</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The soft compound of these grips means they absorb impacts well, but it does wear down quickly.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £18</li>\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 131mm</li>\n<li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 32mm</li>\n</ul><p>Your hands drop neatly into place on the S2s, as the Extra Soft rubber sags a little under your weight.

The ‘traction ridges’ stop your hands slipping on flat landings. Plus, the super-soft rubber compound helps damp trail chatter and vibration when things get rough.</p>\n<p>The large twin lockrings won’t be to everyone’s taste, though. They sit taller than the rest of the grip and, if you’re used to hanging your hands off the end of the bar, you may find the outer ring a little intrusive under the meaty outer edge of your palm, especially on bigger impacts.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<hr /><h2>Also consider…</h2>\n<p>The following mountain bike grips scored fewer than four out of five stars when our reviewers tested them, but they might just tick the right boxes for you.</p>\n<h3>Deity Knuckleduster</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>3.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Knuckledusters have a 32mm diameter, making them suitable for larger hands.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price: </strong>£19 / $22 / AU$40</li>\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 132mm</li>\n<li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 32mm</li>\n</ul><p>The Knuckledusters are new-school grips that combine a single lockring with an internal conical sleeve, to give a solid hold on the bar while still allowing you to use its full width.</p>\n<p>Coupled with the waffle design on the underside, the upper mushroom pattern provides decent comfort.

Flipping them puts the knurled section under your palms for even more feedback through the bar.</p>\n<p>One of our first test pairs had a lockring drop off, but the problem hasn’t recurred with our second set. These grips are slim, tapering down to 28mm, and give a lot of feedback through the bar, which won’t suit everyone. They take longer to bed-in than we’d have liked too.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Nukeproof Horizon Race</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>3.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Two lockrings make sure these grips stay in place.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £20 / $30 / AU$39</li>\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 143mm</li>\n<li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 30.5mm – 33mm (tapered)</li>\n</ul><p>There are lockrings at each end of the Horizon Race grips to hold them in place, secured with 2.5mm Allen bolts.
