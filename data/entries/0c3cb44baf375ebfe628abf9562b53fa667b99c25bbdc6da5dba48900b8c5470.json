While we’d normally have an air of suspicion over such claims, riding clipped in is one of the biggest upgrades you can make to your riding experience. Rather confusingly, all of these shoes work with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\" target=\"_blank\">clipless pedals</a>, a name that originates from the fact that such pedals meant no longer using the system of metal toe clips and leather straps to fasten the rider’s feet to the pedals.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a veritable sea of options to choose from, including different materials, closure systems and cleat compatibility, so it can be daunting to pick out the best pair for you. Fortunately, we’re here to help.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best budget cycling shoes at a glance</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Adidas The Road Cycling Shoe:</strong> <strong>RRP £140 — <a

/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We all remember our first ride being clipped in, wobbling down the street furiously reminding ourselves that we needed to unclip a foot from the pedals before coming to a stop to avoid the embarrassing topple over at a junction or traffic lights. We’ve been there. But riding clipped in makes for more efficient and comfortable riding longer term, so graduating to ‘proper’ cycling shoes is a rite of passage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also ride our bikes. A lot. So our review team, led by tech editor <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/author/sam-challis\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Challis</a> and web editor <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/author/matthew-loveridge\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Loveridge</a> know what features and technologies are worth spending a bit extra on. We’ve also included a range of options for those with wider feet or who otherwise struggle to get a good fit.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Advice for first time buyers</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cleat system</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"587\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/06082552/dmt_kr4_shoes_7_crop-970x587.jpg\" alt=\"dmt_kr4_shoes_7_crop\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a couple of things to consider when buying your first pair of road cycling shoes. The first is the type of cleats that will fit your shoes. This will be governed by the type of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\" target=\"_blank\">pedals </a>you choose but all cleats use either a two- or three-bolt system. The two-bolt system is more commonly found on gravel and mountain bike shoes and the three-bolt system is exclusively found on road platforms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some cycling shoes have both two-bolt and three-bolt hole patterns, allowing you to make the choice which to use, but with most you’re going to have to make the decision on which type of cleats you want to use when you buy your cycling shoes and stick with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stiffness</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The other aspect which differentiates cycling shoes is sole stiffness. With a relatively small area that transmits pedalling force to your pedals, a stiffer sole can improve pedalling efficiency. Lower-priced shoes often include a nylon composite sole unit. This may be reasonably stiff, but a carbon sole will usually be stiffer, as well as lighter. With expensive shoes, one of the features you’ll be paying for is a carbon sole. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll often see sole stiffness index figures bandied around. Since each brand has its own stiffness index and this may go up to an unspecified maximum number, this is not a very good comparator, but might help a little. In general a stiffer sole is considered better, but this may lead to foot aches if you ride longer distances and can make walking in cycling shoes even trickier than it already is.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Closure mechanism</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Several years ago, laces on cycling shoes (remember them?) had a renaissance as an alternative to Velcro and buckles, as they spread the pressure more evenly over the top of the foot. They’re also lighter and potentially more aero, which is why you’ll still see lace-up shoes adorning the feet of the likes of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a>, despite their major drawback: a lack of adjustability while riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll still find Velcro and, less frequently, buckles on cycling shoes, but dial closure systems, including the Boa system and cheaper alternatives, are a popular choice. These use a cable – usually metal – to provide even tension over the shoe and have the advantage that they allow on-the-fly adjustability. It’s easier than dealing with laces but does come at a higher price than either Velcro or laces.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The best budget cycling shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Adidas The Road Cycling Shoe</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"830\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/03070400/the_road_cycling_shoes_black_fw4457_hm1.jpg\" alt=\"the_road_cycling_shoes_black_fw4457_hm1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/03070400/the_road_cycling_shoes_black_fw4457_hm1.jpg 830w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/03070400/the_road_cycling_shoes_black_fw4457_hm1-300x227.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/03070400/the_road_cycling_shoes_black_fw4457_hm1-768x581.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/03070400/the_road_cycling_shoes_black_fw4457_hm1-750x567.jpg 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£140 | <a href=\"https://fave.co/4161ahJ\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 568g (pair, size 42) </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pros: </strong>Lowish weight, Good looks</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cons: </strong>Fine weather shoes only, Sole not the stiffest </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A nostalgia kick to the days when Eddy Merckx and other top riders wore Adidas shoes, the brand returned to the cycling shoe fold after 15 years with its imaginatively named offering.

The Australian company traditionally uses a carbon tub that the foot sits in to provide a stiff platform, but the Motion shoes use a fibreglass sole to maintain similar levels of stiffness but at a more affordable price. I found the sole to be incredibly stiff, rivalling some carbon-soled offerings, which is mighty impressive for shoes at this price point.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The uppers are made from an anti-stretch microfibre, which Bont claims to be durable and the extensive perforations aid ventilation. Three Velcro straps secure the foot into the shoe. While it’s much tricker to adjust the tension on the move, they are very simple with almost nothing to fail, unlike a dial closure.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found the fit to be great, the narrow heel cup offering security and the wide toe box allowing my toes to spread out rather than be cramped up.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bont-motion-road-cycling-shoe-review\" target=\"_blank\">Bont Motion review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dhb Dorica Lace Carbon </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/DHB-Dorica-Lace-Carbon-9-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"DHB Dorica Lace Carbon road cycling shoes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/DHB-Dorica-Lace-Carbon-9-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/DHB-Dorica-Lace-Carbon-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/DHB-Dorica-Lace-Carbon-9-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/DHB-Dorica-Lace-Carbon-9-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/DHB-Dorica-Lace-Carbon-9-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/DHB-Dorica-Lace-Carbon-9-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/DHB-Dorica-Lace-Carbon-9-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/DHB-Dorica-Lace-Carbon-9-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/DHB-Dorica-Lace-Carbon-9-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/DHB-Dorica-Lace-Carbon-9-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Matt Buckley</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£85 | <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3RfOssd\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 552g (pair, size 46) </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pros: </strong>Classy looks, Stiff carbon sole, Very affordable </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cons: </strong>Lace closure limits adjustability</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Lace-up cycling shoes might not be everyone’s cup of tea but they offer a huge amount of adjustment in terms of tension down the foot. Couple this adjustability with a very stiff carbon sole and, dare I say, timeless design and the Dhb Dorica Lace shoes look like a great balance of price, performance and looks.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the road, I found the shoes to be supremely comfortable, providing ample support and comfort thanks to a generously padded heel cup. The 3K woven carbon sole felt very stiff even in all-out sprints but did not cause my feet to feel sore, which can sometimes be the case with overly harsh soles.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There no denying laces are nowhere near as convenient as a Boa dial or Velcro but I think they offer a worthy trade-off in terms of adjustability and they look great too. An elasticated pouch on the tongue keeps the laces tidy and secure.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/dhb-dorica-lace-carbon-cycling-shoes-review\" target=\"_blank\">Dhb Dorica Lace Carbon review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fizik Vento Omna </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Fizik-Tempo-Powerstrap-R5-4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik Vento Omna road cycling shoes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Fizik-Tempo-Powerstrap-R5-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Fizik-Tempo-Powerstrap-R5-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Fizik-Tempo-Powerstrap-R5-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Fizik-Tempo-Powerstrap-R5-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Fizik-Tempo-Powerstrap-R5-4-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Fizik-Tempo-Powerstrap-R5-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Fizik-Tempo-Powerstrap-R5-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Fizik-Tempo-Powerstrap-R5-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Fizik-Tempo-Powerstrap-R5-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Fizik-Tempo-Powerstrap-R5-4-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Matt Buckley</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£170 | <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/47IuEES\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 527g (Pair, size 46) </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Smart looks, Low weight, Dual-action Boa closure</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cons: </strong>Shoes tend to run hot</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vento Omnas are one of the Fizik’s budget road shoe offerings but certainly punch above their weight in terms of performance.
