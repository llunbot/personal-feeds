Initially, the range experienced an average depreciation of 28.8% in the first month. Intriguingly, this figure improved to 27.1% in the second month, indicating a regained value before a slight rise to 27.9% in the third month. Currently, the series stands at a depreciation of 27.4%, underscoring a trend of consistent value retention.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn comparison, Samsung's Galaxy S23 series was unable to match Apple's value retention. The S23 range saw a depreciation of 42.4% by the end of the first month, 43.5% in the second, and 44.5% by the third. This sequence highlights a much more significant drop in value than Apple's rival smartphone series, but it does represent a slight improvement over the company's previous S22 lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe OnePlus 11 series demonstrated a depreciation of 51.5% after two months, recovering to 48.5% in the third month. Google's Pixel 8 range struggled more significantly, with the flagship 1TB Pixel 8 Pro model losing 68.1% of its value in the first month and maintaining this level in the subsequent months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 15‌ range is also noticeably stronger in value retention compared to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>. Apple's latest devices are depreciating up to 11% less across all models, averaging a 5% better value retention than the ‌iPhone 14‌ range in the same post-launch period. Specifically, the 256GB ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus model shows a remarkable depreciation of only 11.3% less than its ‌iPhone 14‌ equivalent.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOverall, the data reinforces the longstanding trend of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> being the best smartphone for value retention and there are indications that this may even be improving further generation-over-generation. Buyers continue to be better off buying an Apple device if resale or trade-in is an essential future prospect.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sellcell/\">SellCell</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-leads-in-smartphone-resale-value/\">Apple Again Leads in Smartphone Resale Value With iPhone 15</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-again-leads-in-smartphone-resale-value-with-iphone-15.2416601/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ec23e7f02d09c3fe487d4c08f76557fe55e17c5ea80f09e611f71874848dba9e","category":"Apple"}
