{"title":"Charlie Sykes on the Stupidity of The Washington Post Spiking Ann Telnaes’s Cartoon","link":"https://charliesykes.substack.com/p/bowing-the-knee-again","date":1736108948000,"content":"\n<p>Charlie Sykes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To fully absorb the profound stupidity of the Wapo’s decision,\nconsider the alternative timeline in which the paper published\nTelnaes’s sketch. If the Wapo had published it, both the paper and\nBezos would have looked… <em>better</em>. The paper would have reasserted\na modicum of independence and integrity; and even Bezos would have\nbenefited.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of looking like a thin-skinned, craven autocrat, he would\nhave looked like someone big enough to tolerate criticism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And as Sykes’s post points out right at the start, the Streisand Effect is fully in play here.
