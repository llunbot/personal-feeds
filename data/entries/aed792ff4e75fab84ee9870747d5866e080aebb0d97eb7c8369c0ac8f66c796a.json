The Swedish spinoff announced that it is opening its order books for a cheaper, longer-range version of the Polestar 3 electric SUV <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/the-2025-polestar-3-is-a-torque-vectoring-suv-thats-fun-to-drive/\">that rather impressed us</a> when we drove it earlier this year. The Polestar 3 Long Range Single Motor will cost $67,500â€”well under the price cap for the IRS clean vehicle tax credit, for which it qualifies, as it is built in South Carolina.</p>\n<p>Dropping the front motor/generator unit means that the Polestar 3 LRSM is a good deal less powerful than the Long Range Dual Motor version we've driven, but 296 hp (220 kW) and 361 lb-ft (489 Nm) should ensure that while it isn't as fast, it shouldn't be any kind of slouch.</p>\n<p>And the boost in range should more than make up for any increase in 0-60 times. The Polestar 3 LRSM can go 350 miles (563 km) on a single charge of the 111 kWh battery, compared to 315 miles (507 km) for the Polestar 3 LRDM.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/new-single-motor-polestar-3-suv-starts-at-67500-orders-open-now/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/new-single-motor-polestar-3-suv-starts-at-67500-orders-open-now/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
