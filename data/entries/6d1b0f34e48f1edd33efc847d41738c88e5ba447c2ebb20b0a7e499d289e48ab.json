This 100W three-port Anker will handle everything without breaking a sweat, and the best part is that <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-Compact-MacBook/dp/B0CZ6LXL8R\">it’s only $46 at Amazon</a>. That’s an impressive 46 percent off its $85 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, this is a 100W GaN charger from Anker that can quickly charge your devices. Anker estimates that it can take your 14-inch MacBook Pro from 0 to half-full in half an hour, enough to get through most of a work day. One thing that makes this charger a great idea for those who often travel is that it comes with thick foldable prongs, which means it will take up less space and won’t snag on fabrics or scratch up your devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, this particular Anker model has three ports—two USB-C and one USB-A. Of course, it’s only when you use single-port charging you actually get the 100W max output via the type-C ports. But it’s no slouch when using all three ports at the same time, with the top USB-C port delivering 65W and the other two maxing out at 24W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and fix your charging woes by getting this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-Compact-MacBook/dp/B0CZ6LXL8R\">Anker 100W Prime Charger for just $46</a> while it’s still on sale. And if this is a stocking stuffer for your techie friend, then know it will arrive ahead of Christmas with time to spare if you order soon.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-Compact-MacBook/dp/B0CZ6LXL8R\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6d1b0f34e48f1edd33efc847d41738c88e5ba447c2ebb20b0a7e499d289e48ab","category":"Apple"}
