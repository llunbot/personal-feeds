Mondraker claims the carbon frame’s ride quality is improved to boot.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mondraker NEAT full suspension mountain eBike\" title=\"Mondraker NEAT headtube\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An imposing front end, ready for action.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Javier Garcia Juan / Mondraker</i></span></div>\n<p>This, along with the TQ motor system, means bikes come in at under 18kg.</p>\n<p>All the usual accoutrements are present, including neat cable routing from the front to rear triangle and a pair of Fidlock bosses. One of these is on the down tube and one is slung under the top tube – more on those later.</p>\n<p>And yes, cables do enter into the frame via the top cap of the headset.</p>\n<h2>Zero Suspension re-refined</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mondraker NEAT full suspension mountain eBike\" title=\"Mondraker NEAT zero suspension linkage\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Zero Suspension linkage has been around for a while, with a tweak to the lower shock mounting on the NEAT.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Javier Garcia Juan / Mondraker</i></span></div>\n<p>Mondraker has used its Zero Suspension system for 15 years, however the design has not remained static in that time.</p>\n<p>Zero Suspension is similar to many VPP systems, in that there are solid front and rear triangles joined by a pair of short links. This is done to help the company tune the feel of its suspension.</p>\n<p>Current versions of the Zero linkage have the shock mounted at the top and bottom to the two short links.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mondraker NEAT full suspension mountain eBike\" title=\"Mondraker NEAT alloy link\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Alloy links join the two triangles.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Javier Garcia Juan / Mondraker</i></span></div>\n<p>On the NEAT, this has been modified so the bottom mounting point of the shock is on the rear triangle, with the top still joined to the link.</p>\n<p>This ‘floating’ shock design means the shock is compressed from both ends.</p>\n<p>By altering the linkage, Mondraker claims to have improved stiffness, reduced weight and optimised the performance.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mondraker NEAT full suspension mountain eBike\" title=\"Mondraker NEAT controller\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The small wireless controller gives on-the-fly control of the power mode.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Javier Garcia Juan / Mondraker</i></span></div>\n<p>It also means weight is placed lower down in the bike, and enables the use of longer <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper posts</a> and improved space within the main triangle.</p>\n<p>It is said to have higher levels of anti-squat for improved reactivity to pedal inputs. Mondraker expects the bike to appeal more to riders who want to earn their descents than those who want the full punchy power of the Crafty Carbon.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mondraker NEAT full suspension mountain eBike\" title=\"Mondraker NEAT battery access\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The battery can be dropped out of this hole for a more regular-feeling, non-assisted ride.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Javier Garcia Juan / Mondraker</i></span></div>\n<p>It also has a higher leverage ratio, which gives increased early-stroke sensitivity.</p>\n<p>While the suspension might have similar anti-squat levels to the Foxy trail bike, it’s more progressive (24 per cent), reflecting the increased weight of the bike, and the expectation that it will be ridden hard.</p>\n<p>Expect to see this new version of the linkage on more pedal-focused powered and non-powered Mondrakers in the future.</p>\n<h2>Electric integration</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mondraker NEAT full suspension mountain eBike\" title=\"Mondraker NEAT TQ motor\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> TQ’s motor is mid-weight, mid-powered and very quiet.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Javier Garcia Juan / Mondraker</i></span></div>\n<p>After trying most options on the market, Mondraker settled with TQ to provide the assistance.</p>\n<p>The 1.85kg TQ HPR50 motor gives up to 300W of peak power, with 50Nm of torque. Its internal mechanism, which does away with belts and cogs, leads to a very quiet motor in use.</p>\n<p>The 360Wh battery has three power modes. Power levels and various data is shown on a top-tube mounted display, while there’s a wireless controller on the bars.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mondraker NEAT full suspension mountain eBike\" title=\"Mondraker NEAT top tube display\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Various data is shown via the top-tube display, with the button used to toggle through.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Javier Garcia Juan / Mondraker</i></span></div>\n<p>An app enables you to tune each mode’s maximum power level (from 30-300W), the assistance level (as a percentage of what you put in from 25-200 per cent) and the responsiveness of the motor to your pedal inputs.</p>\n<p>The 1.9kg battery can be removed and the bike ridden non-assisted if you wish.</p>\n<p>Additionally, 160Wh Range Extender batteries can be fitted. In theory, two can be mounted, using a locking mechanism, to the pair of Fidlock mounts in the frame.</p>\n<h2>Well-shaped</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mondraker NEAT full suspension mountain eBike\" title=\"Mondraker NEAT rear view\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The NEAT displays Mondraker’s familiar aesthetic.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Javier Garcia Juan / Mondraker</i></span></div>\n<p>Mondraker’s approach to geometry is well known, with its Forward Geometry concept being one of the first to adopt the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/spoke-tension-is-long-slack-and-low-geometry-always-better-our-tech-experts-give-us-their-angle/\">long, low, slack</a> philosophy.</p>\n<p>Mondraker has looked towards the Foxy Carbon and the Crafty Carbon again here, with similar numbers across the board.</p>\n<p>Reaches range from 450mm to 515mm across the four sizes, while the head angle is 64.5 degrees and the (effective) seat angle is 76.5 degrees.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mondraker NEAT full suspension mountain eBike\" title=\"Mondraker NEAT range extender\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A 160Wh Range Extender can be plugged in and a bottle, or second Range Extender, can be slung under the top tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Javier Garcia Juan / Mondraker</i></span></div>\n<p>The bottom bracket doesn’t drop too low, because Mondraker expects you to be tackling techy climbs, and doesn’t want you bashing your cranks off every rock.</p>\n<p>The chainstays are consistent in length across the sizes at 450mm.</p>\n<p>This isn’t particularly short, but because reach figures have grown over the years, Mondraker believes this provides a better, more balanced feel from front to rear.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mondraker NEAT full suspension mountain eBike\" title=\"Mondraker NEAT transmission\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM’s new Transmissions will be found on the top- and middle-tier bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Javier Garcia Juan / Mondraker</i></span></div>\n<p>Mondraker doesn’t recommend slinging a smaller 27.5in wheel in the NEAT, to make it a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-faster-mullet-bike-29er/\">mullet bike</a>.</p>\n<p>While the brand believes handling in steep and tight trails is improved, full <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29in wheels</a> provide better balance, more speed and improved climbing.
