In this case, the clue isn’t really in the name – gravel riding can encompass all types of terrain, from actual gravel to wooded singletrack and everything in between.</p>\n<p>As we’ll come on to, versatility is key when it comes to gravel bikes, and that extends to gravel riding as a whole. From super-chilled social rides to remote and demanding endurance racing, mass-participation events to dirt touring, there’s something in gravel for everyone.</p>\n<h2>Where did gravel riding come from?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"A female cyclist rides through cows during the FoCo Fondo gravel race\" title=\"A female cyclist rides through cows during the FoCo Fondo gravel race\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gravel is probably better understood as different types of riding coalescing rather than originating from one place or time.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Front Range Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Many will credit the US as the origin of gravel riding, where long, remote stretches of unpaved roads bridged the gap between road cycling, mountain biking and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cyclocross-racing/\">cyclocross racing</a>.</p>\n<p>Yet in the UK, the world’s oldest off-road cycling club, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-books/\">Rough Stuff Fellowship</a>, established in 1957, demonstrates that there was certainly more than one origin for the cycling discipline that we now largely call ‘gravel’.</p>\n<p>Taking the road (or should we say ‘groad’?) less travelled enables riders to hone their passion for exploration and adventure, and for some provides an opportunity to try a new racing discipline too. The variable terrain offers some riders a shift from the usual focus on the speed and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/science-cycling-conference-2021-5-frontiers-of-cycling-performance-to-watch-in-2022/\">science of road cycling</a> and often provides a respite from roads and traffic.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Diverge STR Expert gravel bike review BikeRadar\" title=\"Specialized Diverge STR Expert gravel bike review BikeRadar\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gravel bikes bring the fun back to moderately technical off-road descents.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>With mountain biking evolving to be more extreme and specialised over recent decades, gravel riding offers a more accessible discipline where riders can head out straight from their front door. These riders can now explore further afield and enjoy trails that would be relatively tame by modern mountain biking standards on rigid, drop-bar bikes that help make them a little more spicy again.</p>\n<p>Many gravel riders started out on modified cyclocross, mountain or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-touring-bike/\">touring bikes</a>, until the mainstream bike industry took note of the boom and began creating gravel-specific models, helping gravel to gain a foothold as a new global discipline.</p>\n<h2>Where can you ride gravel?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cyclist in orange top riding the Orro Terra S GRX600 gravel bike\" title=\"Orro Terra S GRX600 - 13\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gravel riding surfaces are much more diverse in Europe than in North America.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The US is hailed as the spiritual home of gravel riding, with a third of its 4.1 million-mile road network unpaved. It’s easy to see why the discipline and associated events have really taken off in North America, with such an abundance of great gravel roads from the Midwest prairies to the Colorado Rockies.</p>\n<p>The term ‘gravel’ might be a little misleading in the UK and some areas of Europe, however, and multi-terrain or adventure cycling might describe it better.</p>\n<p>You’re more likely to find routes linking up dirt doubletracks, flowy singletrack, forest fire roads, canal towpaths, field margin trails and farm roads with sections of tarmac in between, rather than long stretches of pristine gravel roads – depending where you’re riding, of course.</p>\n<p>It’s worth doing a little research into your local laws to find out where you can ride, or if you’re planning on taking your gravel bike on holiday. For example, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/uk-cycling-footpath-laws/\">in the UK you’re permitted to ride a bike on bridleways and byways but not on footpaths</a>, whereas in many European countries you can also ride on hiking routes.</p>\n<p>Just like mountain biking, weather and trail conditions are likely to dictate where you choose to ride. Better-draining areas are preferable for year-round riding. Boggier, muckier trails are best left for the drier summer months.</p>\n<h2>Do you need a gravel bike?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SRAM XPLR components on a Canyon Grizl gravel bike\" title=\"SRAM XPLR components on a Canyon Grizl gravel bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Canyon Grizl has many features you can expect to see on a gravel bike, from a suspension fork and wide tyres to 1x gears.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Gravel bike geometry, gearing and tyre clearance are all designed specifically to address the demands of off-road riding. While it’s not essential that you use one to ride off-road, they can make the ride much more comfortable and enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Don’t expect your gravel bike to be as responsive and speedy on the tarmac as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">best aero road bikes</a> or as capable as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">the best trail bikes</a>. A gravel bike is an enabler. You can enjoy the efficiency of riding <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-handlebars/\">gravel bike handlebars</a> on the roads and tamer tracks, while also tackling more technical trails that you wouldn’t dream of riding on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">road bike tyres</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Liam Cahill changing the wheel on a Lauf Seigla gravel bike.\" title=\"_MG_1391\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The option to swap wheels increases your gravel bike’s scope.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Many riders limited by space or budget choose a gravel bike with two wheelsets: a pair of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-wheels/\">gravel bike wheels</a> and one for road. Here, you can switch easily between tyres for on- and off-road use, although you should be aware that the gearing probably won’t be optimised for both disciplines.</p>\n<p>By now, you might be asking, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-gravel-bike/\">what is a gravel bike</a>?  We’ll answer this question by comparing and contrasting the gravel bike to its two-wheeled counterparts.</p>\n<h2>Is a gravel bike the same as a cyclocross bike?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tom Pidcock's Pinarello Crossista from the 2022 UCI Cyclo-Cross World Championships\" title=\"Tom Pidcock's Pinarello Crossista from the 2022 UCI Cyclo-Cross World Championships\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Many cyclocross bikes have race-focused geometry and forgo additional features, such as the Pinarello Crossista.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Will Palmer / SWPix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>Visual similarities between gravel bikes and cyclocross bikes belie quite significant differences.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cyclocross-bikes/\">best cyclocross bikes</a> are designed purely with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cyclocross-racing/\">cyclocross racing</a> in mind and are constrained by UCI rules dictating a maximum of 33mm tyres and bar width of 50cm. The geometry is race-focused, with a high bottom bracket, more aggressive riding position and sharp steering for tight cornering.</p>\n<p>Cyclocross bikes often lack <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguard</a> eyelets, rack mounts and multiple bottle cage bosses. These are unnecessary in hour-long races.</p>\n<p>As a result, cyclocross bike are okay but not ideal for gravel riding. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">best gravel bikes</a> offer much greater tyre clearance, more relaxed and stable geometry suitable for longer days in the saddle and rougher terrain, as well as more luggage-mounting options.</p>\n<p>The increasing specialisation of gravel does muddy the waters. For instance, the best gravel race bikes are more closely related to cyclocross bikes than <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aluminium-gravel-bikes/\">aluminium gravel bikes</a> designed for multi-day adventures.</p>\n<h2>Do you need a gravel bike if you have a hardtail mountain bike?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Revolt X Advanced Pro 1 gravel bike\" title=\"Giant Revolt X Advanced Pro 1 - 13\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gravel bike or hardtail mountain bike? The line between the two can be pretty thin.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There’s certainly nothing wrong with riding <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hardtail-mountain-bikes/\">hardtail mountain bikes</a>, or even a rigid MTB without a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-suspension-forks/\">suspension fork</a> on gravel tracks and trails.</p>\n<p>The rigidity of a typical gravel bike frameset combined with a drop-bar position offers greater pedalling and aerodynamic efficiency on roads and gravel tracks.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon own brand cockpit on the Canyon Grail AL 6 WMN gravel bike\" title=\"Canyon Grail AL 6 WMN 11\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gravel bikes tend to pair wide drop bars with short, mountain bike-like stems.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robyn Furtado / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For longer rides and multi-day bikepacking tours, you’ll also find that a drop handlebar offers more varied hand positions, which can be beneficial for minimising hand and wrist discomfort.</p>\n<p>For Deborah Goodall, organiser of the Yorkshire True Grit event in the North York Moors, gravel riding takes her back to the early days of riding her rigid mountain bike.</p>\n<p>“If I went out on the same tracks and paths on my current mountain bike, it wouldn’t excite me because the bikes handle it too easily,” she says. “But with a drop-bar gravel bike, you get to the bottom of a descent, look back and think ‘I can’t believe I’ve just got down that’.”</p>\n<h2>Why are tyres so important for gravel riding?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"WTB Vulpine SG2 gravel tyre\" title=\"WTB Vulpine SG2 tyre - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A gravel tyre for dry conditions will have a low shoulder tread.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">best gravel bike tyres</a> can make the difference between having a blast on your ride or a total nightmare. As the contact point between your bike and the terrain you’re tackling, you’ll need to match your tyre type, tread, volume and gravel tyre pressure to the trails and conditions you anticipate encountering.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">Tubeless tyres</a> come highly recommended for off-road riding since you’re likely to find thorns and sharp rocks off-road, and this will also allow you to run lower tyre pressures with a decreased risk of pinch flats. That said, it’s still possible to cause a snakebite puncture in your tyre with a tubeless setup, so getting the tyre pressure right is key.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Grail AL 6 WMN gravel bike\" title=\"Canyon Grail AL 6 WMN gravel bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 650b wheels enable riders to run wider tyres without changing frameset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robyn Furtado / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Tyre widths vary from 32mm to over 50mm, or 2.1in. The most common tyre width tends to be around 40mm. The width you choose to run with depends on your frame’s tyre clearance, as well as the pressures you’d like to run.</p>\n<p>Larger tyres will enable you to run lower pressures, giving more comfort, as well as allowing you to tackle more technical terrain with greater confidence.</p>\n<p>Many riders limited on tyre clearance opt for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-650b/\">650b wheels</a> and tyres (27.5in equivalent), so they can run wider tyres without changing the frameset.</p>\n<p>Trail conditions determine which tread you should use. Balance the need for grip and speed, based on the terrain and the weather. For example, opt for a more aggressive, knobbly tread for wetter, muddier conditions, or a slicker tread for dry hardpack.</p>\n<h2>How have gravel bikes and kit evolved?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Basso Palta Disc Ekar gravel bike\" title=\"Basso Palta Disc Ekar - 09\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The groupset big three all have gravel-specific options.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Over the last few years, we’ve witnessed a huge surge in the number of bikes and amount of specifically designed kit on offer, in parallel with the growing popularity of gravel riding.</p>\n<p>Shimano, SRAM and Campagnolo have all launched gravel bike groupsets designed with a greater gear range than typical road cycling groupsets, and these have become commonplace on many <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-setup/\">gravel bike setups</a>.</p>\n<p>There are increasing numbers of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-gravel-bikes/\">electric gravel bikes</a> available too, allowing more riders to explore further and steeper than ever before.</p>\n<p>Flared handlebars are now very common for gravel bikes, giving greater stability on the drops, and some riders opt for much wider bars than you’d typically find on road bikes.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Revolt X Advanced Pro 1 gravel bike\" title=\"Giant Revolt X Advanced Pro 1 - 05\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Suspension is becoming more common on gravel bikes and opens up a wider range of trails and routes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Several technologies are coming across from the mountain biking world to gravel riding.</p>\n<p>The integration of suspension into stems and seatposts aims to relieve discomfort caused by rougher terrain. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-gravel-bike-trends/\">Gravel bike suspension</a> is now also available in the form of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/rockshox-rudy-ultimate-xplr-fork-review/\">RockShox Rudy Ultimate XPLR fork</a> (30 or 40mm travel), the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/lauf-grit-fork-review/\">Lauf Grit fork</a> (30mm travel) and even <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/niner-mcr-9-rdo-gravel-bike/\">Niner’s MCR 9 RDO full suspension gravel bike</a> (50mm travel).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-dropper-posts/\">Gravel bike dropper posts</a>, which lower the seatpost and your centre of gravity on steep descents, and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tubeless-tyre-inserts/\">tubeless tyre inserts</a>, lightweight foam hoops that reduce your puncture risk, also have MTB origins.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-clothing/\">Gravel-specific clothing</a> and shoes have become more popular too.

The way the terrain moves under you contrasts to the predictability of the road.</p>\n<p>There are a few different <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/how-to-ride-gravel/\">gravel riding techniques</a> that you’ll learn with time. Already having some <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/technique/cyclocross-skills/\">cyclocross skills</a> or mountain bike prowess can really help.</p>\n<p>On loose-gravel ascents, stay seated rather than climb out of the saddle, just like riding uphill on a muddy cyclocross course. This’ll keep your weight over the back wheel and prevent it spinning out.</p>\n<p>Cornering on gravel roads is also different from tarmac. You should look for the smoothest line, avoiding any chunkier, loose gravel if possible. Taking the inside line can give you more wiggle room when it comes to exiting the corner, so if anything goes wrong you have more space to correct your line than if you were cornering on the outside.</p>\n<p>When the terrain becomes more technical, line choice becomes increasingly important, just as it does in mountain biking. For a fast ride, look for the smoothest line, avoiding larger rocks, roots and looser sections.</p>\n<p>Keep looking ahead at the trail features coming up rather than concentrating on what’s in front of your wheel.</p>\n<h2>Is gravel riding harder than road riding?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" title=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gravel riding is harder going than cruising on smooth tarmac.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As our senior technical editor-in-chief Robin Weaver <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/five-things-i-learnt-riding-dirty-reiver/\">learnt from riding the Dirty Reiver</a>, a timed gravel event on the England/Scotland border, completing 100km of gravel is much harder than on the road.</p>\n<p>While riding gravel, there is more rolling resistance from the rougher, bumpy surface and your grippier tyres.
