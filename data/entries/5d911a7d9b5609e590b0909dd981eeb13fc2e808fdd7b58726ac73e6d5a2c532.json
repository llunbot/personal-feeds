Apple in September discontinued the Lightning-based version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> 2 and instead swapped over to USB-C, and ColorWare is already able to make them in unique colors\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/colorware-airpods-pro-usb-c-1.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nColorWare has been offering custom-painted Apple products and accessories for more than two decades now, and this is <em>the</em> company to go with if you want AirPods or Apple devices in shades that are less boring than Apple's default colors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/colorware-airpods-pro-usb-c-3.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nAll of ColorWare's products come in hundreds of unique color combinations, and it customizes AirPods, ‌AirPods Pro‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a>, Magic Mouse, and accessories like consoles and controllers from companies like Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/colorware-airpods-pro-usb-c-4.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nCustom <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/p-1405-airpods-pro-2nd-gen-usb-c.aspx?c=variant-142*l02-9ngo*l03-9nit*l04-9njs\">second-generation AirPods Pro 2 with a USB-C port</a> are available from ColorWare for $439, a price that includes colorization for both of the AirPods and the accompanying USB-C <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> Charging Case. If you just want to customize the earbuds, that can be done for $389.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/colorware-airpods-pro-usb-c-5.jpg\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1124\" />\r<br />\nThere's a premium price tag for ordering from ColorWare, but with ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 only available in white, this is the sole way to get AirPods in black, red, blue, orange, or dozens of other colors. With the holidays coming up, custom AirPods are a unique gift you won't find elsewhere.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/colorware-airpods-pro-usb-c-6.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nColorWare also has a multi-step coating process that includes a primer, the application of a proprietary color formula, and an X2 liquid plastic coating that protects the color. Custom painting is guaranteed for 12 months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can get both solid and metallic paint options from ColorWare, along with gloss and matte finishes depending on personal preference. There are traditional silver, gray, and gold colors that match Apple devices, but colors in every shade of the rainbow are available too.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/colorware-airpods-pro-usb-c-7.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nEach AirPod can be painted the same color as the case, or you can get the case and the earbuds all in different colors, which leads to thousands of color combinations to chose from.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nColorWare even offers custom colors <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/p-1419-colorware-cowpods-pro-pink.aspx?c=variant-14h\">like the \"CowPods Pro\"</a> that features a case with a cow print, or the <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/p-1418-colorware-airpods-pro-2nd-gen-supernova.aspx?c=variant-14g\">black holographic Supernova set</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/colorware-airpods-pro-usb-c-2.jpg\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1124\" />\r<br />\nTo create its custom accessories, ColorWare uses standard second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ with USB-C case directly from Apple, which means the full AirPods functionality is intact.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have two sets of custom ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 with USB-C port to give away to <em>MacRumors</em> readers.
