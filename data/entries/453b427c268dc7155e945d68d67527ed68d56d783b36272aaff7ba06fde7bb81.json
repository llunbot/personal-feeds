The RX 6600 is a midrange GPU that will slot in under the $379 RX 6600XT in AMD's lineup, and the site claims it will be available on October 13.</p>\n<p>By themselves, we don't put a lot of stock in retailer listings, since they can be speculative placeholders rather than a confirmation that a given product is being launched. But this one came complete with box art and photos of the card, which confirms that it will come with 8GB of GDDR6 memory, and, like the RX 6600 XT, it will be sold primarily as a 1080p card. The GPU is said to include 1,792 of AMD's Stream Processors, compared to 2,048 on the RX 6600 XT, while retaining the same 128-bit memory interface as the XT.</p>\n<p>A single 8-pin power connector, three DisplayPorts, and a single HDMI port are also visible in the photos, and the card's short length will make it one of the few modern GPUs suitable for small-form-factor PC builds. What the listing doesn't tell us is what the GPU will cost; the listed price of 589.90 euro works out to about $690 in US dollars, at least twice as high as we think the card's official price is likely to be.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798884#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798884&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"453b427c268dc7155e945d68d67527ed68d56d783b36272aaff7ba06fde7bb81","category":"Tech"}
