Nevertheless, demand for iPads remains strong, with total ‌iPad‌ shipments in the first nine months of this year totaling 40.3 million, up 17.83% from the same time a year ago, according to IDC data.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe last time Apple prioritized iPhones over iPads was last year, when it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/05/ipad-parts-used-in-iphone-12-to-combat-shortages/\">reallocated</a> some ‌iPad‌ parts to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> amid supply chain constraints during the peak of the global health crisis.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/28/apple-4q-2021-earnings/\">financial results</a> for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021 revealed all-time record revenues for Mac and Services, but Apple's performance was only roughly in line with analyst expectations and was almost certainly held back by component shortages that have led to lengthy shipping estimates for many products.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nikkei-com/\">nikkei.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13\">iPhone 13 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13-Pro\">iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/02/apple-shifts-ipad-parts-to-iphone-13-shortages/\">Apple Reportedly Using iPad Components in iPhone 13 to Offset Shortages</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-using-ipad-components-in-iphone-13-to-offset-shortages.2321330/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mmWgHkpWRC4:_PG3YYBZhmM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mmWgHkpWRC4:_PG3YYBZhmM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/mmWgHkpWRC4\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3778f59ab113618f62236bc36579d20327fc03da24ff83febc5bcc9255fff855","category":"Apple"}
