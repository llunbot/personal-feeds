Previous generation Tarmac models and SL7 bikes currently in store but unsold already have the new components fitted, according to Specialized.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-specialized-tarmac/\">Tarmac SL7 was launched in July 2020</a> as the US brand’s all-encompassing road bike, superseding the Tarmac SL6 and replacing the Venge as “one bike to rule them all”.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The recall relates to the new Tarmac’s headset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>“At Specialized, the rider is the boss, and that means ensuring the bikes and equipment we make will provide years of safe and confidence-inspiring performance,” reads Specialized’s statement.</p>\n<p>“We will be announcing a voluntary recall of Tarmac SL7 bicycles because harsh impacts may put extraordinary stress on headset components and may initiate a crack in the fork’s steerer tube.</p>\n<p>“We will improve the overall system with the addition of a new extended expander plug and an upgrade of the compression ring for riders that do not have one already.</p>\n<p>“We will be asking riders to stop riding their Tarmac SL7 and head to their local retailer and have these new parts installed. Retailers worldwide have the parts in stock and installation will be a simple process.</p>\n<p>“As with any severe impact or accident, riders should always have their bike inspected at their local retailer, but they can also rest assured that the Tarmac SL7 meets or exceeds all industry safety standards.</p>\n<p>“Only Tarmac SL7 models already on the road will need this improvement. Tarmac SL6 and previous models do not require any action, and all Tarmac SL7 currently in-store and in the future will have these new components.”</p>","author":"George Scott","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"6329ac4cc8439a560292f3687aaa76cb07ea3972a2f3f7b079f5475cf675dd88","category":"Cycling"}
