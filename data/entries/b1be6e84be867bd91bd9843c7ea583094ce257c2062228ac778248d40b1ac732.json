Machines that make ice cream, however, seem to have a special place in the hearts of lawmakers. Those machines are often broken and locked down for only the most profitable repairs.</p>\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission and the antitrust division of the Department of Justice have <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/ATR-FTC-JointComment.pdf\">asked the US Copyright Office</a> (PDF) to exempt \"commercial soft serve machines\" from the anti-circumvention rules of <a href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2018/\">Section 1201</a> of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The governing bodies also submitted proprietary diagnostic kits, programmable logic controllers, and enterprise IT devices for DMCA exemptions.</p>\n<p>\"In each case, an exemption would give users more choices for third-party and self-repair and would likely lead to cost savings and a better return on investment in commercial and industrial equipment,\" the joint comment states. Those markets would also see greater competition in the repair market, and companies would be prevented from using DMCA laws to enforce monopolies on repair, according to the comment.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010468#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010468&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b1be6e84be867bd91bd9843c7ea583094ce257c2062228ac778248d40b1ac732","category":"Tech"}
