LG's new StanbyME Go (<a href=\"https://www.lge.co.kr/tvs/27lx5qkna\">27LX5QKNA</a>) tends to such concerns with a 4.69-inch-thick (119 mm), supposedly military-grade briefcase to which a massive 27-inch tablet is permanently attached.</p>\n<h2>LG’s not selling it in the US (yet)</h2>\n<p>The wacky design, spotted recently by sites like <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/the_lg_stanbyme_go_puts_a_screen_and_some_speakers_inside_a_briefcase-news-58736.php\">GSMArena</a>, is listed on LG's South Korean website as being available starting June 7, as per a Google translation of the page.</p>\n<p>Ars Technica asked LG if there is a US price or release date, and a spokesperson said the company didn't \"have anything to share in regard to US plans at this time.\" However, the device does seem to be available at South Korea's <a href=\"https://yootoypia.com/products/lg-stanbyme-go-stand-by-me-2-portable-touch-screen-27lx5qkna\">YooTopia</a> website to US shoppers for $1,050.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1945476#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1945476&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4ca184bca686e8ac0fa9ac6ad4dc9057817172df3ec61229fcc0e6be5481ddca","category":"Tech"}
