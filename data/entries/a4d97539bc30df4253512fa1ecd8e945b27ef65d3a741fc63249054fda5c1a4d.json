{"title":"Motorola Razr and Razr Ultra (2025) review: Cool as hell, but too much AI","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/motorola-razr-and-razr-ultra-2025-review-cool-as-hell-but-too-much-ai/","date":1747314010000,"content":"<p>For phone nerds who've been around the block a few times, the original Motorola Razr is undeniably iconic. The era of foldables has allowed Motorola to resurrect the Razr in an appropriately flexible form, and after a few generations of refinement, the 2025 Razrs are spectacular pieces of hardware.
