The new front and rear Thru Axles offer another option for UDH-equipped bikes. After many years, in tandem with the release of the new Thru Axles, Hope thought it was time to refresh and release updated finishing kits as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Thru Axles</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Hope-Thru-Axles-and-Finishing-Kits-New-thru-axles.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Hope-Thru-Axles-and-Finishing-Kits-New-thru-axles.jpeg\" alt=\"Hope Thru Axles and Finishing Kits New thru axles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Hope-Thru-Axles-and-Finishing-Kits-New-thru-axles.jpeg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Hope-Thru-Axles-and-Finishing-Kits-New-thru-axles-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Hope-Thru-Axles-and-Finishing-Kits-New-thru-axles-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Hope-Thru-Axles-and-Finishing-Kits-New-thru-axles-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Hope-Thru-Axles-and-Finishing-Kits-New-thru-axles-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Hope-Thru-Axles-and-Finishing-Kits-New-thru-axles-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Hope Tech)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the wide use of UDH Hope thought it was time to offer the Hope Rear Thru Axle.
