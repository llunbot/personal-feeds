I’ve ridden it around the desert of Utah, taken it on a three-day bikepacking ride to the NC coast, and raced it in the NC Belgian Waffle Ride.</p><p>Through it all, I’ve probably put close to 600 miles on it and haven’t found a single thing to complain about. Whether stripped down with ultralight race wheels or loaded with bags and aero road wheels, it’s performed flawlessly and been an absolute joy to ride.

Even if it did take them a few years longer than anyone else to launch a proper gravel bike, I’d say it was worth the wait. It’s light, even with bigger tires and stout Fulcrum wheels, and it rode like a lightweight bike in all the right ways.</p><p>Meaning, it really is compliant. I could sit and hammer or just cruise along comfortably for hours over embedded rocks and undulating terrain. From the thin, low seatstays to the 27.2 carbon seatpost to the thin fork legs, Fezzari built a bike that’s a true rider’s gravel bike.</p><p>So, naturally, I turned it into a road bike:</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29171629/Fezzari-Shafer-gravel-road-bike-review-bikepacking-setup-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29171629/Fezzari-Shafer-gravel-road-bike-review-bikepacking-setup-1.jpg\" alt=\"fezzari shafer gravel bike with road wheels and frame bags\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29171629/Fezzari-Shafer-gravel-road-bike-review-bikepacking-setup-1.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29171629/Fezzari-Shafer-gravel-road-bike-review-bikepacking-setup-1-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29171629/Fezzari-Shafer-gravel-road-bike-review-bikepacking-setup-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29171629/Fezzari-Shafer-gravel-road-bike-review-bikepacking-setup-1-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29171629/Fezzari-Shafer-gravel-road-bike-review-bikepacking-setup-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>After a couple of months, I’d kinda fallen for it, so I wanted to see how it handled real long distances.

Apidura’s Expedition Series top tube, frame, and saddle bags were strapped on and loaded up (read my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/07/19/review-apidura-expedition-bikepacking-frame-bags-work-for-any-size-adventure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">review of those bags here</a>).</p><p>I’d done several group road rides prior to the trip, and the bike handled as well as any endurance road bike I’ve ridden. Still super comfortable, and I like that the top tube is quite narrow as my knees tend to move inward at the top of my pedal stroke.</p><p>I also like that they spec a straight (zero setback) seatpost, since this is usually something I’d replace on bikes with a setback post. I prefer my saddle a little more forward, over the pedals, and this bike fit me really, really well straight out of the box. Which is good, because I’d picked it up from one of their reps and skipped the usual 23-point fit process Fezzari’s customers usually go through.</p><p>Fully loaded, the Shafer still handled really well, and the stable geometry kept me cruising straight and comfortable, averaging a mellow ~85 miles per day.</p><p>So, then, I decided to race it…</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30124427/fezzari-shafer-gravel-bike-belgian-waffle-ride-build.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30124427/fezzari-shafer-gravel-bike-belgian-waffle-ride-build.jpg\" alt=\"fezzari shafer gravel bike setup for racing the belgian waffle ride nc\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30124427/fezzari-shafer-gravel-bike-belgian-waffle-ride-build.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30124427/fezzari-shafer-gravel-bike-belgian-waffle-ride-build-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30124427/fezzari-shafer-gravel-bike-belgian-waffle-ride-build-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30124427/fezzari-shafer-gravel-bike-belgian-waffle-ride-build-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/30124427/fezzari-shafer-gravel-bike-belgian-waffle-ride-build-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>Unfortunately, this is the best/only pic I have of the bike from the inaugural Belgian Waffle Ride NC.</p><p>This time, I subbed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://industrynine.com/wheels/road/ul250c-cx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Industry Nine UL250 Carbon CX</a> wheels because they’re just about the lightest things out there for gravel racing, and BWR had almost 10,000 feet of climbing in store for us.
