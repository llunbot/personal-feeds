And per the latest rumor, the C1 modem will continue to roll out later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-c1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nIn a research note with investment firm GF Securities today, analyst Jeff Pu said the ultra-thin \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/15/ultra-thin-iphone-17-rumors/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>\" will be equipped with the C1 modem. Fellow analyst Ming-Chi Kuo was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/\">first to reveal that this was Apple's plan</a> last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu believes Apple's second-generation C2 modem will debut in the iPhone 18 Pro models next year, which is also something that has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/apple-c2-modem-iphone-18-pro-feature/\">already been rumored previously</a>. Look for the C2 modem to be faster overall, and for it to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/\">gain mmWave support</a> in the United States. Further power efficiency improvements are likely too.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone 17 Pro models are expected to have Qualcomm modems still.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's modem supply agreement with Qualcomm <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-extends-qualcomm-modem-licensing-deal/\">runs through March 2027</a>, so the company still has time to transition to its own custom-designed modems. Apple develops chips several years before they ship, so it should come as no surprise that the company is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/apple-integrate-future-modems-main-processor/\">already working on its next-generation C2 and C3 modems</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said the C1 modem is already the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-battery-life/\">most power-efficient iPhone modem ever</a>, and it held up fine in both real-world and simulated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/apple-c1-modem-5g-speed-tests/\">5G speed test results</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/\">Apple 5G Modem</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/iphone-18-pro-c2-modem-rumor/\">iPhone 18 Pro Models Again Rumored to Feature Apple's C2 Modem</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-pro-models-again-rumored-to-feature-apples-c2-modem.2453369/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9770cf3d4174b273d303703c0dad87c246b1846421fc5e79648a06421940aef2","category":"Apple"}
