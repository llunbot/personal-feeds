With remaining stock now limited to retailers and partners, there is likely no successor to the Studio 2+ planned. This effectively ends Microsoft's efforts to compete in the high-end all-in-one market dominated by Apple's ‌iMac‌, a fixture of creative workspaces for decades.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFirst introduced in 2016, the Surface Studio formed an attempt to challenge Apple's hold on the creative professional market. Its standout feature was a 28-inch 4.5K PixelSense touchscreen mounted on a unique hinge that allowed the display to tilt into a flat, drafting-table position. Paired with accessories like the Surface Dial and Surface Pen, the Studio was designed to attract graphic designers, illustrators, and video editors. Despite its innovative design, the Surface Studio struggled to gain significant traction due to its steep price point, which started at $2,999 for the original model, and its reliance on hardware components that were frequently a generation behind current industry standards.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's also notable that Microsoft has discontinued other Surface products such as the Surface Duo and Surface Earbuds. In recent years, Microsoft has pivoted toward productivity-focused hardware, such as its Surface Pro and Surface Laptop lines, and enterprise-oriented services like its Copilot AI tools. Meanwhile, Apple has continued to update the ever-popular ‌iMac‌ with new hardware, most recently with the M4 chip, new color options, a 12-megapixel camera with Center Stage and Desk View, and a nano-texture display option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMicrosoft's decision to discontinue the Surface Studio line could leave a void in the Windows all-in-one market. While companies like HP and Lenovo continue to produce all-in-one PCs, none match the Surface Studio's combination of touch capabilities, drafting-table functionality, and premium design. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft-surface/\">Microsoft Surface</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft-surface-studio/\">Microsoft Surface Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/surface/\">Surface</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/microsoft-discontinues-imac-rival-surface-studio/\">Microsoft Discontinues iMac Rival Surface Studio 2+</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-discontinues-imac-rival-surface-studio-2.2444763/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7a4ba50b9a95e5a7887faae4e3c5f33f894c36ab4c20db9a6824cd8a5bfd9acb","category":"Apple"}
