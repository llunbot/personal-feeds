On December 31, another leaker known as <a href=\"https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1874078173802942732\">Majin Bu on X also cited a source</a> who said the device's name will be iPhone 16E.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear if the name would use a capital E, or if the name would end up being iPhone 16e, or iPhone 16 with an <a href=\"https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+1F134#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%F0%9F%84%B4%E2%80%9D%20U%2B1F134%20Squared%20Latin%20Capital%20Letter%20E%20Unicode%20Character\">E inside a square</a>. Or perhaps iPhone 16 SE? Or, this rumor is simply wrong and Apple sticks with iPhone SE branding.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Fixed Focus Digital\" doesn't have a very established <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/\">track record with Apple rumors</a> yet. The account accurately claimed the iPhone 16 Pro models would be available in a new bronze finish, which ended up being Desert Titanium, but the color had already been rumored at the time. On the other hand, the account was wrong about the number of iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus color options that would be available. The account's make-or-break moment will mostly come down to whether its claims about the iPhone SE's successor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/19/iphone-se-4-likely-to-use-iphone-16-chassis/\">using the same chassis as the iPhone 16</a> and being named iPhone 16E prove to be accurate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn any case, the device is said to have a similar design as the base iPhone 14, which is similar to the base iPhone 16. Rumored features include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a USB-C port, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, a newer A-series chip and 8GB of RAM <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/new-iphone-se-and-ipad-air-early-2025-rumor/\">for Apple Intelligence</a>, and the first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-5g-modem-plans-report/\">Apple-designed 5G modem</a>. It is not clear if the device will have an Action button, which debuted on the iPhone 15 Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple announced the current iPhone SE during an online event <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-announces-new-iphone-se/\">in March 2022</a>. The device looks similar to the iPhone 8, with outdated features such as a Touch ID button, Lightning port, and thick bezels around the display. In the U.S., the iPhone SE currently starts at $429, but at least a slight price increase seems likely for the next model.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/\">Fixed Focus Digital</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/\">Majin Bu</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/01/iphone-se-4-rumored-to-be-named-iphone-16e/\">'iPhone SE 4' Rumored to Be Named 'iPhone 16E'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-rumored-to-be-named-iphone-16e.2446525/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d929df0f08f1b3b656b0b8444498d6f987a52d7fa4072566f200dce6ee8b3d8c","category":"Apple"}
