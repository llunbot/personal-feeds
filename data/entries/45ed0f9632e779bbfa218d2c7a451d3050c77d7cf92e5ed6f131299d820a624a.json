Dolly generated global headlines just by being alive, as she was the first mammal to be cloned using DNA taken from body (somatic) cells.</p>\n<p>In this form of cloning, a somatic cell provides the cloned animal's complete DNA, which is then injected into an unfertilized egg cell that has had its existing genetic material removed. Zap the egg with a bit of current, implant it into the womb of a surrogate mother, wait a few months, and bamâ€”out pops Dolly.</p>\n<p>The process proved that the magic of embryonic development wasn't hidden only in eggs and sperm; even somatic cells from mature animals were capable of reproducing the whole creature and of generating any cell needed by the developing embryo.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053473#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053473&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"45ed0f9632e779bbfa218d2c7a451d3050c77d7cf92e5ed6f131299d820a624a","category":"Tech"}
