The system is automatic, always-on, and works to provide the best possible performance. Power needs are dynamically monitored, and performance is managed to address these needs in real time. The system allows Apple Vision Pro to balance and reduce performance impacts as much as possible. The user may or may not notice effects on device, which may be temporary. Depending on the device battery state and the tasks that your Apple Vision Pro is handling, some examples of these effects may include longer app launch times, lower frame rates, reduced wireless data throughput, screen dimming, or lower speaker volume.</blockquote>Apple introduced a similar system on older iPhone models back in 2017, but it failed to mention the system in its iOS release notes at the time, leading to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-slowdown/\">major controversy</a>. Apple eventually <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/06/apple-starts-iphone-batterygate-payouts/\">agreed to pay up to $500 million</a> to settle a class action lawsuit that accused the company of \"secretly throttling\" some iPhone models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNowadays, the system is considered by many to be a helpful feature that ensures smooth performance and prevents unexpected shutdowns.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/vision-pro-battery-management-system/\">Apple Says Vision Pro Performance Could Be Reduced in Some Situations</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-vision-pro-performance-could-be-reduced-in-some-situations.2418173/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9c807a10ff1dd5b993cb655e952a2f03b1ff9d7d4163cec937fb9e2f6d617c3e","category":"Apple"}
