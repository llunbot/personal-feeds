With an MSRP of $1,099, you can get <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J8BD6L/\">the M2 iPad Air with 512GB of storage for just $899</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is Apple’s first 13-inch iPad Air, featuring a gorgeous display, a great processor, and a fantastic design. It also has 8GB of RAM so it’s ready for Apple Intelligence, which arrived with iOS 18.1. More features will be rolled out over the coming months as well, so you’ll want a device that’s capable of handling it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365408/11-inch-ipad-air-m2-review.html\">We reviewed the 11-inch version of the M2 iPad Air</a> and gave it a 4-star rating. One of the things we wanted was better brightness, which this model has. The display on the 13-inch Air can be pushed up to 600nits, which is great for use indoors or out. And given its size, you can turn this tablet into a productivity tool by getting a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL7J12YK\">USB-C Apple Pencil</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09327XWMP\">Magic Keyboard</a>, both of which are on sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and place your order for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J8BD6L/\">13-inch M2 iPad Air for $899</a> and skip Black Friday, because we don’t think you’ll get a better price this year.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get the new M2 iPad Air for its best price</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J8BD6L/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4b1393d2a17e51fa0b3480d29e6d542ca6e71b5850963a6610e3232d32257114","category":"Apple"}
