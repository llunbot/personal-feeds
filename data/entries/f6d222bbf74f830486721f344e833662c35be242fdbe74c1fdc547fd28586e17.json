The carrier says that “just over 40 million records of former or prospective customers who had previously applied for credit with T-Mobile” were part of the hack. It doesn’t say how far back the data was stored. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>T-Mobile says the leak includes “first and last names, date of birth, SSN, and driver’s license/ID information” for current and former postpay customers as well as prospective T-Mobile customers. The numbers break down like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Just over 40 million records of former or prospective customers</li><li>Approximately 7.8 million current T-Mobile postpaid customer accounts’ information</li><li>Approximately 850,000 active T-Mobile prepaid customers</li></ul><p>Additionally, the company says there was “some additional information” from inactive prepaid accounts accessed through prepaid billing files. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>T-Mobile says that it hasn’t uncovered evidence of “any customer financial information, credit card information, debit or other payment information.” However, it has reset the PINs on affected accounts “to help protect these customers” and recommends all T-Mobile postpaid customers reset their PINs as a precaution. It says there weren’t any Metro by T-Mobile, former Sprint prepaid, or Boost customers who had their names or PINs exposed but those customers might want to change their PIN as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, the carrier is offering two years of free identity protection services with McAfee’s ID Theft Protection Service as well as Account Takeover Protection capabilities for postpaid customers. It will be contacting the affected individuals with more information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>T-Mobile is still investigating the attack. The original report claimed hackers had stolen data related to more than 100 million customers with “full customer info,” though financial information doesn’t appear to have been part of the breach.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f6d222bbf74f830486721f344e833662c35be242fdbe74c1fdc547fd28586e17","category":"Apple"}
