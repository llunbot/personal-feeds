Now, Apple device prototype collector \"Kosutami\" has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1693554859004617077?s=20\">affirmed</a> that they have seen design validation test (DVT) samples of the color-matched braided USB-C cables and they are apparently destined to come alongside the ‌iPhone 15‌ and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the exception of the black version, each of the cables has a glossy white plastic shell at either end. Unlike the Apple Watch magnetic charging cable and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> 3, the braided USB-C cables feature strain relief tubes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKosutami told <em>MacRumors</em> that they are anticipating that these cables will at least come in white, black, yellow, purple, and orange color options. It seems that this orange shade will be closer to a pink, perhaps like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> XR's Coral color option. Each of these cable colors should match up with a corresponding ‌iPhone 15‌ color option. A <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/23/iphone-15-color-options/\">single rumor</a> from February suggested that the ‌iPhone 15‌ will be available in Pink and Blue, but it is otherwise unknown what specific color options the new devices could come in.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo date, all ‌iPhone‌ models have come with a white cable featuring a white rubber jacket, regardless of the color option chosen for the device itself. Apple has gradually been moving to braided cables across most of its devices, and all <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> and MacBook Pro models with ‌MagSafe‌ 3 come with a color-matched braided cable, so doing the same for the ‌iPhone‌ seems plausible amid its transition to USB-C.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max will also apparently come with color-matched braided USB-C to USB-C cables, <em>MacRumors</em> has been told.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/\">Majin Bu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/\">Kosutami</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/\">iPhone 15 Could Come With Color-Matched Braided USB-C Cables [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-braided-usb-c-cables-updated.2399201/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b75b1fb5170b33ce94b849901ecc8048b5c95748dd2d1b975239a72abac8663a","category":"Apple"}
