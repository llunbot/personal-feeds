The mount features rubber pads that rest on the frame, while TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) straps are used to keep it in place – requiring no steer tube strap.</p>\n<p>The Top Tube Packs can also be bolted directly onto bikes that feature cage mounts on the top tube. This is a feature on many of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">the best gravel bikes</a>, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/cannondale-topstone-alloy-2-review/\">Cannondale Topstone</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tailfin claims the V-Mount rubber grips won’t damage your frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tailfin</i></span></div>\n<p>There is no need to purchase a specific bolt-mount variant because all Top Tube Packs enable you to thread a bolt through the V-Mount.</p>\n<p>Tailfin says it has done extensive research and body mapping to combat knee rub, and decided offering different sizes of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bikepacking-bags/\">bikepacking bag</a> was the best solution for riders.</p>\n<p>The packs feature three-dimensional tapering to prevent interference, and Tailfin claims you would hardly know the bag was there.</p>\n<h2>Grav-ero</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Tailfin Top Tube Packs sit behind the stem and out of the wind.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tailfin</i></span></div>\n<p>Tailfin says the Top Tube Packs feature an aerodynamic design, with the teardrop shape sitting neatly behind the stem, similar to the petrol tank of a motorcycle.</p>\n<p>The Flip Lid design features a patented Mag-Lock closing system, combining a magnet and a mechanical lock. Tailfin says an integrated Cord-Lock adds stretch and prevents overstuffing, which could interfere with the packs’ closure.</p>\n<p>According to the brand, both packs are constructed out of welded ripstop nylon, with the Zip model featuring waterproof zips to keep the elements out.</p>\n<h2>Tailfin sizes and pricing</h2>\n<h3>Tailfin Top Tube Pack Zip</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tailfin says the packs are sturdy enough for mountain biking.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>0.8-litre Zip:</strong> £52 / $65 / €60</li>\n<li><strong>1.1-litre Zip:</strong> £55 /$70 / €65</li>\n<li><strong>1.5-litre Zip:</strong> £60 / $75 / €70</li>\n</ul><h3>Tailfin Top Tube Pack Flip</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Flip model closes using a magnet and a mechanical clasp.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tailfin</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>1.1-litre Flip:</strong> £60 / $75 / €70</li>\n<li><strong>1.5-litre Flip:</strong> £65 / $80 / €75</li>\n</ul><p> </p>","author":"Nick Clark","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"c978681f0c16aa04140d0f1dfede42e3b80b0447ce60c114bde4487529ba4ffb","category":"Cycling"}
