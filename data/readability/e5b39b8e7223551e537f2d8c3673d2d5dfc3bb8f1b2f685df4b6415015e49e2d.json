And you never have to get sweaty again, pumping up your tires just before a ride. Developed to replace your regular floor pump, this small self-contained battery-powered compressor is small enough that it can head to the trailhead with you, yet powerful enough to inflate road or mountain bike tires at home. It even packs enough juice to air up more the eight tires from flat on a single charge.</p><h2>Fix Mfg Eflator portable battery-powered tire pump</h2><div><p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/558348730?h=9705237de3\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p>Fix’s rechargeable battery-powered Eflator electric tire pump is small enough to fit in your hand – it’s just 3.5″wide, 1.9″ thick &amp; 5.4″ tall not counting its air hose (9x5x14cm). It’s not meant to replace the mini-pump you carry on a ride, but your much bigger floor pump. The whole idea is to “forever change your ride prep game”.</p><p>You just set your ideal pressure on the built-in digital gauge (from 4 inflation preset targets: 9/30/32/36psi), thread it onto your valve, and it inflates your tire to the perfect pressure hands-free. Easy-peasy.</p><h3>Tech details</h3><div id=\"attachment_278650\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114833/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_Shrader.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-278650\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114833/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_Shrader.jpg\" alt=\"Fix Mfg Eflator portable battery-powered digital tire pump,&nbsp; mini air compressor,&nbsp;Shrader\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114833/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_Shrader.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114833/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_Shrader-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114833/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_Shrader-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114833/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_Shrader-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114833/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_Shrader-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114833/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_Shrader-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-278650\">c. Fix Mfg</p></div><p>The Eflator is powered by a 2000mAh internal battery, recharged via standard USB-C cable included. Fix Mfg says that’s enough power to inflate 9 typical mountain bike tires from flat up to 30psi, or 8 road tires up to 100psi. They aren’t exactly clear how high tire pressure it can go, but do rate the mini air compressor tire pump up to 100+psi, good enough for any modern road tires in my mind. No word on how much it weighs, but we’d guess it’s more than half a kilo, meaning you likely won’t carry it in your CamelBak.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114830/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_details.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114830/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_details.jpg\" alt=\"Fix Mfg Eflator portable battery-powered digital tire pump,&nbsp; mini air compressor,&nbsp;tech details\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114830/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_details.jpg 1000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114830/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_details-297x178.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114830/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_details-800x480.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114830/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_details-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114830/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_details-768x461.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></a></p><p>The pump can be set to display tire pressure in psi, kPa, bar, or kg/cm2 on its large display. It works with Schrader valves, but also includes a thread on Presta adapter and a small carrying bag to keep it all tidy. It even builds-in a small LED flashlight so you can easily inflate tires in the dark.</p><h3>Fix Mfg Eflator portable compressor – Pricing &amp; availability</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114828/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_contents.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114828/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_contents.jpg\" alt=\"Fix Mfg Eflator portable battery-powered digital tire pump,&nbsp; mini air compressor,&nbsp;contents\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114828/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_contents.jpg 900w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114828/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_contents-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114828/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_contents-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114828/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_contents-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17114828/Fix-Mfg-Eflator-portable-battery-powered-digital-tire-pump-mini-air-compressor_contents-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\"></a></p><p>The Fix Mfg Eflator digital pump isn’t the first portable battery-powered <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=compressor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tire pump / air compressor</a> we’ve seen, but at $90 it is surprisingly affordable.
