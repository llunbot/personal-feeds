{"title":"Deals: Nomad's New Sitewide Sale Has 20% Off iPhone 13 Cases, iPad Folios, and More","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/03/deals-nomads-new-sitewide/","date":1635946315000,"content":"<a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-14535369?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2F\">Nomad</a> today kicked off a new sale that is taking <strong>20 percent off</strong> most full-priced products across Nomad's entire website, using the code <strong>SAVE20</strong>. This sitewide sale will last for two days.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/nomad-20-percent-off-sale.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Nomad. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you haven't shopped on Nomad before, the company is well-known for selling high-quality products that protect and accessorize the iPhone, iPad, AirPods, AirPods Pro, and Apple Watch. Nomad also sells Lightning and USB-C cables, leather wallets, keychains, and more. Our code is compatible with most of Nomad's full-priced products, but won't work with new releases like the Base Station Mini.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-14535369?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>20% OFF</div>Nomad Sitewide Sale</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBelow we've rounded up a small collection of Nomad products that you can purchase at a discount this week, but remember that the new code applies to Nomad's entire website. When you're shopping, just use the code <strong>SAVE20</strong> on full-priced items and not on anything already marked down.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNomad also noted that due to supply chain issues, some of their products are seeing delayed shipping estimates ahead of the holidays. Because of this you may see backordered dates on some accessories, so if you're interested in anything this week's 20 percent off sale is a great time to lock in savings and ensure delivery before the holidays.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-14535369?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-case-airpods-wireless-rustic-brown\">AirPods Rugged Case</a> - $27.96, down from $34.95</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-14527713?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fmodern-leather-case-horween-rustic-brown-iphone-13-pro-max\">iPhone 13 Series Modern Leather Case</a> - $47.96, down from $59.95</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-462641-14527713?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fsport-case-marine-blue-iphone-13-pro-max\">iPhone 13 Series Sport Case</a> - $31.96, down from $39.95</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-14535369?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-case-horween-leather-black-ipad-pro-12-9-inch-4th-generation\">12.9-inch iPad Pro Rugged Case</a> - $95.96, down from $119.95</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-14535369?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-folio-horween-leather-rustic-brown-ipad-pro-11-inch-2nd-generation\">11-inch iPad Pro Rugged Folio</a> - $119.96, down from $149.95</li></ul> Head to our full <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Deals Roundup</a> to get caught up with all of the latest deals and discounts that we've been tracking over the past week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nomad/\">Nomad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/03/deals-nomads-new-sitewide/\">Deals: Nomad's New Sitewide Sale Has 20% Off iPhone 13 Cases, iPad Folios, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/deals-nomads-new-sitewide-sale-has-20-off-iphone-13-cases-ipad-folios-and-more.2321566/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=uPRBnGxyTCs:VD6QV9Th9bo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=uPRBnGxyTCs:VD6QV9Th9bo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/uPRBnGxyTCs\" />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"267e8668baf2c6cdeccd73ff89891e7073dcb993eb99fcb62a818b1106794ce0","category":"Apple"}
