It's based on the bestselling book series <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murderbot_Diaries\"><em>The Murderbot Diaries</em></a> by Martha Wells. And judging from the trailer, <em>Murderbot</em> looks like it will strike just the right balance between humor and action.</p>\n<p>There are seven books in Wells' series thus far. All are narrated by Murderbot, who is technically owned by a megacorporation but manages to hack and override its governor module. Rather than rising up and killing its former masters, Murderbot just goes about performing its security work, relieving the boredom by watching a lot of entertainment media.</p>\n<p>In the first book, <em>All Systems Red</em>, Murderbot saves a scientific expedition on an alien planet when they are attacked by a giant alien creature. During the ensuing investigation, the cyborg uncovers a plot against the expedition, as well as a second team, by yet another team intent on killing their rivals for some reason. Murderbot joins the humans in foiling those murderous plans but escapes onto a cargo ship at the end rather than give up its hard-earned autonomy.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/a-sec-unit-goes-rogue-in-murderbot-trailer/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/a-sec-unit-goes-rogue-in-murderbot-trailer/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2bc16ec03fecf675de04bb84e257a5312c3266042261054c148759bbb8738f87","category":"Tech"}
