You don’t even have to worry if you’ve used up all your holiday blasting around smooth Mallorcan tarmac or tackling the Alps on two wheels. Thanks to Rouvy, you can still enjoy riding your bike and explore the world – all while getting fitter and having fun – from the comfort of your own home, whatever the weather outside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rouvy indoor cycling app allows you to travel around the globe and ride some of this planet’s most famous, iconic cycling routes. And this is not simply a gamified version of cycling because these routes are real, using immersive high-quality video with augmented reality to bring you as close as possible to roads you’ve always dreamed of riding or routes you’ve ridden before but haven’t got around to revisiting yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you need to do is link the app to your device – this could be a monitor, phone, tablet or Apple TV, as Rouvy runs on Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, iPad and Apple TV devices. Then connect it to a smart bike or your own favourite road bike using a direct-drive or wheel-on interactive trainer, and you’re off!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Iconic cycling routes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rouvy allows you to explore some of the world’s most famous cycling routes. For starters, you can test yourself on stages from the three Grand Tours – the Giro d’Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a España – to get a feel for what it’s like to be a professional cyclist on some of the world’s most challenging climbs and descents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that’s not all, because there are more than 1,300 augmented reality routes, covering more than 15,000km of roads that go up, down and around just like they do outdoors – this is video, remember, not a computer game. Breathtaking examples include California’s Pacific Coast Highway, Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro and South Africa’s wild Kruger National Park.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if you fancy a bit of culture, you can ride around iconic cities including Paris, Vienna, London, Rome and Sydney – and this is just scratching the surface of the incredible locations from all around the world that Rouvy has to offer. Wherever you want to ride, you will find the terrain, gradient and scenery for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with the routes, Rouvy offers plenty of freedom in how you ride. As well as training or just enjoying the ride, you can compete in races in real time, take part in challenges to win prizes and join group rides, which is a great way of either linking up with like-minded cyclists or spending time on the bike with friends even when you’re not together.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-2-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Ride around the world with Rouvy\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-2-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-2-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-2-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Rouvy</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>And you can use Rouvy in multiple ways – you can train on routes that you plan to ride or race in the future or you can visit far-flung locations that maybe you will never get to see in real life. It’s up to you how you want to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way you will enjoy real routes in augmented reality, helping you to enjoy the thrill of cycling the same way you do outside.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gravel adventures</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re not restricted solely to tarmac either, because Rouvy also offers a wide range of gravel routes on which to hone your off-road skills. Highlights include the Sani gravel climb in South Africa, the Schultz Pass Road in Arizona and the Capitol Reef National Park in Utah, but there are many more for you to explore and, as you find your favourites, keep on returning to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel riding has really taken off over the past few years, with manufacturers offering bikes that can blend performance on the road with the ability to explore more challenging terrain off it, thanks to design elements such as relaxed geometry for greater comfort, as well as shock absorption, increased tyre clearance and wider tyres for greater grip and control, and dedicated groupsets designed for tackling steep climbs and uneven paths with loose surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The versatility of the modern gravel bike is reflected in Rouvy’s ability to let you ride on or off-road. You can experience the thrill of technical terrain from your own home – and just like gravel riding when you head outdoors, no one cares what you wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Training tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rouvy isn’t a sightseeing tool (unless you want to simply potter around on it, of course). It offers structured workouts from an extensive library and you can also access training plans from TrainingPeaks. There’s a five-week training plan for beginners if you’re new to cycling or have been off the bike for a while, and the app even offers real-time feedback on your ride effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good example of how versatile this training tool can be comes from Rouvy’s role as Virtual Partner at this year’s Vuelta a España, Spain’s Grand Tour. As well as offering you the opportunity to ride stages from the iconic race, Rouvy produced La Vuelta workouts, challenges and ‘Get Fitter with Andy Schleck’, a training plan with the former Grand Tour-winning pro cyclist.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-3-970x180.jpg\" alt=\"Ride around the world with Rouvy\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-3-970x180.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-3-300x56.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-3-768x143.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-3-750x139.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-3-1140x212.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/rouvy-advertorial-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Rouvy uses immersive high-quality video to transport you to far-flung locations around the globe and take the monotony out of your indoor training rides. </figcaption><figcaption>Rouvy</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Rouvy also includes Strava Live Segments to increase your connection with the outdoor world via Rouvy’s Just Ride mode. On Rouvy, your Segment ride will show up next to two avatars: your best result on the segment (PR) and the fastest rider, the King or Queen of the Mountain (KoM or QoM).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever your level of fitness, Rouvy allows you to set realistic goals, track your progress and challenge yourself against others and your own personal records. And like cycling itself, Rouvy is open to all – you can enjoy the ride whether you’re male or female, old or young, and you have the freedom to do it whenever you want. Fancy riding across San Francisco’s iconic Golden Gate Bridge at 4am? You got it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also worth pointing out that Rouvy isn’t intended to replace your outdoor rides, even in winter – the idea is to help you get fitter and stay motivated to enjoy riding your bike all year round. In fact, the Rouvy app even counts your cycling efforts in the great outdoors towards your Rouvy Career. Talking of which…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rouvy career</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter your age, it’s not too late to embark on a cycling career – not in Rouvy, anyway. And you can even earn rewards from it. The Rouvy Career allows you to measure your progress in two ways: by gaining Experience and by collecting Coins. You earn Experience points for every pedal stroke – indoor, outdoor, races, training rides, even your warm-up and cooldown – and when you level up you will receive a new on-screen badge and prizes from Rouvy’s partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rouvy app performs an initial calibration and then starts calculating each athlete’s individual performance based on real values, such as time, effort, FTP, watts and more. The app adjusts the calculation in proportion to your effort, and the calculation continues to adapt throughout your Rouvy Career to take changes in your fitness into account as you progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also receive Coins every time you complete a route, and these can be used to customise your avatar’s bike frame. You want to look your best when you’re tackling that famous climb, scenic city route or stunning countryside on your cycling world tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get up and riding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting started couldn’t be easier. All you have to do is visit rouvy.com to create an account, then download the Rouvy app and sync it with your trainer – whether that’s a smart bike, direct driver or classic trainer, Rouvy has you covered. And let’s face it, that’s a lot more time- and cost-effective than putting this magazine to one side (once you’ve finished reading it, of course), choosing a cycling holiday and boxing up your bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sign up and before you know it you can be riding wherever in the world you choose – it may even help you find inspiration for that next race, cycling holiday or off-road bikepacking adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to find out more?
