{"title":"Shocker: ByteDance Still Receives Data From U.S. TikTok Users","link":"https://fortune.com/2024/04/15/tiktok-china-data-sharing-bytedance-project-texas/?showAdminBar=true","date":1713209334000,"content":"\n<p>Alexandra Sternlicht, reporting for Fortune (<a href=\"https://apple.news/AQGXXco6eSvqRNMvJrxwEfQ\">News+</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Evan Turner, who worked at TikTok as a senior data scientist from \nApril to September in 2022, said TikTok concealed the involvement \nof its Chinese owner during his employment. When hired, Turner \ninitially reported to a ByteDance executive in Beijing. But later \nthat year, after the company announced a major initiative to store \nTikTok’s U.S. user data only in the U.S., Turner was reassigned — on paper, at least — to an American manager in Seattle, he says. \nBut Turner says a human resources representative revealed during a \nvideo conference call that he would, in reality, continue to work \nwith the ByteDance executive. The stealth chain of command \ncontradicted what TikTok’s executives had said about the company’s \nindependence from ByteDance, Turner says. [...] </p>\n\n<p>Nearly every 14 days, as part of Turner’s job throughout 2022, he \nemailed spreadsheets filled with data for hundreds of thousands of \nU.S. users to ByteDance workers in Beijing. That data included \nnames, email addresses, IP addresses, and geographic and \ndemographic information of TikTok U.S. users, he says. The goal \nwas to sift through the information to mine for insights like the \ngeographical regions where users watched the most videos of a \nparticular genre and decide how the company should invest to \nencourage users to be more active. It all took place after the \ncompany had started its initiative to keep sensitive U.S. user \ndata in the U.S., and only available to U.S. workers. </p>\n\n<p>“I literally worked on a project that gave U.S. data to China,” \nTurner says. “They were completely complicit in that. There were \nAmericans that were working in upper management that were \ncompletely complicit in this.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/packyM/status/1779852605201465655\">Packy McCormick</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s astonishing that we don’t have the political will to simply ban TikTok.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/15/fortune-tiktok-china\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3c93fbde4302265648a542fbfd65b1b1064e5838f5e0a54550d4c527c23e4181","category":"Tech"}
