Even if we did have a full census of all threatening space rocks, we do not have the capabilities to rapidly respond to an Earth-intersecting asteroid (despite the success of NASA’s Double-Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission).</p>\n<p>Some day in the finite future, an object will pose a threat to us—it’s an inevitability of life in our Solar System. The good news is that it’s not too late to do something about it. But it will take some work.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021515#p3\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021515&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Paul Sutter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"973b09418236bc00684a383540d0a409c0cfa1e83e215750bf0cf36c0e1c1015","category":"Tech"}
