Sales of traditional mouse-and-keyboard computers have been falling for years, replaced by mobile phones and tablets.</p>\n\n<p>Conventional computers now sport touchscreens and otherwise blur the lines between device types – and between mobile and desktop operating systems. Mobile and touch are <strong>the new computing normal</strong>, but there is a lot of myth, rumor, error, bias, and out-of-date information on how portable touchscreens are used.</p>\n\n<p><em>Touch Design for Mobile Interfaces</em> presents and shares real information on hardware, people, interactions, and environments. Steven Hoober has studied <strong>how people really touch and hold</strong> phones and tablets, as well as seeing it firsthand over twenty years designing products for mobile phones, tablets, kiosks, and computers.</p>\n\n<p>As well as Steven’s in-depth research, the book includes tips, tricks, trends, tendencies, guidelines, and heuristics you can apply to your own designs immediately.</p>\n\n<p><em>400 pages.

If you want to design better for mobile, or you need data to back up your decisions, this book is evidence-based, specific, and full of actionable information. If you want to move from desktop design to mobile, the book provides a path for you to reconsider design decisions for touch and mobility.</p>\n\n<p>There are benefits too for <strong>product designers, managers, and analysts, as well as developers and engineers on mobile touchscreen products</strong>. You’ll be able to plan for the new <em>touch-also</em> world, write better stories and features, and understand how the work environment has moved from predictable computers in cubicles to devices everywhere, anywhere, and anytime.</p>\n\nTable Of Contents\n<p>How do people really use their mobile devices?

Steven synthesizes his extensive field observations with a deep technical understanding of touch usage and history. This book balances pragmatic guidelines and theory in a way that’s accessible, memorable, and highly referenceable.
