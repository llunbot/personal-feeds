Every week brings the promise of new and exciting models, products, and tools. Itâ€™s easy to get swept up in the waves of hype, but these shiny capabilities come at a real cost to society and the planet.</p>\n<p>Downsides include the environmental toll of mining rare minerals, the human costs of the labor-intensive process of data annotation, and the escalating financial investment required to train AI models as they incorporate more parameters.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929528#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929528&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d6eb61ca3086c03e441bdf3bc7b0e39bd6d7a1830b0735c728ca994fb1b1981d","category":"Tech"}
