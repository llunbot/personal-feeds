You typically need to bore holes in your wall. And when it comes to stability, you either have to bet on your own skills or have a handier person enter your home (and, possibly, pay them). The upcoming Displace TV seeks to address these concerns with a nail-less, hole-less mounting system that allows the 55-inch screen to zip-line down to foam-padded safety if mount security is jeopardized.</p>\n<p>Displace, a startup founded in 2022, announced the Displace TV at the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/the-7-most-interesting-pc-monitors-from-ces-2023/\">CES 2023</a> trade show in January. The TV is 4K OLED and wireless, meaning it has no power cord or ports. Similar to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/lgs-wireless-ish-oled-tvs-start-at-7000/\">LG's OLED M TVs</a>, it gets its content from what Displace calls a \"base control unit\" computer placed near the television.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/displace-tv.jpg\"><img alt=\"Displace is still finalizing the design of its TV's integrated and removable battery packs.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/displace-tv-640x425.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/displace-tv-1280x851.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/displace-tv.jpg\">Displace is still finalizing the design of its TV's integrated and removable battery packs.</a> (credit: Displace)</p></div>\n<p>This week, Displace demoed new \"safety features\" for the TV made in response to concerns about the device's proprietary \"active-loop vacuum technology.\" The vacuum tech is supposed to securely adhere the TV to painted, ceramic, or glass walls without holes, nails, or other tools. But it relies on TV battery power.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973580#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973580&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9a742a4e5b00c4821f409bdbfff6576148f4b07335c011f4658de1c13ae6198e","category":"Tech"}
