He’s become synonymous with the team’s Specialized bikes and has proudly displayed his sponsors in more victory salutes than we can count. After his successful stint with the German outfit, it’s time for a new chapter in the Slovakian rider’s career, could this be exactly what he needs to return to the dominance of old?</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>Sagan will always be considered one of the sport’s greatest talents, he made history in modern cycling by winning the world championships three years in a row, this is among 12 Tour de France stage wins and 7 victories in the green jersey competition. In his most successful years, you would rarely count the BORA rider out if he came towards the line in the right position. He can perform on a plethora of terrain, taking victories in bunch sprints, in the Classics and excelling in any sort of rolling ground in between.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/paris-roubaix-2021-preview\">Related: Paris Roubaix 2021 Preview</a></em></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/IMG_9754_1024x1024.jpg?v=1627981969\" /><em>Sagan wins 2017 Road World Championships, image: Christopher Lanaway/SWpix</em></p>\n\n<p><span><span>His wins in the points classification at the Tour de France highlight this versatility: no other competition rewards riders more for mixing mass-sprint podiums with intermediate sprints on hilly parcour. With first place in Paris-Roubaix, Flanders and Gent Wevelgem, there’s little more that the Slovakian national champion could add to his palmares.</span></span></p>\n<p><span>Sagan’s physical ability is one thing, but part of what makes his entry into the top of the sport so memorable was the style and attitude he brought with him. Hailed as “cycling’s saviour” by none other than Bradley Wiggins, Sagan provided entertainment for the masses at a time when cycling especially needed it, awash with drama about Team Sky’s TUE scandals. Peter Sagan became cycling’s rockstar, his relaxed demeanour and casual reaction to his success making him all the more likable. Often celebrating with bunny-hops and wheelies, his wins added a new flavour to the sport as it was rapidly in danger of turning sour.</span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20160325__BrakeThrough-Media_AX7O4441_1024x1024.jpg?v=1627983221\" /><em>Image: BrakeThrough Media</em></p>\n<p>The Slovakian possesses incredible technical skills, helped by his grounding in mountain biking. Many of his wins in earlier years came in part from his supreme descending prowess, it was the kind of riding that gave those of us watching at home sweaty palms and no doubt spooked the riders on his wheel. In his first Grand Tour appearance, the Vuelta a Espana in 2011, Sagan won three stages, causing a split on the final descent in stage 6 by putting himself in the most aerodynamic tuck possible, and taking some fierce lines around the corners. Behind, most of the peloton could only watch on, in awe of this superstar mountain-biker that was breaking all the rules on the road racing scene.</p>\n<p><span>But such dominance has to come to an end eventually, and it could be said that Sagan’s ended after the 2019 season. He’d won the green jersey at the Tour that year, and secured a stage win, as well as finishing 4th in Milan Sanremo. In 2020, though, he took just one win: the Giro d’Italia stage 10, finishing solo, 19 seconds ahead of the rider in second place.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>By most standards, a win in a Giro stage would complete an entire season. Victory in a Grand Tour is supremely difficult and could secure a contract for the next year and beyond. Plus, Sagan had multiple top 10 finishes in previous races, an indication that he was still in his usual strong form. However, once you have the track record he does, it becomes increasingly difficult to not hold Sagan to a higher standard. A win at the Giro is, of course, a commendable result, but the Slovakian’s unmatched past successes have made things hard for him. He’ll constantly be compared to those golden days.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/CorVos-SWpix.com1834_1024x1024.jpg?v=1627982201\" /><em>Sagan wins Giro d'Italia 2021 stage 10, image: CorVos/SWpix.com</em></span></p>\n<p><span></span><span>This season so far, Sagan has won a stage at the Giro and had 6 top 5 finishes in Grand Tour stages. He’s still up there with the best, fighting at the finish, but the top step so often alludes him. It could be argued that with some more organisation from BORA Hansgrohe, some of these podiums could have been first place. Ide Schelling, for example, rode emphatically for polka dot jersey points at the Tour – a commendable assault of the race in his first attempt – but he is an example of a valuable rider who might have helped position Sagan for the sprint finales. Instead, his energy was used scrapping for mountain points that gave little reward in the end.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/polka-dot-duel-ide-schelling-s-impressive-start-to-le-tour\">Related: Polka dot duel, Ide Schelling's Tour debut</a></em></strong></p>\n<p><span>BORA have often been seen investing in GC talents rather than building a team around Sagan who might have been able to help him in the Classics, races well-suited to his strengths. The three-time world champion leaves the team on good terms, though, so we’re told. \"Change is part of life,\" Sagan said when announcing his departure. \"We have come to the conclusion that it is better to start a new chapter.\"</span></p>\n<p><span>Could it be that a change to a new team is exactly what Sagan needs to return to the success of his previous seasons? Seasons where the norm was ten wins on the WorldTour stage each year, rather than one. He clearly still has the strength to be there in the finals, and he certainly has the tactical ability. The missing pieces of the puzzle might be a team which will fully support him, a fresh start and a new motivation.</span><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Sagan___Kolln-_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1627981936\" /></span><em>Image: </em><em>Timm Kölln</em></p>\n\n<p><span><span>Rumours are that he could head to Patrick Levefere’s Deceuninck Quick-Step, a team which has a history of bringing riders back to their best, just look at the resurgent Mark Cavendish they've brought into 2021. More likely, though, is that Sagan will end up at Team Total Direct Energie, a French team who would like to take a step up the professional ranking.</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/mark-cavendishs-transcendent-win\">Related: Mark Cavendish's transcendent wins</a></em></strong></p>\n<p><span>Sagan won’t be the easiest rider to sign, however. He will most probably hope to take his brother and teammate, Juraj Sagan, with him to whichever team is the highest bidder, plus some of his most trusted domestiques. It was reported that the Slovakian commanded one of the biggest salaries in the WorldTour at BORA Hansgrohe, along with his significant entourage of staff and riders. Any team that wants the sevenfold green jersey winner will need the budget to go with it.</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s difficult to say if Sagan will win big again with whichever team he ends up riding for, or if this will mark the steady path to retirement. Either way, he has made a lasting impact as one of the most influential riders in cycling history. His engagement with fans and maverick racing style made many people fall in love with racing once more when the sport was descending into a dark place. He can only look back on his time with BORA Hansgrohe with positive thoughts, he revolutionised the sport when riding for the team.</span></p>\n<p><span>We'll eagerly wait and see what comes next for Sagan. Will his next move be the closing chapter, or the start of an entirely new story?</span></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Miles Baker-Clarke","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"15d539024b7f26dbe1af0eba06ca5a5061dd1046d4eca813a46f488bbb5761b8","category":"Cycling"}
