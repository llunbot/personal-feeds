At its peak, Skype had more than 300 million monthly active users and was synonymous with internet-based voice and video calling. For many, Skype was their first experience of speaking to someone halfway across the world for free, a radical shift from the dominance of telcos and expensive long-distance calls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe service steadily declined in relevance in recent years, with its active user base shrinking to approximately 36 million by 2023 as competitors such as Zoom, WhatsApp, and Microsoft's own Teams platform gained traction.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTeams has since grown to 320 million monthly users, far surpassing Skype's remaining user base. The company's decision to discontinue Skype is apparently part of a broader effort to prioritize artificial intelligence features within Teams. Employees who worked on Skype will be reassigned to other projects rather than being laid off.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSkype played a key role in popularizing VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technology, enabling businesses and individuals to connect around the world with minimal costs. It also served as an early testbed for AI-powered real-time language translation, a feature Microsoft showcased in a widely publicized demonstration in 2014. However, its frequent UI changes, reliability issues, ill-conceived social media-like features, gradual shift toward enterprise, and inability to keep pace with newer competitors, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, ultimately led to its obsolescence. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nExisting Skype users had until May 5 to migrate their data and contacts to Teams or seek alternative solutions. Skype's legacy lives on in the VoIP technology it helped to normalizeâ€”but as a product, it stands as a case study in how brand recognition alone can't save a stagnant platform.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/skype/\">Skype</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/skype-shuts-down/\">Skype Shuts Down After 22 Years, Ending an Era of Internet Calling</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/skype-shuts-down-after-22-years-ending-an-era-of-internet-calling.2456587/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"db747e9a184ddc80683381cb90a96d8cacac0e67f05a72969be951d64e11515d","category":"Apple"}
