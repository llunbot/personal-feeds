If you ride off-road, we’ve got a separate article on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-waterproof-jackets-for-mountain-biking/\">best mountain biking jackets</a>.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, you’ll find BikeRadar’s top-rated jackets below – or skip to the end for our buyer’s guide on choosing the right jacket for your needs.</p>\n<p>For more advice on kitting yourself out for bad weather, we’ve got guides to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-winter-cycling-shoes/\">best winter cycling shoes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-overshoes/\">best overshoes</a> to keep your feet warm and dry, plus a round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-winter-cycling-gloves/\">best winter cycling gloves</a>.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>Best waterproof cycling jackets in 2021</h2>\n<ul><li><span>Castelli Idro Pro 2: </span>£340 / $400 / €350</li>\n<li><strong>Endura Pro SL Shell Jacket II:</strong> £165 / $225 / €200</li>\n<li><span>Gore C5 Shakedry 1985 Viz:</span> £250 / $300 / AU$360</li>\n<li><strong>Assos Equipe RS Schlosshund: </strong>£290 / $369 / €209</li>\n<li><strong>Castelli Idro 2:</strong> £300 / $300 / €270</li>\n<li><strong>Gore-Tex Paclite:</strong> £170</li>\n<li><strong>Lusso Aqua Pro Extreme:</strong> £165 / $215 / €197 / AU$325</li>\n<li><strong>Madison Apex Waterproof Storm Jacket:</strong> £135</li>\n<li><strong>R</strong><b>apha Pro Team Lightweight Gore-Tex Shakedry:</b> £220 / $295 / €260</li>\n<li><strong>Santini Guard Nimbus</strong>: £149</li>\n<li><strong>Van Rysel RCR Ultralight Packable Showerproof: </strong>£45 / €25</li>\n<li><strong>Albion Rain Jacket 2.0:</strong> £175</li>\n<li><strong>Altura Firestorm Waterproof:</strong> £80 / €100</li>\n<li><strong>Ashmei Waterproof Jacket</strong>: £238 / $200 / AU$258 / €172</li>\n<li><strong>Decathlon Triban RC500 Rainproof:</strong> £40 / €50</li>\n<li><strong>dhb Aeron Rain Defence Polartec:</strong> £130 / $180 / €160</li>\n<li><strong>Madison Peloton:</strong> £90</li>\n<li><span>Métier Beacon:</span> £250</li>\n<li><strong>Q36.5 R.Shell:</strong> £300 / €249</li>\n<li><strong>Rapha Commuter:</strong> £100 / $135 / AU$175</li>\n<li><strong>Santini Vega Multi Jacket:</strong> £220 / $322 / €240</li>\n</ul><p><em>All RRPs refer to the price when the jacket was originally tested by BikeRadar.</em></p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Castelli Idro Pro 2</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cut from Gore’s Shakedry material, the Idro Pro 2 is windproof, waterproof and highly breathable.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><span>£340 / $400 / €350 as tested</span></li>\n<li><span>Rear pockets</span></li>\n<li><span>Mix of Gore fabrics for skin-tight fit</span></li>\n<li><span>Weighs 185g</span></li>\n</ul><p><span>Hitting five stars in a face-off of 10 waterproof shell jackets, the Idro Pro 2 has a racer’s cut and is made of Gore Shakedry fabric tempered by panels of equally waterproof Gore Topo to add stretch at the sides, shoulders, elbows and wrists, for a skin-tight fit. </span></p>\n<p><span>Unlike many waterproof jackets, the Idro Pro has a decent run of pockets, complete with drainage holes.

However, we’re now seeing the rise of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-rise-of-the-jerket-where-does-a-jersey-stop-and-a-jacket-begin/\" target=\"_blank\">‘jerket’ or rain jersey</a>.</p>\n<p>These are softshell tops that feel like a jersey but use a waterproof membrane or DWR  (durable water repellent) treatment to repel precipitation.</p>\n<p>Things would be easier if it were simply a matter of keeping the rain out, but pedalling makes you hot and sweaty, and the heat and moisture you generate need an escape route.</p>\n<p>The trouble is, the properties that allow a waterproof jacket to keep the rain off also make it difficult to deal with the damp building up on the inside.</p>\n<p>The ideal solution, therefore, is a cycling jacket that combines being waterproof with breathability, which is difficult, but by no means impossible. Some garments manage it by using advanced materials, others solve the problem by incorporating vents into their designs.</p>\n<p>Aside from being waterproof and breathable, it’s worth seeking out a jacket that packs down into a tiny package that’s easy to stow. Better still, if the rain stops, you can take it off and put it away rather than keep wearing it long after it’s done its job.</p>\n<h2>How waterproof fabrics work</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> GoreTex, eVent and Windstopper membranes all use a similar construction.</span></figcaption><span> <i>GoreTex</i></span></div>\n<p>Waterproof fabrics are either multi-layer laminate fabrics or regular woven fabrics that get a DWR treatment designed to keep water out. While both achieve the same goal, they work slightly differently.</p>\n<h3>DWR</h3>\n<p>Durable water repellent, or DWR, is your wet weather gear’s first line of defence. It’s not a laminate or coating but a treatment applied to the fabric’s outer surface.</p>\n<p>All waterproof garments, except those where the membrane is the outermost surface, receive a DWR finish.</p>\n<p>The treatment does not inhibit breathability because it doesn’t fill the gaps between the fibres. Instead, it bonds the individual fibres to help the garment shed water and prevent saturation.</p>\n<p>DWR treatments shed water because they increase the contact angle of moisture on a fabric by forcing a water droplet to maintain its surface tension; so when you see water beading on a fabric, the DWR is hard at work.</p>\n<p>When the DWR is applied to a fabric, it creates micropegs or microspikes that protrude from the fibres and prevent water from spreading out, forcing it to form beads that slide off the fabric without seeping in.</p>\n<p>However, DWR treatments wear off over time, accelerated by abrasions and some detergents. When this happens, the fabric no longer causes water to bead and will become saturated and heavy.</p>\n<p>Not to fear, though, refreshing and retreating a garment is simple and there are plenty of spray-on or wash-in options available. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/gear/article/how-to-rejuvenate-your-waterproof-cycling-gear-39469/\">Check out our guide on how to rejuvenate your waterproof cycling gear</a>.</p>\n<h3>Laminate fabrics</h3>\n<p>Most waterproof breathable fabrics are made from laminate materials, which usually consist of an inner fabric optimised for wicking moisture, a waterproof membrane and an outer-face fabric with a DWR treatment.</p>\n<p>Gore-Tex, Thinsulate, Polartec and eVent are all internal membranes that are sandwiched between two other materials – usually something abrasion-resistant on the outside, with a soft liner on the inside. Even the <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/gear/category/clothing/jerseys/product/review-castelli-gabba-rain-jersey-12-45600/\">Castelli Gabba Jersey</a> is made using a Windstopper laminate fabric.</p>\n<p>The reason these lamination techniques allow for water-repellent characteristics is that the inner membranes are full of holes. This may seem counterintuitive, but a Gore-Tex membrane boasts nine billion pores, each 1µm – a millionth of a metre – wide per square inch. The holes are big enough to allow water vapour created by sweat evaporation to escape, but are too small for water droplets to sneak through.</p>\n<p>These internal membranes are quite fragile, which is why there’s an abrasion-resistant layer on the outside of the garment. This outer layer receives DWR treatment and, as we mentioned before, the problem with DWR treatments is they eventually wash away, causing a jacket to ‘wet-out’, meaning the moisture escaping from inside and landing on the outside saturates the outer fabric, clogging the pores of the membrane and eliminating breathability.</p>\n<p>When a jacket stops breathing, the moisture your body creates gets trapped inside, creating that unpleasant, steaming-hot sensation.</p>\n<p>Most outerwear today is based on this two and a half- or three-layer lamination, but the fabrics and membranes are continuing to evolve and we’re now seeing jackets eliminating the outer fabric.</p>\n<p>Pioneered by Columbia with its OutDry fabric, brands have figured out how to toughen up these membranes and eliminated the DWR-treated outer fabric.</p>\n<p>This construction is becoming the go-to for high-end, cycling-specific jackets, with several big-name brands using versions from GoreTex – the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/jackets-and-vests/jackets/gore-one-gore-tex-active-bike-jacket-review/\" target=\"_blank\">One Active</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-gore-tex-shakedry-cycling-rain-jackets/\" target=\"_blank\">Shakedry</a> fabrics allow the membrane to be used as an outer ‘beading surface’.</p>\n<p>The advantages of these fabrics are that they can’t wet out because there is no face fabric to saturate, they weigh next to nothing and breathe better too.</p>\n<h2>What to look for when buying a waterproof cycling jacket</h2>\n<h3>Waterproofing</h3>\n<p>To be officially waterproof, a garment has to withstand the pressure of 1,000mm of water without leaking. This test concentrates on jackets that keep moisture managed so you stay warm however foul the forecast.</p>\n<p>Usually, this is achieved through an internal membrane like those from Gore-Tex and eVent.</p>\n<p>Waterproofness is generally measured in terms of how much water, in mm, can be placed on top of a fabric in a column until it seeps through (though some companies dispute whether this testing method accurately represents real-world conditions). In simple terms, bigger numbers ought to mean the garment’s fabric can withstand more water before any leakage occurs.</p>\n<p>However, as with anything, the raw numbers don’t always tell the full story. How a jacket is constructed plays a big role too, because water can also get in through poorly sealed seams or zips, or via the collar or sleeves if they don’t fit correctly.</p>\n<h3>Breathability</h3>\n<p>It’s no good keeping rain out if you get soaked by sweat from within. Different fabrics have different water vapour transfer rates but cut, lining, membranes and vents all make a significant difference to how dry you stay.</p>\n<h3>Taping</h3>\n<p>Taping is used to seal the seams in a waterproof jacket on the inside. It does add bulk and reduce a jacket’s breathability, so some of the jackets in this list trade a bit of seam leakage for better overall performance.</p>\n<h3>Care</h3>\n<p>The worst enemy of your wet-weather gear is your washing machine. Detergents (biological ones especially) strip off waterproof coatings and conditioners clog the pores and fibres that help fabric wick and breathe.</p>\n<p>Still, it’s important to keep waterproof fabrics clean because dirt and oil can clog membranes (limiting the fabric’s ability to breathe) and degrade DWR treatments, too. Always read washing instructions carefully.</p>\n<p>Often overlooked is the outer DWR treatment. If your jacket is wetting out as described above, there are ways to revive the treatment on your jacket.</p>\n<p>Some manufacturers say to throw the garment in the tumble dryer for a few minutes on low to medium heat, others recommend ‘touch ups’ with an iron on the warm setting. Again, refer to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>\n<p>Finally, if the existing DWR treatment can’t be saved you can re-treat it. There are quite a few spray-on and wash-in products available from brands such as Grangers and Nikwax. Again, follow the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>Pockets, hoods and zippered vents might seem like a good idea on a hanger, but not if they make a jacket too bulky to shove in your back pocket. Extra features all add to the cost too.</p>\n<p>That said, features such as a dropped tail can protect your rear from road spray if you don’t have mudguards, and reflective details can help keep you visible in low light, so consider which features you actually need for the type of riding you do.</p>\n<h3>Visibility</h3>\n<p>There’s currently no requirement (in the UK at least) for cyclists to wear high-visibility clothing at any time of day or night (<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lights-for-road-cycling/\" target=\"_blank\">front and rear lights</a> are a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-light-laws-in-the-uk-what-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">legal requirement</a> in the UK at night, though), but for some it’s an important consideration.</p>\n<p>Whatever your opinion on the subject, it’s always <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bend-in-the-road-light-em-up/\" target=\"_blank\">good to have choice</a> and hi-vis doesn’t have to mean fluorescent yellow anymore. Though it was once the case that the majority of waterproof cycling jackets were either clear, black or designed to look like building site safety equipment, many brands now offer waterproof jackets in a variety of bright, dare we say even fashionable, colours.</p>","author":"Simon von Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"de754158d85f4be802cb8a2d75c346335ef56cf6921ee85e97d0ee8aa6bc802f","category":"Cycling"}
