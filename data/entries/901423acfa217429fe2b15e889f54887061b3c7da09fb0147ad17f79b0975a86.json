Been there. But this quirky, lesser-known app is actually helping people stick with it. And, at under $1 per course, it’s kind of wild that more people aren’t talking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/qlango-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-1355&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=qlango-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages-25-04-17&amp;utm_term=SALE-327879\" target=\"_blank\">Qlango language learning</a> takes a relaxed, game-filled approach. Think word puzzles and trivia designed to make new vocabulary stick by showing you terms in real-world scenarios. Unlike apps that let you move on too quickly, Qlango revisits words again and again until you truly master them. Plus, if you get stuck, it offers hints — so there’s no need to stress when you come to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another win? Qlango offers lessons in a whopping 56 languages. You’ll find lessons in popular tongues like Italian, German, and Spanish, but also some that cater to smaller groups like Icelandic, Macedonian, Armenian, Latin, and Georgian. Whether you want to work toward fluency in one or learn greetings in as many as you can, this app is one of the most unique ways to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get your <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/qlango-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-1355&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=qlango-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages-25-04-17&amp;utm_term=SALE-327879\" target=\"_blank\">Qlango lifetime subscription</a> here for only $39.99 (reg. $119.99).</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp1.stackassets.com/ef6e4cc183fb423b58bad9b3e417303cc31cdbf6/store/1e486bc39fa10c1dba22e83167af520ed8dab7977957a15970ed1e6fd185/sale_327879_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Qlango Language Learning: Lifetime Subscription (All Languages)<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/qlango-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-1355&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=qlango-language-learning-lifetime-subscription-all-languages-2025-04-21&amp;utm_term=SALE-327879\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com/?utm_content=PS-1355&amp;utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=Referral\"><em>StackSocial</em></a><em> prices subject to change.</em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"901423acfa217429fe2b15e889f54887061b3c7da09fb0147ad17f79b0975a86","category":"Apple"}
