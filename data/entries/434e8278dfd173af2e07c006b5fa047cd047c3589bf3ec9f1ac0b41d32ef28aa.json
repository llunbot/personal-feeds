{"title":"Hey Calendar","link":"https://hey.com/","date":1705793220000,"content":"\n<p>My thanks to Hey for sponsoring this week at DF to promote their new Hey Calendar. </p>\n\n<p>Back in 2020 Hey launched their email service with a completely fresh take on a category that hadn’t seen anything new in forever. I’ve been subscribed since it launched, and still find it like nothing else. Their “screener” feature alone is worth it: get an email from someone you never want to see email from again? Just screen them out with a single thumbs-down button click. Those emails aren’t trashed, and they aren’t flagged as spam — they’re screened out of your inbox (or in Hey’s terms, <em>imbox</em>), but they remain in a “Screened Out” mailbox just in case. Every email app should have something like this.</p>\n\n<p>Now they’ve done the same with calendaring. The all-new Hey Calendar brings flexibility, personality, and a radical new point of view to the boring old grid of dates.</p>\n\n<p>So Hey is now both email and a calendar, all-in-one. As you <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/09/hey-calendar-now-in-app-store\">may have heard</a>, they’ve got an all-new mobile app for Hey Calendar. too.
