Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-debuts-m4-chip/\">already debuted the M4 chip</a> in the iPad Pro earlier this year, but it has yet to announce the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/apple-potentially-facing-worst-leak-since-iphone-4/\">seemingly already leaked in Russia</a> in recent weeks, and those leaks revealed that the MacBook Pro lineup might finally start with 16GB of RAM instead of 8GB. The leaked 14-inch MacBook Pro has no major external design changes, but it does appear to have an additional, third Thunderbolt 4 port compared to the current entry-level model with two Thunderbolt 3 ports.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is currently not entirely clear if Apple plans to announce the first Macs with M4 chips at a virtual event this month, or with press releases only. Yesterday, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/apple-unveils-new-ipad-mini-apple-intelligence/\">announced a new iPad mini</a> with Apple Intelligence support in a press release.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn any case, it appears that new Macs are just around the corner.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/16/m4-macbook-pro-supply-chain-report/\">Apple's Supply Chain Gears Up for MacBook Pro Models With M4 Chips</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-supply-chain-gears-up-for-macbook-pro-models-with-m4-chips.2440224/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e58b74c474f52b1f22a577076d3fb7d245dfe3893950ef881dba652df4ec24cc","category":"Apple"}
