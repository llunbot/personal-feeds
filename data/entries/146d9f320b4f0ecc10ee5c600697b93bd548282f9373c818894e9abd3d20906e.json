The emulator is already one of the top free apps on the App Store charts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iGBA-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt was not entirely clear if Apple would allow emulators to work with all and any games, but iGBA is able to load any Game Boy ROMs that users download from the web and open via the Files app on the iPhone. Accordingly, it seems like there are no game restrictions for emulators, unless Apple mistakenly approved iGBA on the App Store.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niGBA works with Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games. It is important to note that it can be illegal to possess certain ROMs from game developers, but <a href=\"https://hh.gbdev.io/\">homebrew Game Boy games</a> are typically in the clear.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niGBA <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@rileytestut/post/C5u9xdDNCJ2\">appears to be a copy</a> of Riley Testut's <a href=\"https://github.com/CocoaBob/GBA4iOS\">open-source GBA4iOS emulator</a>, but with ads that can track users. GBA4iOS is the predecessor to Testut's current Nintendo game emulator <a href=\"https://faq.deltaemulator.com/\">Delta</a>, which can be installed on the iPhone outside of the App Store, and will soon be available through his <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/01/altstore-eu-iphone-patreon/\">alternative app marketplace AltStore</a> on iPhones in the EU. It is not clear if Testut plans to make Delta available in the App Store following the rule change.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> As noted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomaxwell/status/1779649026524320032\">by Thomas Maxwell</a>, the iGBA emulator has been removed from the App Store. It is unclear if the app was removed by Apple or the developer behind it.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emulator/\">Emulator</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/game-boy-emulator-in-app-store/\">Game Boy Emulator for iPhone Now Available in App Store Following Rule Change [Removed]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/game-boy-emulator-for-iphone-now-available-in-app-store-following-rule-change-removed.2424159/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"146d9f320b4f0ecc10ee5c600697b93bd548282f9373c818894e9abd3d20906e","category":"Apple"}
