Dimming lights is not an option, nor is activating automations, but some of that can be done through scenes. Adding a widget is a useful way to control frequently accessed lights or scenes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong with widgets, the update also improves Friends of Hue switches like the Lutron Aurora Smart Bulb Dimmer Switch. Switches now support time-based light, the scene cycle mode, the natural light scene, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Philips Hue app can be <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/philips-hue/id1055281310\">downloaded from the App Store</a> for free.
