Shimano offers only 40- and 42-tooth rings. Wolf Tooth Component’s Drop Stop ST chainrings increase that substantially, with both round and oval options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WTC’s options range from 36- to 46-tooth, and weights range from 65.5g up to 102g. They use same 110BCD asymmetric 4-bolt mounting pattern and 50mm chainline to match GRX’s specs. Larger 48, 50, and 52 tooth counts are in the works for later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wolf-tooth-12-speed-GRX-round-and-oval-chainrings-parts.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2462\" height=\"1150\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wolf-tooth-12-speed-GRX-round-and-oval-chainrings-parts.jpg\" alt=\"wolf tooth components chainrings for 12-speed shimano GRX\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wolf-tooth-12-speed-GRX-round-and-oval-chainrings-parts.jpg 2462w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wolf-tooth-12-speed-GRX-round-and-oval-chainrings-parts-297x139.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wolf-tooth-12-speed-GRX-round-and-oval-chainrings-parts-800x374.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wolf-tooth-12-speed-GRX-round-and-oval-chainrings-parts-120x56.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wolf-tooth-12-speed-GRX-round-and-oval-chainrings-parts-768x359.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wolf-tooth-12-speed-GRX-round-and-oval-chainrings-parts-1536x717.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/wolf-tooth-12-speed-GRX-round-and-oval-chainrings-parts-2048x957.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The “ST” versions are designed for Shimano’s 12-speed Hyperglide chains, which is what the new 12-speed GRX groups use. The same chainrings are also available in their “Drop Stop B” tooth profile, which is for SRAM FlatTop and Eagle 12-speed chains as well as 9/10/11/12-speed chains from KMC, Connex, Wipperman, and Campagnolo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new GRX group allows you to swap cassettes and derailleur cages, but these make it easier to change the gear <em>ratios</em> depending on the severity of the gravel you’re riding, without affecting the total gear <em>range</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18985&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wolftoothcomponents.com%2Fcollections%2Fgravel-cyclocross-road\" target=\"_blank\">WolfToothComponents.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wolf-tooth-delivers-more-chainring-options-for-12-speed-shimano-grx/\">Wolf Tooth Delivers More Chainring Options for 12-Speed Shimano GRX</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"feedd71299cdbf746287afa4181e2871e54877bf3e02468e9b310e6654be468c","category":"Cycling"}
