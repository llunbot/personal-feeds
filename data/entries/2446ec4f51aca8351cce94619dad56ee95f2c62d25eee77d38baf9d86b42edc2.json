You’re not evaluating or describing any one experience so much as telling somebody that it might save them money, that it could be a fun project, and that the end result can be a point of pride. Though it would be easier, you can’t replicate the upgrade experience by simply buying another bike. It all depends on what you want out of an e-bike—or a weekend project.</p>\n<p>I’ve now converted two bikes with Swytch kits, I’ve walked my in-laws through upgrading their own cruiser-style bikes with them, and I’ve made tweaks and fixes to all of the bikes over two years. What I've learned is that there’s no single \"Swytch kit experience\" because every bike is a collection of components, and each component has dimensions and angles and quirks that play off the kit in different ways.</p>\n<p>Some people will drop the front wheel off their bike, replace it with Swytch’s wheel, strap down a few cables with zip-ties, mount a battery, and feel the boost on their first ride a couple hours later. Some people will learn a lot more about rims, tires, and beads than they knew before or discover that their seemingly normal-looking front fork is quirky and find that the dropouts require some filing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976101#p3\">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976101&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2446ec4f51aca8351cce94619dad56ee95f2c62d25eee77d38baf9d86b42edc2","category":"Tech"}
