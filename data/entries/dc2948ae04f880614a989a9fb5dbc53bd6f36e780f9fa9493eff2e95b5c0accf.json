{"title":"Republican Profiles in Courage","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zktKBy3hNHM","date":1716590971000,"content":"\n<p>Various comments from Nikki Haley regarding Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/all-the-things-nikki-haley-said-about-donald-trump-before-announcing-shell-be-voting-for-him-in-november\">while she was campaigning against him for the Republican nomination</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“If you mock the service of a combat veteran, you don’t deserve a driver’s license, let alone being president of the United States.”</li>\n<li>“We can’t have, as Republicans, him as the nominee. He can’t win a general election. That’s the problem. We’ve got to go and have someone who can actually win.”</li>\n<li>“This may be his survival mode to pay his legal fees and get out of some sort of legal peril, but this is like suicide for our country.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/nikki-haley-says-she-ll-163129306.html\">Also Haley</a>, this week: “I will be voting for Trump.”</p>\n\n<p>Here’s hoping Trump gives her the Bill Barr treatment. Barr, who wrote in his own 2022 book that Trump has “shown he has neither the temperament nor persuasive powers to provide the kind of positive leadership that is needed​,” <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/politics/bill-barr-donald-trump-vote/index.html\">recently said</a> he’d be voting for him anyway.</p>\n\n<p>In a sign of appreciation for his own former attorney general’s support, <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112329627037807609\">Trump posted this nice note on Truth Social</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wow! Former A.G. Bill Barr, who let a lot of great people down by\nnot investigating Voter Fraud in our Country, has just Endorsed me\nfor President despite the fact that I called him “Weak, Slow\nMoving, Lethargic, Gutless, and Lazy” (New York Post!). Based on\nthe fact that I greatly appreciate his wholehearted Endorsement, I\nam removing the word “Lethargic” from my statement. Thank you\nBill. MAGA2024!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All class.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/24/republican-profiles-in-courage\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dc2948ae04f880614a989a9fb5dbc53bd6f36e780f9fa9493eff2e95b5c0accf","category":"Tech"}
