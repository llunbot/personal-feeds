This means that they will need to offer considerable flexibility to ensure you can easily and safely brake and change gears, as well as offer good grip on the handlebars.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews of the best winter cycling gloves</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Assos Ultraz Winter Gloves: RRP £105 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/assos-ultraz-winter-gloves-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Café du Cycliste Classic gloves: RRP £70 – <strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cafe-du-cycliste-classic-gloves-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Castelli Perfetto RoS Gloves: RRP £85 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/castelli-perfetto-ros-gloves-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>GripGrab Polaris 2 waterproof winter gloves: RRP £89.95</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Le Col Hors Categorie Deep Winter gloves: RRP £80 </strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Maap Winter Gloves: RRP £85 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/maap-winter-gloves-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pas Normal Studios Logo Deep Winter Gloves: RRP £90 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/pas-normal-studios-logo-deep-winter-gloves-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rapha Winter Gloves: RRP £85 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/rapha-winter-gloves-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sportful Fiandre gloves: RRP £110 – <strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sportful-fiandre-gloves-review-2\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Universal Colours Mono Thermal gloves: RRP £65 </strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Keep reading for full reviews</em> <em>and detailed buying advice.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Why should you trust our advice?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/gwp-winterbikes-0550-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"gwp-winterbikes-0550\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re cyclists who know and love cycling kit.

We found these gloves strike a good balance between insulation and the necessary dexterity for effective use of the bike’s controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also noted that they have enough insulation to keep your hands warm in classic southern UK winter temperatures and are more than adequate for the typical temperatures of around 5°C to 10°C. However, compared to others, these gloves do lack padding in the palms so aren’t well suited to super-long days in the saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cafe-du-cycliste-classic-gloves-review\" target=\"_blank\">Café du Cycliste Classic gloves review </a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Castelli Perfetto RoS Gloves</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Cyclist-Badge_Eds-1.png\" /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/DSC02129-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Castelli Perfetto RoS winter gloves\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/DSC02129-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/DSC02129-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/DSC02129-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/DSC02129-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/DSC02129-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/DSC02129-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/DSC02129-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/DSC02129-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/DSC02129-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/DSC02129-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Katherine Moore</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£85 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6821&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.Castelli-Perfetto-RoS-Long-Finger-Gloves_214314.htm%3Fsku%3D671481%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3DClothing%2520%253E%2520Gloves%2520%253E%2520Long%2520finger%2520gloves%26utm_content%3DCastelli%26gad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMIguWa_JiShQMVBo9QBh0-AgWIEAQYBCABEgIUHfD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros: </strong>Cosy fleece lining, warm even when wet</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cons: </strong>Rated for use in milder temperatures between 4° and 14°C, tricky to get on once wet</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>More of a transition season and early winter glove than a deep winter offering, the Castelli Perfetto RoS gloves quickly became a go-to for milder rides. Their single-layer construction made the ride feel as close as you can get to feeling like you’re not wearing gloves, with impressive dexterity and grip. Despite their thin material, the fleece-backed material offers plentiful warmth down to 6°C, though they’re certainly the type of glove that’s best left on once fitted, as when damp they can be much more tricky to get back on.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/castelli-perfetto-ros-gloves-review\" target=\"_blank\">Castelli Perfetto RoS Gloves review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>GripGrab Polaris 2 waterproof winter gloves</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/gripgrab-gloves-1-970x581.jpg\" alt=\"gripgrab-gloves-1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£77.37 – £82.58 | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4fDTXwb\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Fully waterproof, good warmth, good grip, 75% recycled</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Bulky</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Made for the coldest and wettest days out on the bike, these are the only fully waterproof gloves in our guide. The GripGrab Polaris 2 have a rating of 15K (15,000mm), which translates to dry hands even in torrential downpours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gloves are brilliantly warm thanks to the three-layer construction and PrimaLoft Gold insulation on the palm and back of the gloves, ensuring hands remain toasty. All this insulation does mean they are on the bulkier side but this isn’t overly so that the gloves become burdensome to actual cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also have padded and grippy palms with silicone strips on the first three fingers and upper palm, which gives them good handlebar grip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, GripGrab says 75% of their material is recycled, which makes them a great choice for the environmentally conscious. Shown here are the black pair but you can also nab these in hi-vis if that’s your jam.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Le Col Hors Categorie Deep Winter gloves</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/lecol-gloves-2-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/lecol-gloves-2-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/lecol-gloves-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/lecol-gloves-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/lecol-gloves-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/lecol-gloves-2-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/lecol-gloves-2-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/lecol-gloves-2-1140x641.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£80 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=15692&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flecol.cc%2Fproducts%2Fhors-categorie-deep-winter-gloves%3Fvariant%3D30698352443455\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Good dexterity, decent warmth for UK winters</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Not fully waterproof, need to be careful on sizing</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Made from polyester and elastane. the Hors Categorie Deep Winter gloves are Le Col’s warmest offering. Featuring windproof and thermal fleeced materials to keep the winter out, the gloves have a comfortable snug fit and keep hands toasty. While the gloves offer decent levels of warmth, they aren’t bulky and instead have a notably slim design. They are very dexterous so using levers is a breeze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Added to this are the silicone grippers on the palm, which ensure good grip on the handlebars. Like many in this guide, the Le Col gloves have an elongated neoprene cuff for a neat overlap between glove and jacket to ensure you stay warm and reflective panels on the side for added visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a microfibre suede nose wipe over the back of the thumb. Of note is that these gloves are not fully waterproof but have a DWR coating for some water resistance. Also, Le Col’s size guide is unique so it’s definitely worth measuring your hands before buying.

Some brands will provide useful guides such as temperature gauges as to when the gloves should be used but, if not, look for features like windproof materials, fleece linings and double material constructions for a toasty feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Waterproofing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting any of your three contact points (backside, hands and feet) wet on a ride can be miserable and enough to put you off cycling for at least a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands will utilise waterproof technologies – such as Gore-Tex – to provide an impermeable barrier to even the heaviest downpours without diminishing the gloves’ ability to breathe. Some gloves are water-resistant rather than completely waterproof but ultimately, keeping warm is the key thing, and that doesn’t necessarily depending on being 100% waterproof.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dexterity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing gear and braking are two very important aspects of riding a bike. This means that gloves need to provide a real-life feel, akin to gloveless hands, which will let you be in total control of your levers and shifters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Comfort and grip</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like dexterity, gloves without grip are pretty useless for cycling and, in fact, quite dangerous. Some brands will use silicone grippers to increase grip and also make handling stuff such as mobile phones easier. Glove designers may also incorporate strategic padding to cushion your hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Nose/glasses wipe</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s gross but it’s useful. Some winter gloves will include a soft panel for wiping the runny nose you’ll inevitably get on cold days and you’ll be grateful when it saves you chafing your chilly face. If you’re not using it for your nose, it’s handy for wiping mist or rain off <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cycling-sunglasses-the-best-photochromic-sunglasses-for-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">cycling glasses</a>. Just don’t mix the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Size</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any piece of kit, make sure your new pair of gloves fit properly and assess the size guides before buying. Some riders prefer to err on the larger side for winter gloves as the extra space within makes them warmer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re trying on gloves in a shop, it’s a wise idea to opt up a size compared to what you might think would work best. When you get onto the bike and onto the drops or shifters, the material of the gloves is pulled a little tighter, so if you have a snug fit off the bike, then it may become restrictive or even uncomfortable in the riding position. It’s just like an aero-cut jersey or jacket; they don’t seem to fit quite right off the bike, but once you’re riding it all makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sizing up is also a good idea if you’re planning to use glove liners (ie, a thin additional inner glove), which can be a good option for particularly cold weather, or for riders who really struggle to keep their hands warm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to learn more about the science behind cold hands?
