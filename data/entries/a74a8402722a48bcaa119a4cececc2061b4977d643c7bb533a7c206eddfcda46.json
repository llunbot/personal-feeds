The lawsuit claims the price was listed as 33 percent off and a \"Limited time deal\" and that Amazon \"advertised a List Price of $449.99, with the $449.99 in strikethrough text.” As of this writing, the 50-inch 4-Series 4K TV on Amazon is marked as having a \"Limited time deal\" of $299.98.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050596#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050596&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a74a8402722a48bcaa119a4cececc2061b4977d643c7bb533a7c206eddfcda46","category":"Tech"}
