These helmets not only need to be efficient in a time trial position but they need to be optimized for a rider’s specific position and body composition. As a result, you see what amounts to a truly wide spread of aero helmets, even within teams.</span></p>\n<p><span>Without further adieu, here are the wildest helmets at found at the <a href=\"https://www.velonews.com/news/road/jury-still-out-on-paris-nice-ttt-format-after-tadej-pogacar-sprints-alone-to-line/\">Paris-Nice Team Time Trial</a>. Maybe tomorrow they’ll be used in the next Star Wars series—or in some cases the next Mel Brooks spoof.</span></p>\n<figure>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ParisNiceTTT2023_ProXhelmet-min-1340x893.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Uno-X Pro Cycling team time trial Sweet Protection Redeemer 2Vi\" width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" /><figcaption>Uno-X Pro Cycling showed up with the time trial helmet that’s set pro cycling fans ablaze, a Sweet Protection Redeemer 2Vi. Its smooth shape paired with a golden yellow color reminds me of the eggs over easy I had at breakfast. Easily the wildest helmet setup we’ve seen this week.

The Tempor is the old standby for weird time trial helmets, with a side pod look that aims to better smooth airflow from the rider’s head to back. While the Tempor has been around for a number of years, its sweeping cape of design still intrigues today.

Amongst other road helmets, Movistar’s choice is probably the most conventional looking.

Its rounded front profile makes it almost look like a ski helmet from afar.

The stubby profile in comparison to wilder helmets looks more conventional, but that integrated visor earns the wasp name.

We presume that because Bontrager doesn’t have a dedicated time trial helmet, the team was able to use the optimal helmet for each rider’s position.

The Giant Rivett TT helmet eschews the integrated visor, a bold choice these days. But the four ports up front and the marbled blue finish make me want to put my fingers in it and roll it down a bowling lane.
