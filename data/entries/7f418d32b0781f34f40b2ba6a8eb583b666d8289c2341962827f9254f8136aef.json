The issue has been mentioned by several users across the <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/search-cant-find-old-messages-on-new-phone.2404157\">MacRumors Forums</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/16orvq0/ios_17_search_function_for_imessage_only_showing/\">Reddit</a> since the devices launched earlier this month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe bug is present on all iOS 17 versions up to the first iOS 17.1 beta, but many affected users said it <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/16yy2b6/ios_171_developer_beta_2_released/k3bd5fc/\">has been fixed</a> as of the second iOS 17.1 beta. It may take a day or longer for the device to index and restore the older messages after installing the update. Some users said they needed to open the Settings app, tap on Messages, tap on Siri &amp; Search, turn off all of the settings shown, restart the iPhone, and re-enable those settings to fix the issue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.1 is expected to be released in late October, so users not interested in installing the beta might have to wait a few more weeks for the fix.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/profile/raymond-wong-18812870\">Ray Wong</a>!)</em><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/\">Messages</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/ios-17-1-beta-2-seems-to-fix-messages-search-bug/\">iOS 17.1 Beta 2 Fixes Messages Search Bug on iPhone 15 Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-beta-2-fixes-messages-search-bug-on-iphone-15-models.2406439/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7f418d32b0781f34f40b2ba6a8eb583b666d8289c2341962827f9254f8136aef","category":"Apple"}
