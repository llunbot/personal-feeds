He used the Classified hub in the GP Le Samyn on Tuesday 28th February where he made it into the break and helped set up his teammate Milan Menten for the win.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_13-970x728.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_13-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_13-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_13-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_13-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_13-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_13-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_13-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Classified</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Campenaerts is renowned for his preference for exceptionally large chainrings – he’s using an immense 62-tooth chainring on his new Powershift setup – and said the decision to use the internally geared hub was simple. ‘I am riding Classified because it is by the far the most efficient setup for the bike’, said Campenaerts. ‘It allows me to ditch the front derailleur, shift gears under full load and run a bigger chainring.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that he set the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">Hour record</a> (since toppled) in Mexico in 2019, the Belgian knows a thing or two about speed and efficiency. While individual endorsements help bring credibility to a brand, the tech underpinning the Powershift hub speaks for itself to an extent, and it was awarded the Design &amp; Innovation Award for road components in 2021.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/parcours-classified-powershift-wheels\">Parcours becomes first UK brand to bring third-party Classified Powershift wheels to market</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/classified-powershift-hub-review\">Classified Powershift hub review</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/worldtour-team-bikes\">WorldTour team bikes 2023: Cyclist’s complete guide</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>How could the Powershift hub benefit pro riders?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"708\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_6-970x708.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_6-970x708.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_6-300x219.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_6-768x561.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_6-1536x1121.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_6-2048x1495.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_6-750x547.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_6-1140x832.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Classified</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 2019, Classified set out to remove the need for front derailleurs on bicycles with its Powershift hub.

By doing away with the front derailleur, Classified says it has drastically reduced the risk of dropped chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While technically not a performance gain in the traditional sense, stopping to fix a dropped chain is obviously an inefficient use of time, and reducing the risk of this happening is a useful side effect of the Powershift hub’s other advantages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Equal access to optimal cadence</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_7-970x546.png\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_7-970x546.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_7-300x169.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_7-768x432.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_7-1536x864.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_7-750x422.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_7-1140x641.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub_7.png 2000w\" /><figcaption>Classified</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>1× drivetrains can offer some of the aforementioned benefits, such as improved aerodynamics or reduced risk of chain drop but come at the cost of limited gear selection. 1× drivetrains typically feature bigger incremental jumps from gear to gear to allow the cassette to cover sufficient range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the Powershift hub system provides two gear ratios within the hub itself, the need for a wide range cassette is largely mitigated. Riders still have access to the smaller steps between gears and the same combination of gear options as a conventional 2× drivetrain, which allows them to ride at their optimal cadence in a given scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many are still put off by the idea of an internal hub, conflating the idea with those seen on hybrid and city bikes. These systems typically use an internal hub to replace both the front and rear derailleur and, as such, tend to house between three and 11 gears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the intended use and the greater number of internal gears, these hubs are generally quite heavy and wouldn’t be suitable for a pro-level race bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/classified_powershift_hub-620x413.jpg 620w\" /><figcaption>Classified</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Powershift hub, on the other hand, is comparably light at a claimed 475g. Factor in that it removes the need for a front derailleur and a small chainring, and uses a lightweight cassette – just 190g claimed weight – and weight becomes less of an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Classified hopes to dispel general apprehensions about the concept with the likes of Campenaerts using its tech.
