Warp is a blazingly fast, Rust-based terminal reimagined from the ground up to work like a modern app. A lot of “modern” terminal apps just offer ways to make your windows look cool — colors, transparency, stuff like that. Warp offers all of that in spades — it’s a very cool-looking terminal. But Warp is highly innovative in <em>functional</em> ways too. Even if you don’t care at all how your terminal looks, Warp is definitely worth checking out.</p>\n\n<p>Warp lets you edit your commands like in an IDE, with selections, auto-suggestions, and completion menus. Generate commands from natural language using AI so you don’t have to context switch to Google (or whatever your preferred search engine is) anymore. Navigate through your terminal output command-by-command instead of scrolling through a wall of text.</p>\n\n<p>And with the newly released Warp Drive, there’s a secure place to save your commands as workflows so you can annotate, share, and execute them on-demand.</p>\n\n<p>Warp works with bash, zsh, and fish (my favorite shell) and requires zero config. You can just download it and start using it. It’s been my go-to terminal app for over a year now.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/06/warp\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"256272528d274f2f8ee62fbea2b7a536944c237e84deaaa22a7b4dee05c31e62","category":"Tech"}
