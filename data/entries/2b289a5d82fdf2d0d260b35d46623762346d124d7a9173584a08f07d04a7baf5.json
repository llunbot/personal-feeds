Outpatient visits for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) were down that week, the first decline after weeks of rapid increases. Flu test positivity and hospitalizations were also down slightly.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/iliactivity.jpg\"><img alt=\"Percent of outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses by week. \" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/iliactivity-640x503.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/iliactivity-1280x1005.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/iliactivity.jpg\">Percent of outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses by week. </a> (credit: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm\">CDC</a>)</p></div>\n<p>But transmission is still elevated around the country.
