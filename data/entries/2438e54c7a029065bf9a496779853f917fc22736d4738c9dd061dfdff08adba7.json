Users will need to sign in with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> or create one.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe PlayStation website suggests that gamers use ‌Apple Music‌ to create a personalized gaming playlist to listen to before, during, and after gameplay sessions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌Apple Music‌ promotion is only available on the PlayStation 5, and it has to be redeemed on a PlayStation 5 console. Only new and qualified returning subscribers to ‌Apple Music‌ can get free access, so this is not a deal that is available to current subscribers. New subscribers will receive six months of ‌Apple Music‌, while returning subscribers will get five months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will be <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/apple-music-playstation-offers\">offering the deal</a> until 11/15/24.
