Apple is aiming to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. Last week, Apple announced that it surpassed a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-announces-major-reduction-in-gas-emissions/\">60% reduction in its global greenhouse gas emissions</a> compared to 2015 levels. More details are available in the company's <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2025.pdf\">2025 Environmental Progress Report</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSecond, Apple recently launched an Earth Day promotion that offers customers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-earth-day-recycling-promotion/\">10% off eligible Apple accessories when they recycle eligible devices</a> at participating Apple Stores. The offer is available through May 16 in the U.S. and many other countries.

With this feature, the devices will charge at times of the day when the electric grid is relatively cleaner, as much as possible.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFinally, Apple is celebrating Earth Day with content across some other apps and services. For example, Apple Fitness+ subscribers can listen to a new Time to Walk episode featuring actress and climate advocate Shailene Woodley.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earth-day/\">Earth Day</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/apple-celebrating-earth-day-in-five-ways/\">Apple Celebrating Earth Day in These Five Ways</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-celebrating-earth-day-in-these-five-ways.2455753/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"638edf5101306de4b1c49c369085686145c798c7ef3728a45073dd78bdf2637f","category":"Apple"}
