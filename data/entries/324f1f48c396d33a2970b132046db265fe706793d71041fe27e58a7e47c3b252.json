That’s a link to my lovely article on the nine weird and wonderful cycling disciplines going on <em>right now</em> at the 2023 UCI Cycling World Championships in Scotland. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, as I like to call it, the BBJ – Big Bicycling Jamboree – where every type of bike sport imaginable is competing under one metaphorical roof. It’s amazing, especially the BMX.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, I lie. There’s no bike polo, no downhill unicycling nor recumbent racing. So there is <em>some </em>room for improvement. But it’s bikes. It’s great. Go <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uci-road-cycling-world-championships-route-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">read our handy guide</a> then go check the UCI Worlds out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also links nicely to my third favourite story of recent weeks, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hope-lotus-track-bike-team-gb-2023\" target=\"_blank\">Hope-Lotus track bike</a> that’s being raced at the BBJ. It looks mental, it looks oddly vulnerable, it looks incredibly fast. Great job British engineering!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My second favourite story? Well that would be the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/greg-lemond-podcast-2\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast with Greg LeMond</a>, where Greg told us all about getting shot, getting back up and winning the most exciting Tour de France in history (yes, even more exciting than <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-2023-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">this year’s Tour… still, you gotta see these photos</a>). I loved speaking to Greg, and I think you’ll enjoy the listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my first favourite story? It’s our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2023\" target=\"_blank\">round up of the Tour de France Femmes</a>. Why? Because the TdFF rules, once again proving a fantastic addition to the calendar (just make it longer please ASO), and because it’s a gloriously photo-heavy article, and really we all prefer pictures over words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, have a look at this lot.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

long been my favourite tyres, but one issue has always plagued them – longevity. But no more, for the new Vittoria Corsa Pro sees a shift to a hybrid construction method that Vittoria reckons makes them more robust. They are also exclusively tubeless, and in keeping with the wide tyre trend, go up to a size 34mm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fans of the originals will be happy to note the Corsa Pro’s carcass is still 320TPI cotton (TPI = threads per inch).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quantitative judgements around longevity are hard, but Vittoria claims the Corsa Pro has an 18% increase in puncture protection over the Vittoria Corsa 2.0, which should mean something. And though anecdotal and nothing to do with mileage, I spoke to Vittoria’s product manager, Ken Avery, who said the tan sidewalls are much ‘less prone to staining’ than ever before. I like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the speed-conscious, Vittoria claims a 12% decrease in rolling resistance. Because I have no friends I can verify this as being largely true thanks to data from independent testers <em>bicyclerollingresistance.com</em>. I pay to be a Pro Member of the website. Who wants to touch me? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just how is this possible? Because the tread is now ‘electrically vulcanised’ to the carcass instead of being glued on, as per all previous Vittoria Corsas.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-1-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>James Spender</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So why does this matter and why is Vittoria special? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vulcanisation is a chemical process – usually involving heat and pressure – where tread and carcass become one homogenous mass, and it’s how the majority of bike tyres are made. But here’s the rub: vulcanised tyres usually employ nylon thread as cotton thread can’t withstand the heating/chemical process, and nylon thread is <em>de facto</em> thicker than cotton, hence vulcanised tyres have lower thread counts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A vulcanised Continental GP5000 tyre, for example, is 110TPI (even though their marketing literature lists them as 330TPI – this is only as there are three 110TPI plies layered up). The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/vittoria-corsa-next-review\">Vittoria Corsa N.Ext</a>, which <em>is</em> nylon, is 100TPI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, vulcanised tyres’ strength is that they tend to be harder wearing. Vulcanised rubber treads last longer than the natural rubber found on glued tyres; nylon doesn’t rot like cotton can; and the vulcanisation process does away with any propensity for a glued tyre to suffer delaminating (peeling away) of the tread. Vulcanised tyres also don’t end up with the ridge line where the tread sits slightly proud of the carcass, which is often cited as something that inhibits cornering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why does thread count matter? Because a high TPI cotton tyre tends to be more supple – in much the same way as a high thread-count cotton sheet drapes over an object more easily than a hessian sack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More supple tyres tend to offer greater cornering grip and rolling smoothness, because a more pliable tyre carcass deforms more readily over road surfaces, thereby increasing contact (better grip) and reducing vibrations (increased perception of smoothness). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given all this, Vittoria’s new approach is, in theory, a best of both worlds: keep the thread count and the cotton but improve all-round tyre life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t see a downside, yet – though I have only been riding these for a few weeks. But oh yeah, they’re also £90 each, which is crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did pay £1.17 for a courgette the other day. Sign of the times.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20283&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freewheel.co.uk%2Fvittoria-corsa-pro-tyres-vartyvcorsapro\" target=\"_blank\">Freewheel (£89.99)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specialized/Fjällräven Expandable Hip Pack</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-1-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>James Spender</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Say it with me – <em>fe-yell-rev-en </em>– there you go, you got it.

Then if hydration bladders are your jam, there’s room for one of those to slide into an inner sleeve too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-3-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-3-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Fjallraven-Expandable-Hip-Pack-bag-3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>James Spender</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall build is very lightweight without feeling flimsy, but it should be said this bag isn’t waterproof, just ‘weather resistant’.

And where did the idea come from? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the 1968 Burt Lancaster film, <em>The Swimmer</em>. Which I have now watched. And it’s weird and brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"641\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/The-Swimmer-film-2-2-970x641.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/The-Swimmer-film-2-2-970x641.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/The-Swimmer-film-2-2-300x198.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/The-Swimmer-film-2-2-768x507.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/The-Swimmer-film-2-2-1536x1014.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/The-Swimmer-film-2-2-750x495.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/The-Swimmer-film-2-2-1140x753.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/The-Swimmer-film-2-2.jpeg 1920w\" /><figcaption>Columbia Pictures</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The plot is simple – Ned Merrill (Lancaster) is at a pool party in Connecticut when he suddenly realises he can ‘swim my way home’, running in between a series of other people’s pools, taking a short swim across each one, to get back to his daughters who are ‘at home playing tennis’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one sense that’s all you need to know; in another it helps to understand this is part of the surrealist film movement (NB I found this out after the fact, I ain’t that clever). It’s therefore supposed to be weird – dreamlike, often nonsensical and sometimes creepy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caveat: taken at face value this is a film from 1968 that contains some problematic scenes, specifically in the misogyny sense. But this isn’t James Bond where all that gets glorified, rather this is a tale of woe. It’s almost fable-like. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Factoid: Apparently the story it’s based on was the inspiration for the HBO TV series, <em>Mad Men</em>. It’s also an hour and a half long, which is the perfect and proper length for any film.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks Trevor!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Watch The Swimmer now on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3OeakTe\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></strong> <strong>or <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftv.apple.com%2Fgb%2Fmovie%2Fthe-swimmer%2Fumc.cmc.1a48nf37ylo5nobvgzovva2at%3Faction%3Dplay\" target=\"_blank\">Apple TV</a></strong></li></ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vittoria-corsa-pro-tyres\">In The Drops: Vittoria Corsa Pro tyres, Fjällräven × Specialized backpack, Rudy Project sunglasses and The Swimmer (1968) film</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"James Spender &#124; Deputy Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"324f1f48c396d33a2970b132046db265fe706793d71041fe27e58a7e47c3b252","category":"Cycling"}
