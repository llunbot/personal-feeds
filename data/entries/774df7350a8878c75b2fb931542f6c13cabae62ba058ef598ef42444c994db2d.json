With titles ranging from “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnHIS1AJu5I\">Yeah, I’m Rocking a Headband</a>” to “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7__L9VhZ6o\">Joe Biden, Retire</a>” (posted July 1), his pop tunes are at turns whimsical and topical. Some go viral.</p>\n<p>Still, says the Connecticut-based Mann (aka “Song a Day Mann”), monetization was a “slog.” Sales from distribution platform Bandcamp and advertising revenue from YouTube “never amounted to much.” Conference performances and jingle contests filled the gaps.
