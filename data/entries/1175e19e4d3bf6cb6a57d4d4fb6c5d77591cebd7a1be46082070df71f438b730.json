However, the new titanium finish will be less prone to scratches compared to stainless steel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌‌brushed finish on ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models‌‌ is considerably less reflective than the finish of previous Pro iPhones. It is less prone to fingerprints and also reduces scratch visibility. Apart from looks though, Apple's use of a titanium frame for its ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ devices also cut down the weight of the devices. The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max are approximately nine percent lighter than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> Pro and ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, the titanium frame and aluminum substructure also provides better heat dissipation than any previous-generation Pro models with stainless steel frames, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA rumor earlier this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/iphone-16-pro-new-space-black-rose-colors/\">claimed</a> that the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models will come in new \"space black\" and \"rose\" titanium colors. The \"rose\" is a gold shade, while \"space black\" could replace the black titanium option. Apple is expected to release the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> series in the fall.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/\">Naver</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/iphone-16-pro-new-polished-titanium-finish/\">iPhone 16 Pro Models Could Feature New Polished Titanium Finish</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-models-could-feature-new-polished-titanium-finish.2423072/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1175e19e4d3bf6cb6a57d4d4fb6c5d77591cebd7a1be46082070df71f438b730","category":"Apple"}
