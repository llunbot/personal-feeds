I always thought it was so nice because you get to meet everybody. I ride for Lidl, so maybe I can ask them for a job after I retire! </span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>What was your first bike?</strong></p>\n<p><span>It was a purple one and my dad made it for me. Living in the Netherlands, you learn to ride a bike when you are three years old. I don’t really remember it but I have seen it in photographs. Pretty soon I was without stabilisers. I immediately liked it, I remember my mum said I couldn’t take off the stabilisers, but I said I wanted to take them off.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>What is your least favourite thing about cycling?</strong></p>\n<p><span>Right now, it’s going away from home. Especially since we have the little one now. Longer stage races and training camps… last year I think when I did the Olympics it was the first time I was away for two weeks and then afterwards we had the Tour de France, which was another 10 days, and that was really long. Before I had a relationship, I didn’t care at all, but now I have something to go home for. </span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>What is your strongest characteristic?</strong></p>\n<p><span>Perseverance. When I really want something, and I have it in my head, I can go really deep to reach it. That’s been true all my life. When I was world champion time triallist in 2013, I really wanted to win it again and it took me eight years. It was a bit of a bumpy road, but I wanted it so deeply. I never say that you can always achieve your dreams because it’s not true, but it definitely helps when you have a strong ambition in your mind.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Do you have any annoying habits?</strong></p>\n<p><span>Yes. Ask my boyfriend.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>Who is your funniest team-mate?</strong></p>\n<p><span>Lizzie Deignan. She always brings good conversations, and we almost never talk about cycling at the table, which is really good. We always have a lot of fun.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>What is the quality you most admire in a friend?</strong></p>\n<p><span>Two things. Humour, but also trust. I’m away a lot and I do not see my friends that often, so we need to trust each other in that friendship. As a cyclist I think it’s harder to make deep friendships at home because you’re just not that often there. The ones that you have, they really understand your lifestyle?</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20241114_RL_Ellen_0008_2048x2048.jpg?v=1745776498\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p><em>Image: Veronique Rolland</em><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>What has been your proudest career moment?</strong></p>\n<p><span>The World Championships Time Trial win in 2021. Like I said before, I won it before but I wanted to reach that again. Winning it again after those eight years was such an emotion and such a relief from all the efforts I’d made, everything that I tried and all the times I feared that it wouldn’t happen again. It came from really deep, but it was special because it gave me confidence again. It wasn’t hard to find motivation afterwards, we still had Paris-Roubaix to aim for in October that year, then I ended up getting a bad concussion after that. I had to take some time off and restart slowly, but we had a new goal already with the Hour Record, which was super motivating for me. </span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>Do you prefer racing or training?</strong></p>\n<p><span>Training. I just like to do it. I like racing as well, but there is always pressure, and it’s demanding. Riding in a peloton is not always my favourite thing to do and in training you can do whatever you want. Of course, I wouldn’t </span><span>only </span><span>train – it prepares me to race, but I think training is mentally easier. With training, I like the improvement I get. I like to have a clear task and do that, but I do like cycling itself as well – I wouldn’t have had a 20-year career if I didn’t. </span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>What is your favourite place to train?</strong></p>\n<p><span>Gran Canaria. There’s a lot of climbing but it’s really easy to do long training rides, it’s always good weather. If you’re there, especially in January, it’s really nice and I like to be there.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>What will you miss about professional cycling after you retire?</strong></p>\n<p><span>There will be a lot of things. It’s a privilege to be a professional cyclist. First of all, everything is paid for by the team, your equipment, trips and the racing. I’m spoiled as a professional athlete and I’m kind of used to it, but I’m still conscious it’s not normal and when you quit I think you realise how much other people have been doing for you and what kind of privilege you have. I will also miss having clear goals and working towards those goals and waking up every morning with a plan and idea of what I’m going to do. </span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>Which phone app do you use the most?</strong></p>\n<p><span>Whatsapp. I like to chat with friends, and it’s also useful. Social media is nice also but I try not to look too much into it. I’m not so active on Instagram and I try to limit it because I’ve noticed it doesn’t really make me happy.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>How do you spend your off season? </strong></p>\n<p><span>This was the first time we’ve had the off season with a little son, so it was a little different this year. Otherwise we would always go on holiday somewhere and do a lot of hiking, stuff like that. This year we actually stayed at home with him, in the Netherlands, which was nicer. Now we appreciate the chance to be at home and not always be travelling. It gives me a different rest.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>If you could give one piece of advice to your younger self, what would it be?</strong></p>\n<p><span>Don’t be so hard on yourself. Have a bit more compassion with yourself sometimes, so you can enjoy things a little bit more. </span></p>\n<p><strong>What’s your favourite movie?</strong></p>\n<p><span>Lion King. </span><span>I love it! I still cry every time when Simba is dying. I love the music and it always makes me happy.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>What’s your favourite band?</strong></p>\n<p><span>Pink. It’s a different kind of music, I like the lyrics and tunes and you can really sing out loud to it, which I like.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>What is your go-to order at the bar?</strong></p>\n<p><span>Red wine.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>What was your hardest moment on the bike?</strong></p>\n<p><span>Maybe Paris-Roubaix in 2021, the first edition. I crashed four times and the last time was really hard. I had a concussion and I still wanted to finish but it was for me a really hard day.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><strong>Would you rather be in the mountains or at the beach?</strong></p>\n<p><span>Mountains. I love mountains, there are so many things to do – hiking, riding your bike, skiing in the winter. There are lots of chances to have fun there and the beach is a bit boring for me. </span></p>\n<p><em>Cover image: Zac Williams/SWpix.com</em></p>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"63405d1a7282d7a2982df30e606881c72855e98442638626a610fad1a842c8c3","category":"Cycling"}
