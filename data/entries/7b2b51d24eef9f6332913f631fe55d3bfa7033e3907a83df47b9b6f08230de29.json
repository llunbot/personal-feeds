Tiptop is a completely new way to pay that makes everything you buy more affordable with trade-in at checkout. It’s incredibly easy. At checkout, you simply select any item you own that you want to trade in from Tiptop’s catalog of over 50,000 choices, and you’ll receive instant credit towards your purchase.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a merchant, you can easily enable Tiptop with no up front costs, Shopify checkout support, and <a href=\"https://docs.tiptop.com/\">great APIs</a> for integration with any store. Plus, they are currently offering $10,000 in Tiptop Promotional Credit that you can use to help your customers learn about Tiptop without discounting.</p>\n\n<p>Get started now as a merchant, or experience Tiptop as a shopper at <a href=\"https://tiptop.com/articles/tiptop-partners\">partners like Nothing Tech, Daylight, Cradlewise, and King of Christmas</a>. (And if you’re thinking Tiptop rings a bell, you may recall that after leaving TechCrunch last year, <a href=\"https://www.theobsessor.com/hey-im-joining-tiptop/\">Matthew Panzarino joined Tiptop</a>, and we chatted about it <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2024/01/31/ep-394\">when last he was on The Talk Show</a> earlier this year.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/15/tiptop\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7b2b51d24eef9f6332913f631fe55d3bfa7033e3907a83df47b9b6f08230de29","category":"Tech"}
