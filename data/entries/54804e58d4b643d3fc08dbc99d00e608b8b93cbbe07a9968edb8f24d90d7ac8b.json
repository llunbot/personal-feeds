For the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-vs-iphone-16/\">iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus</a>, this includes the A18 chip with support for Apple Intelligence, the Action button, faster charging, revamped Photographic Styles, and the all-new Camera Control button. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> take things further with larger display size options with slimmer bezels, a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, improved audio recording, and a significant battery life boost.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe discuss the Apple Watch Series 10 and new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-watch-ultra-satin-black-milanese-loop/\">Satin Black color option</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. The Series 10 features redesigned casings and larger screen sizes, a new wide-angle OLED display with a faster refresh rate for an improved experience in always-on mode, sleep apnea detection, a water temperature sensor and depth gauge, a speaker with media playback, and faster charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe also take a look at the fourth-generation AirPods with Active Noise Cancellation and the new hearing protection, testing, and aid features for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> 2. Apple also brought a minor update to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a> that switches Lightning for USB-C and refreshes its selection of color options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFinally, we weigh up the event as a whole and take a look forward at some of the early rumors for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> lineup to consider who should upgrade this year and who may be better off waiting until next year. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a
