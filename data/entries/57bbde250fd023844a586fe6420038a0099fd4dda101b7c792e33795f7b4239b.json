Biden will make the announcement this afternoon in remarks during his visit to theÂ National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>\n<p>The president's plan includes expanding access to free at-home rapid testing and setting policy to ensure that over-the-counter, at-home tests are covered by health insurance plans. It also tightens health protocols for travel. Starting early next week, every inbound international traveler to the US will need to test negative within one day of their departure, regardless of nationality and vaccination status. The plan also calls for extending mask requirements on airplanes, trains, and public transit into March.</p>\n<p>To fight surges in cases from delta and omicron, the administration is assembling over 60 emergency medical response teams to deploy to states in crisis. The administration is also working to secure 13 million doses of antiviral treatments.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817421#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817421&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"57bbde250fd023844a586fe6420038a0099fd4dda101b7c792e33795f7b4239b","category":"Tech"}
