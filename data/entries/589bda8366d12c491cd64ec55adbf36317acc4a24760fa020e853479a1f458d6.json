She was also very much in demand as a speaker in her later career. Hopper's famous 1982 lecture on \"Future Possibilities: Data, Hardware, Software, and People,\" has long been publicly unavailable because of the obsolete media on which it was recorded. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) finally managed to retrieve the footage for the National Security Agency (NSA), which <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3884041/nsa-releases-copy-of-internal-lecture-delivered-by-computing-giant-rear-adm-gra/\">posted the lecture</a> in two parts on YouTube (Part One embedded above, Part Two embedded below).</p>\n<p>Hopper earned undergraduate degrees in math and physics from Vassar College and a PhD in math from Yale in 1930. She returned to Vassar as a professor, but when World War II broke out, she sought to enlist in the US Naval Reserve. She was initially denied on the basis of her age (34) and low weight-to-height ratio, and also because her expertise made her particularly valuable to the war effort. Hopper got an exemption, and after graduating first in her class, she joined the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University, where she served on the Mark I computer programming staff under Howard H. Aiken.</p>\n<p>She stayed with the lab until 1949 and was next hired as a senior mathematician by Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation to develop the Universal Automatic Computer, or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/09/univac-the-troubled-life-of-americas-first-computer/\">UNIVAC</a>, the first computer. Hopper championed the development of a new programming language based on English words. \"It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols,\" she reasoned. \"So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English and the computers would translate them into machine code.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046172#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046172&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"589bda8366d12c491cd64ec55adbf36317acc4a24760fa020e853479a1f458d6","category":"Tech"}
