Did she just rub her eyes—tired? Is he licking his lips—hungry? The list of possible culprits and vague signs, made hazier by brutal sleep deprivation, can sometimes feel endless. But for one family in New England, the list seemed to be swiftly coming to an end as their baby continued to slip away from them.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2309725\">a detailed case report published today in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>, it all started when the parents of an otherwise healthy 8-week-old boy noticed that he started crying more and was more irritable. This was about a week before he would end up in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>\n<p>His grandmother, who primarily cared for him, noticed that he seemed to cry more vigorously when the right side of his abdomen was touched. The family took him to his pediatrician, who could find nothing wrong upon examination. Perhaps it was just gas, the pediatrician concluded—a common conclusion.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998853#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998853&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"68770d11d9d5b5f183b3bdf61f8a9bf6be1799d6e391e084e5d2a838272f269f","category":"Tech"}
