Whether you're deploying to Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, other cloud and SaaS offerings, or an on-premises datacenter, Terraform can be your single control plane to provision and manage your entire infrastructure.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1733783005-screenshot-2024-12-09-at-5-22-49-pm.png\" alt=\"Terraform\" /><h2><strong>HCP Terraform integrations</strong></h2>\n\n<p>HCP Terraform is a fully managed SaaS platform for teams and organizations to adopt and scale their Infrastructure Lifecycle Management, including state management, policy as code enforcement, drift detection, continuous health checks, and more. We had two new integrations this quarter:</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Datadog</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Datadog is a SaaS-based monitoring and analytics platform for large-scale applications and infrastructure. They have released a new <a href=\"https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/hcp_terraform/\">HCP Terraform Audit Logs with Datadog integration</a> that enables the collection of HCP Terraform audit trail log data for Datadog Cloud SIEM.  This allows users to control their HCP Terraform data retention, build custom widgets and dashboards, set up Cloud SIEM detection rules using the out-of-the-box Logs Pipeline, and cross-reference HCP Terraform events with the data from other services.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Overmind</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Overmind, makers of visibility and risk management tools for infrastructure as code development, have released a new <a href=\"https://docs.overmind.tech/integrations/terraform_enterprise\">HCP Terraform Run Task integration</a> to provide real-time impact analysis on Terraform changes. Overmind can identify the blast radius and uncover potential risks of changes before they can potentially harm infrastructure, allowing anyone to make changes with confidence.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Terraform Enterprise integrations</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Terraform Enterprise is the self-managed distribution of HCP Terraform that allows teams and organizations to adopt and scale their Infrastructure Lifecycle Management, including state management, policy as code enforcement, drift detection, continuous health checks, and more.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Red Hat</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Terraform Enterprise has a new flexible deployment <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise/deploy/openshift\">option</a> and now officially offers support for deploying Terraform Enterprise on Red Hat OpenShift clusters. This includes self-managed OpenShift Container Platform environments and hosted OpenShift services on Amazon Web Services (AWS ROSA), Microsoft Azure (Azure Red Hat OpenShift), Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Terraform providers</strong></h2>\n\n<p>As part of our continued focus on helping drive innovation and grow the Terraform ecosystem, we had nine new verified Terraform providers from six different partners over the previous quarter:</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Aembit</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Aembit boosts security by cryptographically verifying workload identities, in real time.  They’ve released the <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Aembit/aembit/latest\">Aembit provider</a>, which allows Terraform to interact with the configuration of the Aembit platform via the management API. </p>\n\n<h3><strong>CrowdStrike</strong></h3>\n\n<p>CrowdStrike, offers cybersecurity solutions through their cloud-native platform for protecting critical areas of enterprise risk — endpoints, cloud workloads, identities, and data. They have released the new <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CrowdStrike/crowdstrike/latest\">CrowdStrike provider</a> that simplifies the setup and management of the Falcon platform by automating the provisioning, configuration, and lifecycle management of key CrowdStrike resources, enabling users to deploy and maintain security infrastructure more efficiently. </p>\n\n<h3><strong>Fortinet</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Fortinet, who offer cybersecurity solutions across the cloud, networks, and applications, released two Terraform providers. They released the <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/providers/fortinetdev/fortitokencloud/1.0.0\">FortiTokenCloud provider</a> integrating their FortiToken multi-factor authorization platform into Terraform, and they released the <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/providers/fortinetdev/fmgdevice/1.0.0\">FmgDevice provider</a>, which is used to interact with the device related resources supported by FortiManager. </p>\n\n<h3><strong>JFrog</strong></h3>\n\n<p>jFrog, enables continuous updates through Liquid Software, empowering developers to code high-quality applications that securely flow to end-users with zero downtime. This quarter they released three new Terraform providers. First is the <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/providers/jfrog/distribution/1.2.0\">JFrog Distribution provider</a>, which is used by Terraform to interact with the features from the <a href=\"https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-rest-apis/distribution-rest-apis\">JFrog Distribution REST API</a>. Next they released the <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/providers/jfrog/myjfrog/1.0.0\">JFrog MyJFrog provider</a> allowing Terraform to interact with the features from <a href=\"https://my.jfrog.com/\">MyJFrog portal</a>. Finally, they released the <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/providers/jfrog/mission-control/1.1.0\">JFrog Mission Control provider</a> for Terraform to manage the features from the <a href=\"https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-rest-apis/mission-control-rest-apis\">JFrog Mission Control REST API</a>.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Netlify</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Netlify is a frontend cloud solution for developers to build and deploy digital solutions with modern, composable tooling that works with all modern frameworks.
