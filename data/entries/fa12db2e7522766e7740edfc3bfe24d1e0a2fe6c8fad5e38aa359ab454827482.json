Though still in a nascent phase of tech development, the effort could result in repurposing Starship into a commercial space station, something NASA has a keen interest in because there are no plans for a government-owned research lab in low-Earth orbit after the International Space Station is decommissioned after 2030.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/seven-us-companies-collaborate-with-nasa-to-advance-space-capabilities\">space agency announced last month</a> a new round of agreements with seven commercial companies, including SpaceX. The Collaborations for Commercial Space Capabilities (CCSC) program is an effort established to advance private sector development of emerging products and services that could be available to customers—including NASA—in approximately five to seven years.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956125#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956125&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fa12db2e7522766e7740edfc3bfe24d1e0a2fe6c8fad5e38aa359ab454827482","category":"Tech"}
