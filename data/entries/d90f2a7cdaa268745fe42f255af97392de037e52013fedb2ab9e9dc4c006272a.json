When the agreement between Microsoft and Qualcomm does conclude, it will allow other chip vendors to create machines using Arm Windows, and it may perhaps free up Microsoft to make Arm Windows available on Apple silicon Macs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple silicon Macs do not offer Boot Camp and there is no official Windows support at the current time, leaving ‌M1‌, ‌M1 Pro‌, and ‌M1 Max‌ owners with few options for accessing Windows on their devices. In September, Microsoft said that an Arm version of Windows 11 for Apple silicon Macs <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/arm-windows-m1-macs-not-supported/\">through virtualization or otherwise</a> is not \"a supported scenario,\" so there's a chance that it still won't happen.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple silicon Mac owners who need Windows access can use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/parallels-desktop-native-m1-support/\">Parallels 16.5</a> or later to run Insider Preview builds of Windows 10 and 11 that have been created for Arm hardware, but there are often <a href=\"https://kb.parallels.com/en/128611\">issues to deal with</a>. Parallels continues to be the only solution because Microsoft has made no licensed retail version of Arm Windows available for Apple silicon Macs.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/\">Qualcomm</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/windows/\">Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/22/microsoft-qualcomm-arm-windows-exclusive-deal/\">There's No Windows for Arm Macs Yet Because Microsoft Has Secret Exclusivity Deal With Qualcomm</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/theres-no-windows-for-arm-macs-yet-because-microsoft-has-secret-exclusivity-deal-with-qualcomm.2324499/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=m-sMtioKAoI:BJuqYqRcNp0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=m-sMtioKAoI:BJuqYqRcNp0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d90f2a7cdaa268745fe42f255af97392de037e52013fedb2ab9e9dc4c006272a","category":"Apple"}
