Now, it makes its way to their top-tier Z1 road bike helmet to give it a claimed weight of just 220g in size medium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not the only impressive claim. They also say it has best-in-class ventilation and it’s aerodynamic. So, safe, fast, cool, and light… let’s see how they do it:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-3.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-3.jpg\" alt=\"Lazer Z1 Kineticore helmet padding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-3.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The inside of the shell has a waffle-like grid in the foam, creating crumple zones that can smoosh and smash from various angles. Lazer says this mimics the reduction in rotational impact forces that other systems provide but has the added benefit of being lighter and allowing more airflow. In fact, they say it has 3% more ventilation cooling than if you wore no helmet at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-2.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-2.jpg\" alt=\"Lazer Z1 Kineticore helmet detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-2.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has a ponytail-friendly, height-adjustable rear cradle, which is connected to the…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-7.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-7.jpg\" alt=\"Lazer Z1 Kineticore RollSys helmet adjustment dial\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-7.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-7-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-7-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-7-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-7-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>…RollSys adjustment dial on the top of the helmet for easy fitment.

Zach’s weighed 233g (shown), mine was 235g. That’s slightly more than the 220g claim, which could be due to them being CPSC models for US distribution. CE-approved models are sometimes slightly lighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wore mine with a winter cycling cap underneath, then took it off mid-ride once I warmed up, and it fit well in both cases thanks to its wide range of adjustability. The RollSys is easy to use, I only had to tighten the chin strap slightly to take up some of the slack. It’s a comfortable helmet and fits like their prior Z1, so if you’re a fan, you’ll probably like this one even better.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-10.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-10-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Lazer Z1 fit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-10-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-10-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-10-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-10-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-10-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Kineticore-road-helmet-actual-weight-10.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>Zach has to run the chinstrap looser than advised to prevent it from digging into his neck. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The only caveat to that could come from the straps. While I had no issues with the positioning of the straps and ear cradles, Zach had a different expereice. Zach says he typically has to adjust the ear cradles forward on most helmets with adjustable straps, and since the new Z1 is not adjustable, the straps sit too far back on his head. The resulting fit causes the chinstrap to dig into his neck, and the front parts of the ‘V’ strap bow out when he moves his head. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you typically don’t need to mess with the ear cradle adjustment on your helmets, you probably won’t notice. But for those with a similar fit to Zach, or those who just prefer adjustable ear cradles, this might not be the one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://lazersport.us\">lazersport.us</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lazer-z1-kineticore/\">Lazer Z1 KinetiCore Road Helmet Goes Ultralight, Ultra-Everything</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d8aa41be66e103e8b4b1e2853056d85a77f9d631a10a6a5513f704090fec43ce","category":"Cycling"}
