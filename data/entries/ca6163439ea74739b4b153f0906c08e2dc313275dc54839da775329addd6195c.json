They love to source ingredients, cook food, eat, clean, and then wash up. Others delight in taking pictures, then editing and archiving their photos. I know a few who relish planning a route, going for a ride, and then cleaning and maintaining their bikes. I’m envious of these people because with most things I only enjoy the first half, which means the latter half often feels like labor.</p>\n<p>For example, I love to ride bikes, but I do not love to wash bikes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-15.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-15.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>It feels like nonsense to wash them regularly since they just get dirty again, and in my experience, if the dirt doesn’t fall off on its own accord, leaving a bike outside for a couple of hours in the more or less constant UK rain usually does the job. Living in the UK is like living in a washing machine, one of only a handful of appliances that have saved humanity significant labor reliably over time.</p>\n<p>My aversion to washing bikes changed recently through a perfect storm of riding offroad in the UK though the winter, and being forced to buy a new(er) car that’s less than three decades old, costs almost as much as a bike, has seatbelts, and most critically, transports a child – so it needs to be kept clean(ish). It feels more like an Uber than my own personal car, and often, I lose it in car parks because I forget that I drive an Uber.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-12.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>With no real experience of washing bikes beyond having worked in bike shops over a decade and a half ago, and with no practice since, I looked for a cheap, portable solution that I could use out of the back of the Uber. I started off using up the gallon of <a href=\"https://shop.hopetech.com/13337/products/shifter--single-1-litre-bottle.aspx\">Hope Shifter cleaning solution</a> that I bought ten years ago when I had an account with Hope, to make up the minimum order for free shipping, which had sat neglected in my garden since, and a cheap pressurized garden sprayer with a hand pump from a local garden center.</p>\n<p>I had no intention of becoming a fetishist, or even for the bike to be properly clean. Just a token effort at cleanliness aiming to appease my family that at least I’d tried before ruining the Uber. I dug out some kind of weird <a href=\"https://peatys.com/products/peatys-bog-brush\">Peaty’s Products toilet brush</a> that someone had bought me as a gift a while back which had also remained unused, sprayed the stuff on with a mister, that had the dregs of window cleaning fluid in it, made a cup of tea, came back and sprayed the bike down with water in the garden sprayer to wash it off. To my amazement, it worked.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-18.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Evolution of a Cleaning Creep</h3>\n<p>The terrifying part, however, was when I saw my bike being clean… I liked it. So I got into the habit of carrying this sprayer and a box with the shifter spray, brushes, a little tube of lube, and a rag in the car whenever I went mountain biking or looking for gravel in the winter. It was oddly satisfying to come home with a clean bike and not get mud all over the house.</p>\n<p>The car was a gateway drug to being a bike cleaning person and the Hope Shifter was great – it minimized the effort of cleaning, and was easy enough to use, although it left a whitish residue where I didn’t wash it off properly, and it never left the drivetrain properly clean, just clean-ish, which is cleaner than my drivetrain has ever been before. It’s a pretty safe product, but it’s also powerful enough to remove the mystery product that came with my bike that protects the anodised finish.</p>\n<p>I’d bumped into Jon from <a href=\"https://fenwicksbike.com\">Fenwick’s</a> a few times at bike shows where he’d tried to convince me that cleaning bikes was a thing to do, but in a relaxed way. Jon has an air about him which suggests that he’s also kind of surprised that washing bikes with his goo actually works, which engaged me enough for that conversation to dither into actually interesting stuff like graphic finishing, and what would happen if you drank a liter of undiluted bike cleaning fluid.</p>\n<p>When I bumped into Jon again at COREbike, a trade show for distributors in a middle-of-the-road hotel in Towcester, the kind of pampas grass hell that fosters depressing parties for retiring swingers. I told Jon that I’d become a pervert – one of those people who sometimes washes their bike after a ride – and asked what was so special about his bike cleaning goo.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Essentially, it boiled down to being super safe and environmentally responsible. Jon and his twin brother James are both super chill. They’re not high-strung bike cleaning creeps like I’ve become. They’re past that. They don’t clean their own bikes unless they are unrideably filthy. They’re pushers more than they are users. We chatted as they demonstrated some products in a matter-of-fact way before sending me home with a bag of things to try.</p>\n<h3>How Fenwick’s Works</h3>\n<p>After a particularly sloppy ride out around the North Downs that left me with a sore stomach and my bike covered in claggy agricultural runoff, I rode home. After washing myself and my clothes, I was too tired to deal with the bike, so I left the shit on the bike to form a crust. Two weeks later I had a crack at cleaning it with a detergent so mild that Jonathan claims that his mum uses it for washing dishes.</p>\n<p>I followed the instructions and sprayed the main stuff all over the bike fairly indiscriminately, waited a few minutes and then gave it a brush. Not so long ago wattle and daub was the favorite building method of the British people. They built the houses that they lived in out of literal shit, mashed together with clay, crushed chalk, and natural fibers, and spread it over a woven hazel framework.</p>\n<p>Wattle and daub houses managed to resist the elements and provide shelter for people for thousands of years, and I can’t see that there’s really any difference in the daub that they’d have used and what my bike was covered in, so it was super surprising that the super mild, non corrosive detergent got a lot of it off in the first hit. Since I’m now a sanitized clean freak (and my bike stank like a dead cow’s rotting asshole), I went over it a second time and made it really quite clean before having a go at the drive train.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-20.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The drivetrain is where it all got a bit more interesting, as the cleaning product for that (which I assume is harsher somehow) is like a shaving foam that you spray all over the chain and into one hand. That’s right; the foam is so mild that the applicator is your hand. Having covered the chain, I wiped the rest of the foam off my hand onto the cassette and let it do its thing. Somehow, it didn’t dry my hands or further ruin my already shrunken Sealskinz gloves.</p>\n<p>I waited a few minutes, during which I played fetch with Moondog, who ate a good amount of the foam before losing his ball to a particularly vicious seagull, who picked it up and dropped it out to sea, where a gaggle of gulls squabbled over the little rubber ball, taking turns trying to swallow it whole.</p>\n<p>I left Moondog barking out to sea like a metronome in vain, and took the coarse sponge Fenwick’s had supplied, with a slot down the middle for the chain, slotted it on, and spun the cranks a few times with my hand. The foam shrank and turned a brownish gray, then I sprayed it off with the garden sprayer. The barking had gotten pretty irritating by this point, so I chased Moondog around with the sprayer a bit before even really examining the clean drivetrain.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-28.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-28.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Fenwick’s Verdict</h3>\n<p>The Fenwick’s bike cleaner that I used on the frame did not shift the dirt quite as easily as the Hope Shifter and required some scrubbing with a soft brush; however, the tradeoff is that it didn’t wipe off all the “shiny shine shine.” After I’ve finished the remaining 24 liters of concentrated Hope Shifter, I can make a better call on whether regular washing with Hope Shifter has any bearing on the lifespan of components or finishes.</p>\n<p>You can expect that review in about 15 years if I take the current rate of consumption forwards, unless there’s a spillage when I’m mixing a batch from concentrate. The <a href=\"https://fenwicksbike.com/product/foaming-chain-cleaner/\">Fenwick’s chain cleaner foaming aerosol</a>, however, was kind of incredible, and has become a product that going forwards I’ve started to use on a semi-regular basis.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-10.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-10.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-19.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-19.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-19.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-19.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-21.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-21.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-21.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-21.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Drivetrain cleaning and re-lubricating has in my eyes always been a greasy dirty process, with lots of scrubbing, or using one of those weird tools with a bath of degreaser that clips onto the chain. Little bits of slightly dissolved dirty grease always flicks onto my clothes, and I am only able to maintain a degree of respectability as a civilized member of society once I’ve given up on cleaning chains.</p>\n<p>With the Fenwick’s shaving foam, I more or less don’t even need to touch anything if I’m careful. The chain and cassette get a practical level of clean with little to no effort, and I’ve gotten into the habit of lubricating my chain after cleaning rather than before I ride, allowing for better penetration of the lubricant between links and less stuff sticking to the chain when I ride.</p>\n<p>As the weather improves, I’ve relaxed quite a lot with the bike cleaning. There’s something pleasantly filmic about a soft dusty layer coating a well-traveled bike. However, I have kept up with cleaning my drivetrain after every 1000 miles or so. There’s a noticeable improvement in shifting performance and perceived efficiency, and it might make things last longer.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-27.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Fenwicks_Bike_Wash_Review-27.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Super gentle</li>\n<li>Can be used for washing anything filthy, not just bikes</li>\n<li>Non-toxic</li>\n<li>Biodegradable</li>\n<li>Cleans drivetrains without a mess</li>\n<li>Surprisingly didn’t make Moondog sick</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bike wash needs a tiny bit of actual scrubbing</li>\n<li>Spray bottle could be more robust – mine broke</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/fenwicks-bike-wash/\">The One Time I Washed My Bike with Fenwick’s</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"ca6163439ea74739b4b153f0906c08e2dc313275dc54839da775329addd6195c","category":"Cycling"}
