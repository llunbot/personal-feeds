Hurley said he obtained the details from an anonymous source who previously shared accurate details about the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/17/beats-studio-buds-plus-launch/\">Beats Studio Buds+</a> earbuds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/beats-studio-pro.jpg\" alt width=\"1868\" height=\"1051\" />\r<br />\nHurley's source claimed that the Studio Pro will be available in four colors, including Black, Navy, Sandstone, and Deep Brown, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/09/apple-working-on-new-beats-studio-pro/\">leaked images from @aaronp613</a> show the headphones will have a very similar design as the Beats Studio3. The headphones are said to feature a USB-C port for charging instead of micro-USB, upgraded microphones, optimized sound profiles, a new carrying case, and support for Android features such as Fast Pair and Find My Device. The headphones will retain a 3.5mm headphone jack, the source added.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike the Studio Buds+, it is likely that the Studio Pro will also feature improved active noise cancellation and longer battery life.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAn early <a href=\"https://www.smartteck.co.uk/apple-beats-studio-pro-wless-black.html\">reseller listing</a> indicates that the Studio Pro will retail for around â‚¬399 in Europe, which would be the same price as the Studio3. This suggests the headphones will likely cost around $349.95 in the U.S. at launch. The Studio3 are equipped with Apple's W1 chip, but it's unclear which chip the Studio Pro will use.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEvidence of the Studio Pro already <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/09/apple-working-on-new-beats-studio-pro/\">emerged in macOS 13.4 code</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/20/beats-studio-pro-fcc-database/\">in an FCC filing</a> in recent weeks, but Beats has yet to officially announce them. The headphones would serve as a long-overdue update to the Studio3, released in 2017. More information should become available closer to the rumored July 19 launch date.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats-studio-pro/\">Beats Studio Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/28/beats-studio-pro-release-date-rumor/\">Apple's New Beats Studio Pro Expected to Launch in July With USB-C, Improved Sound, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-new-beats-studio-pro-expected-to-launch-in-july-with-usb-c-improved-sound-and-more.2394456/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ce36f1ebb010d5cc1738ee2c62225f4cb2f5e7948f1675e604473bce33fb9181","category":"Apple"}
