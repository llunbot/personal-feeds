Getting OS updates installed on end user devices should be easy. After all, it’s one of the simplest yet most impactful ways that every employee can practice good security. On top of that, every MDM solution promises that it will automate the process and install updates with no user interaction needed. Yet in the real world, it doesn’t play out like that. Users <em>don’t</em> install updates and IT admins <em>won’t</em> force installs via forced restart.</p>\n\n<p>With Kolide, when a user’s device — be it Mac, Windows, Linux, or mobile — is out of compliance, Kolide reaches out to them with instructions on how to fix it.  The user chooses when to restart, but if they don’t fix the problem by a predetermined deadline, they’re unable to authenticate with Okta.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kolide.com/daringfireball\">Watch Kolide’s on-demand demo</a> to learn more about how it enforces device compliance for companies with Okta.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/31/kolide\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8723b4bf567d3a83373176bc42b7beb71ac420d7b5845dc48f89f33cd77719b7","category":"Tech"}
