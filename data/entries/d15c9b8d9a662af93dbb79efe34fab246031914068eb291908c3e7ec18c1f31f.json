Despite agreeing to a settlement, Apple denied any wrongdoing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>\"Loop Disease\"</h2>\r<br />\nIn an internal document, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> in May 2018, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/05/04/apple-aware-of-iphone-7-mic-issue-ios-11-3/\">acknowledged a microphone issue affecting some iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models</a>:<blockquote>Some customers might report that after they've updated to iOS 11.3, the microphone on their iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus doesn't work and the speaker button is grayed out when they make or receive a call.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Symptoms:</strong>\r<br />\n- The speaker button is grayed out during calls\r<br />\n- Other people are unable to hear the customer on cellular or FaceTime calls\r<br />\n- If a customer plays back a video or voice memo that they've made after installing iOS 11.3, there is no sound</blockquote>The defect is informally known as \"Loop Disease\" online.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs far as an underlying cause, the class action lawsuit alleged that \"the materials used in the ‌iPhone‌'s external casing are insufficient and inadequate to protect the internal parts,\" eventually resulting in the audio chip losing electrical contact with the logic board due to \"flexion\" of the device's external casing during regular use. It's unclear how many iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus units were affected in total.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple initially said its service providers could request a \"warranty exception\" for affected iPhones, which resulted in free repairs for at least some customers, but that abruptly ended in July 2018 after <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/07/17/apple-ends-free-oow-iphone-7-mic-repairs/\">Apple deleted the document</a>. Afterwards, some customers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/17/iphone-7-microphone-defect/\">had to pay an out-of-warranty fee of around $300</a> in the U.S. for a fix.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/iphone-7-lawsuit-settlement-payments/\">Former iPhone 7 Owners Begin Receiving Up to $349 Following Lawsuit</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/former-iphone-7-owners-begin-receiving-up-to-349-following-lawsuit.2448886/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d15c9b8d9a662af93dbb79efe34fab246031914068eb291908c3e7ec18c1f31f","category":"Apple"}
