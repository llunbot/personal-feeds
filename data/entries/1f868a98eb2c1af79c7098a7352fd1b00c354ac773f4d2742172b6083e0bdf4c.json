{"title":"WhatsApp: The World’s Default Communication App","link":"https://www.engadget.com/how-whatsapp-became-the-worlds-default-communication-app-144520113.html","date":1711740768000,"content":"\n<p>Pranav Dixit, writing for Engadget:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“WhatsApp is kind of like a media platform and kind of like a \nmessaging platform, but it’s also not quite those things,” Surya \nMattu, a researcher at Princeton who runs the university’s Digital \nWitness Lab, which studies how information flows through WhatsApp, \ntold Engadget. “It has the scale of a social media platform, but \nit doesn’t have the traditional problems of one because there are \nno recommendations and no social graph.” </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, WhatsApp’s scale dwarfs nearly every social network and \nmessaging app out there. In 2020, WhatsApp <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-whatsapp-2-billion-users.html\">announced</a> it \nhad more than two billion users around the world. It’s bigger \nthan iMessage (1.3 billion users), TikTok (1 billion), Telegram \n(800 million), Snap (400 million) and Signal (40 million.) It \nstands head and shoulders above fellow Meta platform Instagram, \nwhich captures around 1.4 billion users. The only thing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-still-growing-amid-metas-year-of-efficiency-222320433.html\">bigger \nthan WhatsApp</a> is Facebook itself, with more than three \nbillion users . </p>\n\n<p>WhatsApp has become the world’s default communications platform. \nTen years after it was acquired, its growth shows no sign of \nstopping. Even in the US, it is finally beginning to break through \nthe green and blue bubble battles and is reportedly one of Meta’s \nfastest-growing services. As Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/technology/mark-zuckerberg-whatsapp.html\">told</a> \nthe New York Times last year, WhatsApp is the “next chapter” for \nthe company. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anecdotally, I’m seeing more American usage of WhatsApp too. Putting aside the (deeply misguided, IMO) antitrust arguments about iMessage, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/01/19/cue-imessage-android\">Apple’s decade ago decision to eschew an iMessage client for Android</a> might be proven to have been a mistake the old-fashioned way: through market forces.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/29/whatsapp\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1f868a98eb2c1af79c7098a7352fd1b00c354ac773f4d2742172b6083e0bdf4c","category":"Tech"}
