What’s long for one person isn’t necessarily long for the next.</p>\n<p>When you <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/beginners-cycling-tips-25-essential-pieces-of-advice-for-new-cyclists/\">start off cycling</a>, managing to ride for an hour brings satisfaction. An experienced cyclist’s idea of endurance might be an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/audax/\">audax</a>, which could be 200km or 1,000km long.</p>\n<p>Scientifically speaking, endurance in cycling is a physiological state in which the body works aerobically by using oxygen.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿Zone</th><th>Name</th><th>Heart rate (% of threshold HR)</th><th>Power (% of threshold power)</th><th>Typical duration</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Active recovery</td><td>Less than 68%</td><td>Less than 55%</td><td>n/a</td>        </tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Endurance</td><td>69-83%</td><td>56-75%</td><td>3+ hours</td>        </tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Tempo / Sweetspot</td><td>84-94%</td><td>76-90%</td><td>20 mins to 1 hour</td>        </tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Threshold</td><td>95-105%</td><td>91-105%</td><td>10 to 30 mins</td>        </tr><tr><td>5</td><td>VO2 max</td><td>More than 106%</td><td>106-120%</td><td>3 to 8 mins</td>        </tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Anaerobic capacity</td><td>n/a</td><td>More than 121%</td><td>30 seconds to 3 mins</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p>In the six-zone Coggan <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/training-zones/\">training zones</a> model, the first five zones fall under endurance. We only hit our Anaerobic Capacity when <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-improve-your-sprinting/\">sprinting</a> flat-out in the highest zone.</p>\n<p>Many people will often refer to long, zone 2 rides or base training as endurance training. But, given zones 1 to 5 are technically endurance, this is inaccurate.</p>\n<p>All kinds of cycling, including<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-get-started-at-track-cycling/\"> track cycling</a>, involve some endurance, according to Bryan, who runs <a href=\"https://coachpav.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Coach Pav Cycle Coaching</a>.</p>\n<p>He says in strict scientific terms, endurance is any action that isn’t sustained and uses the body’s stored energy source (ATP) for fuel, such as an explosive squat.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, he’ll often use a more colloquial definition to define endurance: “Training at a low intensity at least aerobically for an extended period of time”.</p>\n<p>Bryan says endurance cycling is easier to define as an ability. “It’s a component of fitness that determines how long you can ride a bike for,” he explains.</p>\n<h2>Who needs endurance?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon von Bromley riding a road bike at Maindy velodrome\" title=\"Simon von Bromley riding a road bike at Maindy velodrome\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Although they need little endurance, even track riders benefit from endurance training.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The short answer is almost anyone who rides a bike.</p>\n<p>Anyone who wants to ride further than before needs cycling endurance. For example, if the longest ride you’ve done is two hours and you’ve entered a Gran Fondo that will take you seven hours, working on cycling endurance helps bridge the gap in duration.</p>\n<p>For events shorter than an hour, such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/10-steps-to-your-best-ever-time-trial/\">time trials</a> or criterium races, Bryan says endurance isn’t all that important.</p>\n<p>“Four-to-five hour rides won’t be the best use of your time if you’re targeting such events, although that’s not to say they won’t benefit you,” he adds.</p>\n<p>That’s because a secondary benefit of endurance training is it develops capabilities required for higher-intensity riding (more on this later).</p>\n\n<h2>How to improve your endurance as a cyclist</h2>\n<p>A high-volume training regime is the surest way to build cycling endurance. But by training and fuelling more effectively, it’s possible to increase your stamina on the bike without riding hundreds of kilometres a week.</p>\n<h3>Ride more</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Two cyclist on a 400km 3 day tour\" title=\"400km on £400 bikes - 06\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A gradual increase in weekly volume boosts physical and mental stamina.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Joseph Branston / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Angus Young, ultra-endurance cyclist and winner of the 2,000km Pan Celtic race in 2021, says increasing your training volume (the number of hours you ride a week) is the key to better endurance.</p>\n<p>“There is no secret sauce or magic interval set,” he explains.</p>\n<p>“The most crucial metric that you should be looking at is time in the saddle each week.</p>\n<p>“If you can increase that slowly without overdoing it, then you will improve your endurance.”</p>\n<h3>Lower the intensity</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"A tech gallery from Tour De Lunsar, Sierra Leone between April 26-30, 2023 Osman Trumpet Kalokoh riding for Lunsar Cycling Team A The Team USA bikes used by the team were purchased using a crowdfunding campaign.

Mitochondria use oxygen to create ATP, the body’s rocket fuel, so for endurance athletes, the more mitochondria the merrier.</p>\n<p>Time in zone 2 also leads to increased capillarisation (the density of capillaries) in slow twitch muscle fibres. This brings more oxygen-rich blood to the muscles, a key factor in improving <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/vo2-max/\">VO2 Max</a>, and improves your ability to remove metabolic byproducts from the muscles, some of which cause fatigue.</p>\n<p>Additional benefits of zone 2 include increased stroke volume (the amount of blood a beat of the left heart ventricle pumps out) and higher FatMax – the highest intensity at which you use mainly fat for fuel.</p>\n<p>By sparing the muscle’s finite supply of glycogen, a high FatMax can help you <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-avoid-bonking-on-a-bike-ride/\">avoid bonking on a bike ride</a>.</p>\n<p>Staying in zone 2 is easiest if you <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-train-with-power/\">train with power</a>. But if you don’t have a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">power meter</a>, use a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-choose-a-heart-rate-monitor/\">heart rate monitor</a> to keep your heart rate in zone 2 or lower.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, maintain a conversational pace and consistent pressure on the pedals whenever possible.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Garmin Edge 1040 Solar ride summary.\" title=\"garmin-edge-1040-solar-2\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Average power can mask prolonged spells above or below your target range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>To avoid straying out of your target zone into zone 3, which will make your long rides too hard, Bryan recommends focusing on the time you spend in each training zone instead of average power.</p>\n<p>He says: “Outside, average power drops on descents so you might try to increase it by spending time in a higher zone.</p>\n<p>“On a descent, press lap, disregard the descent, then press lap again when you’re ready to restart at your target intensity.”</p>\n<p>As a result, the average watts on your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">bike computer</a> screen better reflects your actual effort.</p>\n<p>When you do have to leave zone 2, it’s better to go into zone 1.</p>\n<p>“If you’ve spent a large chunk of time above zone 2, in a polarised approach that’s an absolute nightmare because you’ll have ridden too much above your target,” adds Bryan.</p>\n<h3>Tailor your training</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus Sentier 29 hardtail mountain bike\" title=\"Vitus Sentier 29 - 13\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The polarised endurance training method eschews moderate-intensity riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>However, Bryan says lots of long, slow riding isn’t the only way to improve your cycling endurance.</p>\n<p>The threshold training method, popularised by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/trainerroad/\">TrainerRoad</a>, that prescribes lots of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/sweetspot-training/\">sweetspot</a> riding, works well if your time is limited.</p>\n<p>You won’t get much adaptation from five to eight hours of riding in zone 1 and 2, but you will see more by spending some but not all the time at 88 to 93 per cent of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/what-is-ftp-and-why-it-matters-for-cyclists/\">FTP</a>, according to Bryan.</p>\n<p>This approach can cause excessive fatigue in some athletes. Bryan might suggest they do less zone 3 training and try <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/fasted-training/\">fasted training</a> in zone 1 or 2, which some coaches believe maximises training stimulus.</p>\n<p>Bryan recommends riders with a medium amount of time, such as 8 to 12 hours a week, adopt a similar approach but add one longer ride per week. This creates a pyramidal training intensity distribution, where the blocks of the pyramid represent time spent training at different intensities. The wide base is low intensity, the narrower middle is threshold and the peak is higher intensity.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SAN SEBASTIAN, SPAIN - MAY 14: A general view of Marlen Reusser of Switzerland - Green points jersey, Demi Vollering of The Netherlands and Team SD Worx - Yellow leader jersey, Katarzyna Niewiadoma of Poland and Team Canyon//SRAM Racing, Liane Lippert of Germany, Évita Muzic of France, Annemiek Van Vleuten of The Netherlands and Movistar Team, Loes Adegeest of The Netherlands and Team FDJ - SUEZ, Olivia Baril of Canada and UAE Team ADQ, Blanka Vas of Hungary and Team SD Worx, Veronica Ewers of The United States and Team EF Education-TIBCO-SVB compete in the breakaway during the 2nd Itzulia Women 2023, Stage 3 a 114.8km stage from Donostia - San Sebastian to Donostia - San Sebastian / UCIWWT / on May 14, 2023 in Donostia - San Sebastian, Spain.

Approximately 80 per cent of sessions are dedicated zone 1 and 2 riding, with 20 per cent at VO2 Max-level intensity and above.</p>\n<p>Proponents of polarised training say it reflects the way professional endurance athletes train. Studies have linked polarised training to greater increases in VO2 max.</p>\n<p>However, Bryan cautions that amateur athletes may find polarised training too rigid. For example, you would miss out on fast <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-ride-in-a-group/\">riding in a group</a> because it involves <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/why-you-should-build-tempo-riding-into-your-training-this-spring/\">tempo training</a> in zone 3.</p>\n<p>In order to continue fast group riding, you should drop weekly training hours to 12 or so in a more pyramidal structure, according to Bryan.</p>\n<h3>Eat more carbs</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Styrkr energy products\" title=\"Bikeradar_270223_dc1082\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Dual-carb products, containing fructose and maltodextrin, help you absorb more carbohydrate.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Consuming more <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/the-best-carbs-for-cycling-what-to-eat-and-when/\">carbohydrates</a> on long training rides and during events improves endurance and recovery, says Dr Tim Podlogar, a nutritionist at <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour </a>team Bora-Hansgrohe.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to athletic performance, carbohydrate and energy availability are the keys.</p>\n<p>“But you can’t eat carbohydrates all the time or you won’t stay in an energy balance and you’ll put on body mass, which we don’t always want,” he says.</p>\n<p>An amateur rider’s energy intake of 3,000 calories, for example, is much smaller than the 5,000 calories a pro might consume.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Complete guide to winter road cycling\" title=\"gluten_free_sushi_olive_magazine-1469599274171-1ithv4zj1jx76-a85e58d\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> WorldTour riders eats tons of white rice, which is simple to digest and carb-rich.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>However, Dr Podlogar adds: “Carbohydrate becomes more important for amateurs because you only have 3,000 calories to work with.</p>\n<p>“The carbohydrate required in order to replenish their glycogen stores might be pretty similar because we can extinguish them in 1.5 hours of riding.</p>\n<p>“Going relatively low in fat can be more important for amateurs than professionals, because they have more room to work [in terms of their calories budget].”</p>\n<p>Bearing in mind Dr Podlogar’s advice, we need to take on energy, ideally in readily digestible forms such as glucose, on rides longer than one-and-a-half to two hours.</p>\n<p>Amateurs will rarely require the vast amounts of carbohydrates (up to 180g per hour) pros ingest during hard Grand Tour stages.</p>\n<p>But we should aim for 60 to 90g per hour on four- or five-hour rides and potentially up to 120g if going longer, particularly on consecutive days, according to Bryan.</p>\n<h3>Prepare your gut</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The best flapjack and breakfast loaf recipes for cyclists\" title=\"ultimate_flapjack_breakfast_bar_recipes-1467977699275-l0t19yzgq1d1-41341a2\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> They aren’t joking when they say ultra-endurance cycling is an eating contest.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Olive Magazine</i></span></div>\n<p>Even 60g an hour can seem a lot – that’s roughly two of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-energy-bars/\">best energy bars</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/6-delicious-flapjack-and-breakfast-bar-recipes-to-boost-your-riding-energy/\">homemade flapjack</a> or two of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/best-energy-gels-for-cycling/\">best energy gels</a> every 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>The gut needs to be trained in the final stages of your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-training-plan/\">cycling training plan</a> – something Bryan believes many un-coached athletes fail to do.</p>\n<p>“It can take 12 weeks for the gut to adapt to digest this amount of food for hours on end.</p>\n<p>“It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that if your gut’s handled it one year, it will handle it the next.</p>\n<p>“But your gut will see reversibility,” he adds.</p>\n<p>In the final three months of training, Bryan recommends trialling your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/the-ultimate-sportive-nutrition-guide/\">event day nutrition</a> on long rides, even if the intensity is lower than your target pace.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Food station at the Fred Whitton sportive\" title=\"The Fred Whitton | This is hardcore -
