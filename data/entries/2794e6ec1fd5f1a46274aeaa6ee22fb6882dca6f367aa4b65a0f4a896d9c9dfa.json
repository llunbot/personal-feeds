Amazon is back today with fresh markdowns on even more models of the 2021 iPad, including the 64GB Wi-Fi iPad, available for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$269.00</strong></a>, down from $329.00, which is an overall second-best price for this tablet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/ipad-purple-image.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

Any discounts on this iPad have been pretty rare so far in 2023, so Amazon's sale today (which includes both the Space Gray and Silver color options) is a solid purchase for those who have been waiting for a deal on the iPad.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9FPHY6%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$60 OFF</div>64GB Wi-Fi iPad for $269.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, we're now tracking a new sale on the 256GB Wi-Fi iPad, available for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G96TFF7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\"><strong>$399.00</strong></a>, down from $479.00. This one is another second-best price, and it's only about $10 higher than the previous low that we tracked last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G96TFF7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$80 OFF</div>256GB Wi-Fi iPad for $399.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLastly, there is one cellular model on sale: the 256GB cellular iPad is down to <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G97CV82%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\"><strong>$529.99</strong></a> in Silver, from $609.00. You'll need to add the iPad to your cart and head to checkout in order to see a coupon worth $9.01 added to your order, which will knock the tablet down to this all-time low price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><strong>Note: You won't see the deal price until checkout.</strong></em></div>\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G97CV82%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$79 OFF</div>256GB Cellular iPad for $529.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor even more iPad deals, head to our full <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-deals/\">Best Deals guide for iPad</a>.
