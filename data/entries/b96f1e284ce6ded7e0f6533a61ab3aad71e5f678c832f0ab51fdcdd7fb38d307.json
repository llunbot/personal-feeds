Priced at $10.99 per month, the Basic option includes all of the music benefits of Spotify like ad-free playback, but without added monthly audiobook listening time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/General-Spotify-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1407\" />\r<br />\nThe $11.99 standard Premium Individual plan that Spotify offers includes ad-free playback and 15 hours of audiobook listening time per month from a catalog of more than 250,000 titles. Until now, Spotify did not let customers opt for a cheaper plan that did not include audiobook access, as it was automatically bundled in the lowest-tier plan.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpotify in June <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/spotify-price-increase/\">raised its base price</a> from $10.99 to $11.99 to \"bring users the best experience,\" but with the new Basic plan, customers who don't want to use the audiobook feature can get the prior $10.99/month price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpotify's new $10.99 per month option is on par with the $10.99 price of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, so Spotify is no longer $1 more expensive than ‌Apple Music‌ for base music subscription service.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been no changes to the prices of other plans. Duo is priced at $16.99, and Family is priced at $19.99. Spotify also has a $9.99 per month plan that offers 15 hours of audiobook listening with ad-supported music.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/spotify-cheaper-premium-plan/\">Spotify Launches Cheaper $10.99/Month Premium Plan Without Audiobooks</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-launches-cheaper-10-99-month-premium-plan-without-audiobooks.2429791/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b96f1e284ce6ded7e0f6533a61ab3aad71e5f678c832f0ab51fdcdd7fb38d307","category":"Apple"}
