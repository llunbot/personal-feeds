Anker’s MagGo Magnetic Charging Station is different. It’s compact, cute, and clever, and today it’s 30 percent off as well: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-MagGo-Magnetic-Charging-Station/dp/B0C9Q94MZ8?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the Anker MagGo Magnetic Charging Station, Qi2 Compatible 15W Ultra-Fast MagSafe Wireless Charger for $70</a>, a savings of $30 and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spherical charging station has a large magnetic front to attach to an iPhone 12 or later, as well as several ports around the back, including 2 USB-C and 2 USB-A ports, and 3 120V AC outlets for charging a laptop or plugging in a clock or some other gadget. It’s available in black or white so it’s sure to match any aesthetic in your room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This charging station will fast-charge an iPhone 12 or later either magnetically (thanks to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2128673/what-is-qi2-is-qi2-iphone-wireless-charging-better-than-magsafe.html\">Qi2 support</a>) or via one of the 67W USB-C ports. Anker says the charging station features an AI-powered algorithm with a “32-bit processor that outperforms standard 8-bit samplers for optimal charging.” It also has “patented double-layer insulation technology” for “rapid heat dissipation and faster charging.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been using an older version of the MagGo charging station in my dining room without Qi2 for years and love the design and speed. It looks great, keeps cable clutter to a minimum, and fills up all of my devices quickly. I’ve never seen it this cheap either, so go grab one before this limited deal ends.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2e0cd8ed3e8b220d837fc38bbffca67b6b997261b17894984d8871d4a61d8b6a","category":"Apple"}
