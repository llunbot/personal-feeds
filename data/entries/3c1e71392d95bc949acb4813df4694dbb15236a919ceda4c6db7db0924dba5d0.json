However, a new indoor bike called Tiltbike from UK outfit Muoverti nevertheless gives us some hope that we’ll see something like that from someone because built into one of its levers is — for real — a joystick!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will our prayers ever be answered? We chat about some other tech news items in this week’s show — and answer a bunch of Ask a Mechanic questions, as usual — but really all we care about is the turtle shells.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/c74257e0-deda-49fc-b2ea-551819ac9483.gif\" />     SUBSCRIBE TO THE ‘NERD ALERT’ PODCAST</strong><br />Never miss an episode.
