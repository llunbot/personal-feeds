However, ‌iOS 18‌ allows you to change this behavior, thanks to a new Camera setting.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere's how to enable audio playback during video recording in ‌iOS 18‌:\r<br />\n<ol>\r<br />\n  <li>Open the Settings app on your ‌iPhone‌.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Camera</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Tap <strong>Record Sound</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Toggle on the <strong>Allow Audio Playback</strong> option.</li>\r<br />\n</ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/allow-audio-playback-camera-setting.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnce enabled, your ‌iPhone‌ will no longer automatically pause audio when you start recording video in the Camera app. Bear in mind that when playing audio through your ‌iPhone‌'s speaker while recording, the audio will be captured in mono. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis new option provides more flexibility than the previous workaround of using QuickTake in Photo mode, which allowed for continued audio playback but at a lower video quality. With ‌iOS 18‌, however, you can now enjoy full Video mode quality while maintaining your desired audio playback.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/record-iphone-audio-playback-videos-ios/\">iOS 18: Capture iPhone Audio Playback When Shooting Video</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-capture-iphone-audio-playback-when-shooting-video.2437936/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c7f089f4ba81aefcf5a9d1dcc471459b1d140cc1c6a095ea8897f825a0f77540","category":"Apple"}
