During his previous visit to Beijing, Cook acknowledged the specific regulatory requirements, stating that Apple was \"working hard\" to bring Apple Intelligence to Chinese consumers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe company has been gradually rolling out Apple Intelligence features in the US and elsewhere since October, with things like Writing Tools and enhanced Siri using a combination of on-device processing and its Private Cloud Compute servers, along with OpenAI's ChatGPT for more complex queries. But if Apple can't secure approval for its own AI models in China, it may need to rely on Chinese partners' LLMs to host AI features on devices sold there.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, the regulatory uncertainty could delay the launch of Apple Intelligence in China until \"well into the second half of 2025\" or later, unless Apple adopts a flexible approach involving multiple Chinese partnerships to expedite approval.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChina represents 17% of the company's revenue but saw an 8% decline in sales over the past year. The company faces increasing competition from Huawei, which has already integrated its own AI features into its latest smartphones.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/26/apple-intelligence-complext-approval-china/\">Apple Intelligence Faces Complex Approval Process in China</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-faces-complex-approval-process-in-china.2444025/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3a6e0d6c281cd81fb4e277ae40c0976ee0cd02094f7f376293052d61a59e480a","category":"Apple"}
