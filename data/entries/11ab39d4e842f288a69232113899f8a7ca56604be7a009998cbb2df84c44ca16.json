Four months later, Netflix has finally gotten around to adding it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reddit user <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/125vu9w/ad_tier_works_now_on_apple_tv_update_230/&amp;xcust=1-1-1678903-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Websgeisti</a> spotted that the Netflix Basic with Ads tier works on Apple TV after the Netflix app is updated to version 2.3.0. Netflix <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/30/netflixs-ad-supported-plan-comes-to-apple-tv-after-months-of-delay/&amp;xcust=1-1-1678903-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> to TechCrunch that the cheaper Netflix tier is now available on the Apple TV. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Apple TV wasn’t the only platform that didn’t allow the ad-supported tier, Netflix appears to be slowly rolling out support. After the latest update, it appears that the Chromecast, PlayStation 3, and Windows apps still don’t support the Basic with Ads plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Netflix Basic with Ads subscription costs $6.99/£4.99 per month while the Basic plan without ads costs $9.99/£6.99. Subscribers see about five ads per hour depending on the show being watched. The ads can last from 30 to 75 seconds. Additionally, some shows, including “The Office” and “Arrested Development,” are not available with this budget tier. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get Netflix Basic with Ads </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can subscribe to the Netflix ad-supported plan on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://help.netflix.com&amp;xcust=1-1-1678903-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix’s website</a>. You don’t have to be a new Netflix subscriber to sign up for the Basic with Ads plan—existing subscibers can switch to the cheaper option as well. On an Apple TV, you’ll need to update the Netflix app to the latest version (version 2.3.0 or later) to watch shows with the Basic with Ads plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How much is Netflix? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are four subscription plans for Netflix: Basic with Ads there are ad-free Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers. Here’s how much each plan costs and what you get for your money: </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Basic with Ads</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Price: $6.99/£4.99 a month </li><li>Ads: Includes ads</li><li>Content: Some major third-party shows and films are missing from this tier. </li><li>Streaming quality: HD (720p)</li><li>Streams: No simultaneous streams </li><li>Downloads: No downloads</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Basic</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Price: $9.99/£6.99 a month </li><li>Ads: No ads</li><li>Content: Access to the entire library of TV shows and movies. </li><li>Streaming quality: HD (720p)</li><li>Streams: No simultaneous streams </li><li>Downloads: Can only download content on one phone or tablet</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Standard</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Price: $15.49/£10.99 a month </li><li>Ads: No ads</li><li>Content: Access to the entire library of TV shows and movies. </li><li>Streaming quality: Up to 1080p</li><li>Streams: Two simultaneous streams </li><li>Downloads: Two devices can register for and store downloads</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Premium </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Price: $19.99/£15.99 a month</li><li>Ads: No ads</li><li>Content: Access to the entire library of TV shows and movies. </li><li>Streaming quality: Ultra High Definition (UHD) 4K streaming (not every show and film is available in 4K)</li><li>Streams: Four simultaneous streams </li><li>Downloads: Four devices can register for and store downloads</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can create up to five profiles across all of the plans but note that Netflix is cracking down on password sharing among multiple households.
