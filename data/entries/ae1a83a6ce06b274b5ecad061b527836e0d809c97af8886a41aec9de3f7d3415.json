They're Intel's only processors with memory integrated onto the CPU package; the only ones with a neural processing unit that meets Microsoft's Copilot+ performance requirements; and the only ones with Intel's best-performing integrated GPUs, the Intel Arc 130V and 140V.</p>\n<p>Today, Intel <a href=\"https://game.intel.com/us/stories/performance-update-for-intel-arc-140v-and-130v-built-in-gpus/\">announced</a> some updates to its graphics driver that specifically benefit those integrated GPUs, welcome news for anyone who bought one and is trying to get by with it as an entry-level gaming system. Intel says that version 32.0.101.6734 of its graphics driver can speed up average frame rates in some games by around 10 percent, and can speed up \"1 percent low FPS\" (that is, for any given frames per second measurement, whatever your frame rate is the slowest 1 percent of the time) by as much as 25 percent. This should, in theory, make games run better in general and ease some of the stuttering you notice when your game's performance dips down to that 1 percent level.</p>\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/intel-lunar-lake-gpu-update.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/intel-lunar-lake-gpu-update.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/intel-lunar-lake-gpu-update-640x360.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/intel-lunar-lake-gpu-update-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/intel-lunar-lake-gpu-update-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/intel-lunar-lake-gpu-update-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/intel-lunar-lake-gpu-update-384x216.jpg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/intel-lunar-lake-gpu-update-1152x648.jpg 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/intel-lunar-lake-gpu-update-980x551.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/intel-lunar-lake-gpu-update-1440x810.jpg 1440w\" />\n      Intel's performance numbers for its new GPU drivers on a laptop running at the \"common default power level\" of 17 W.\n        Credit:\n          Intel\n      \n<p>Intel's performance comparisons were made using an MSI Claw 7 AI+ using an Arc 140V GPU, and they compare the performance of driver version 32.0.101.6732 (released April 2) to version 32.0.101.6734 (released April 8).
