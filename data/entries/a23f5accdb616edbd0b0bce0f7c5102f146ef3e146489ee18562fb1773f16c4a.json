The timing of the outage is particularly tough for the company, coming amid Thursday's launch of the remastered <em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy</em>.</p>\n<p>Rockstar officially noted the outage <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1458878159047340032\">in a support tweet</a> Thursday afternoon, merely saying that \"services for the Rockstar Games Launcher and supported titles are temporarily offline for maintenance. Services will return as soon as maintenance is completed.\" Fourteen hours later, the company gave <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1459097578445111297\">a brief update</a>, saying, \"We thank you for your patience and understanding as we continue to work on restoring services for the Rockstar Games Launcher and supported titles.\" That same update also appears <a href=\"https://support.rockstargames.com/\">on Rockstar's support site</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-games-launcher-keels-over-and-all-its-pc-games-are-down/\">PC Gamer reports</a> that the launcher is loading in offline mode for players who have previously launched specific games on the service. Multiplayer titles like <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption Online</em> remain inaccessible on PC for the time being, however. And for those launching recently downloaded titles like the <em>GTA Definitive Trilogy</em> for the first time, a required online authentication check will fail during the outage.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812593#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812593&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a23f5accdb616edbd0b0bce0f7c5102f146ef3e146489ee18562fb1773f16c4a","category":"Tech"}
