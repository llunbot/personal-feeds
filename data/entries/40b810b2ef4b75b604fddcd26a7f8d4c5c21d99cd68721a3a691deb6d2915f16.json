There will also be some enhancements to photos in the form of AI-based editing, but none of those features will impress people who have used AI in Adobe Inc.'s apps for the last several months.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman added that while Apple will mainly rely on on-device processing to support its AI features, it will also deliver them via the cloud in data centers that contain high-end Apple silicon chips designed for the Mac. He also noted that a ChatGPT-like chatbot will be noticeably absent from Apple's upcoming AI features. Apple executives are said to have admitted that they're \"playing catch-up\" internally. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's inaugural push into AI is widely expected to be revealed as part of previews of its next-generation software updates at WWDC, which begins on June 10.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/\">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/19/ios-18-to-use-ai-to-summarize-notifications/\">iOS 18 to Use AI to Summarize Notifications, Add to Calendar, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-to-use-ai-to-summarize-notifications-add-to-calendar-and-more.2426866/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"40b810b2ef4b75b604fddcd26a7f8d4c5c21d99cd68721a3a691deb6d2915f16","category":"Apple"}
