This design would be a substantial upgrade over the current ‌iPhone SE‌, which features curved edges, a 4.7-inch display, a Home Button with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a>, and large bezels.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-SE-4-front-render.jpg\" width=\"1068\" height=\"529\" />\r<br />\nThe new ‌iPhone SE‌ is apparently 147mm tall, 71.5mm wide, and 7.7mm thick. This is almost identical to the size of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>, which is 146.7mm tall, 71.5mm wide, and 7.8mm thick.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-SE-4-rear-render.jpg\" width=\"1068\" height=\"529\" />\r<br />\nOverall, the images corroborate <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/\"><em>MacRumors</em>' reporting from last year</a>, which revealed that the next-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ would largely re-use the design of the ‌iPhone 14‌, including ‌Face ID‌ authentication and a 6.1-inch OLED display, but with a single rear camera, an Action button, and a USB-C port. The device is expected to launch next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-SE-4-USB-C-render.jpg\" width=\"1068\" height=\"529\" />\r<br />\n<em>91Mobiles</em> previously revealed accurate CAD renders of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/iphone-13-pro-thicker-and-larger-rear-camera/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/16/iphone-14-pro-cad-renders-no-notch/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a>, but its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-watch-series7-cad-larger-display/\">Apple Watch Series 7 designs</a> were ultimately incorrect.
