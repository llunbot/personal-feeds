While the YT’s easy-going nature and impressive all-round credentials make it a surefire recommendation, so too do the Nukeproof’s composure and stability when things really kick off, especially on seriously steep tech.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The One-Sixty is eager to attack the trail at full speed and provides masses of confidence in the process.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Olly Bowman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>“But it was the Merida’s proportions, supportive suspension and electrifying ride feel that finally clinched it.</p>\n<p>“The fun we had riding some of the gnarliest trails around Dolceacqua, skimming over jagged rocks and drifting loose turns, meant it had to be the winner.”</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension/merida-one-sixty-6000-review/\">Read Rob’s full review of the Merida One-Sixty 6000</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Enduro Bike of the Year contenders</h3>\n<p>We’ll be bringing you full reviews of all eight Enduro Bike of the Year contenders over the next month.</p>\n<ul><li>Bird Aeris 9</li>\n<li>Canyon Strive CFR Underdog</li>\n<li>Cotic RocketMax Mullet/Silver SLX</li>\n<li>Giant Reign 1</li>\n<li>Merida One-Sixty 6000</li>\n<li>Nukeproof Mega 297 Carbon Elite</li>\n<li>Vitus Sommet 297 AMP</li>\n<li>YT Capra 29 Core 4</li>\n</ul><section><div>\n        \n<h4>Meet the tester | Rob Weaver</h4>\n<p>BikeRadar and <em>MBUK</em>’s technical editor-in-chief, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/robinweaver/\">Rob Weaver</a>, has years of racing and testing experience so knows what makes a good enduro rig.</p>\n<p>But how do you separate good from the very best? For Rob, it’s all about balance and compromise.</p>\n<p>Enduro riding and racing takes in all kinds of terrain and gradients. To tackle it confidently, safely and at pace, your bike needs to feel balanced, composed and stable.</p>\n<p>Essentially, that equates to suspension that keeps the tyres glued to the trail but prevents the bike feeling like a bucking bronco when things get rough.</p>\n<p>Of course, balance doesn’t just come from the suspension, but the geometry, too. The right mix should enable it to feel like to a downhill bike when gravity is on its side and pedal back up the hill when the time comes.</p>\n<p>The parts package needs to offer good value for money, too. There’s always going to be an element of compromise, but the smart brands will spend their budgets wisely.</p>\n<p>Over a 12-week period, all of the bikes in this category were put through their paces on a wide variety of trails and tracks to ascertain their strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>The bikes were ridden back-to-back, as well as in varying orders to see how each one felt at the start and end of the day, once rider fatigue had set in.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n            <div>\n            <div>\n                <div><img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/BOTY-MTB-26-5bed97c.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=556,556\" srcset=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/BOTY-MTB-26-5bed97c.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=1025,1025 1025w, https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/BOTY-MTB-26-5bed97c.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=820,820 820w, https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/BOTY-MTB-26-5bed97c.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=615,615 615w, https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/BOTY-MTB-26-5bed97c.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=410,410 410w, https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/BOTY-MTB-26-5bed97c.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=205,205 205w\" width=\"556\" height=\"556\" alt=\"Headshot of Rob Weaver\" title=\"Headshot of Rob Weaver\" /></div><div><figcaption>Olly Bowman / Our Media</figcaption></div></div>\n        </div>\n    </section><h2>Electric Mountain Bike of the Year – Orbea Wild M-Team</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Our Electric Mountain Bike of the Year 2023 top three: the Orbea Wild M-Team, Whyte E-180 RSX MX and Santa Cruz Bullit CC S.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Olly Bowman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ol><li>Orbea Wild M-Team</li>\n<li>Whyte E-180 RSX MX</li>\n<li>Santa Cruz Bullit CC S</li>\n</ol><p>Possibly the biggest area of growth, and the quickest in terms of tech changes, must be in the world of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Our mix of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-mountain-bikes/\">eMTBs</a> for 2023 is more exciting than ever – and more expensive, too, with pricing ranging from a not inconsiderable £7,499.95 right up to £10,000.</p>\n<p>All of these bikes are designed to be incredibly capable, but to win, they needed to balance ground-hugging suspension with a bit of pop and liveliness.

The difference between the cheapest bike and the most expensive is just £100, with RRPs ranging from £900 to £1,000.</p>\n<p>At this price, we thought it’d be wise to stick with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hardtail-mountain-bikes/\">hardtails</a>, too, because we don’t think there are eight sub-£1k full-suspension machines out there that are worthy of a true head-to-head test.</p>\n<p>Our testers were looking for value for money – which doesn’t necessarily mean being the cheapest. Instead, brands need to have spent their budget wisely, on a quality frame and the components that matter most – along with a cohesive, capable and, ideally, versatile overall package.

Its relatively low weight and central rider position aid acceleration on the climbs, and despite its size, getting air is still a breeze.</p>\n<p>“It’ll make a great partner for riders of varied experience, and represents exceptional value for money, too.
