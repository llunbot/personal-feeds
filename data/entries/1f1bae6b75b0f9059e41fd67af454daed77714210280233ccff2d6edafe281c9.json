Longtime leather saddle maker, Brooks England, was putting the iconic B72, back into production. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the story went live, Brooks reached out and asked if I’d like to review one of those saddles. I thought it would look pretty sick on my Rivendell <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rivendell-gus-boots-willsen-hillibike-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Gus Boots Willsen</a>, so I accepted. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-saddle-in-th-sun.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-saddle-in-th-sun-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Brooks B72 First Look and Install saddle in th sun\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-saddle-in-th-sun-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-saddle-in-th-sun-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-saddle-in-th-sun-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-saddle-in-th-sun-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-saddle-in-th-sun-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-saddle-in-th-sun.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The B72 is made for an upright riding position, say for the casual tourer, or riding around and runnin’ errands in the city. It’s also a very good fit for classic bicycles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the birth of mountain biking, it was <em>the</em> popular saddle choice of those early dirt daredevils flying down Mt Tamplapais in the late 70s, clinching the B72’s spot in MTB history. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt that it would be a great fit for my mountain bike (ATB?), so let’s get it installed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Impressions of the Brooks B72</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b72-and-b17-shape-differences-e1709139855969.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"441\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b72-and-b17-shape-differences-e1709139855969-800x441.jpeg\" alt=\"Brooks B72 First Look and Install b72 and b17 shape differences\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b72-and-b17-shape-differences-e1709139855969-800x441.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b72-and-b17-shape-differences-e1709139855969-297x164.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b72-and-b17-shape-differences-e1709139855969-120x66.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b72-and-b17-shape-differences-e1709139855969-768x424.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b72-and-b17-shape-differences-e1709139855969.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Shapeshifter… B72 (L) and B17 (R)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was the shape of the B72. Its shape was quite different than my B17’s shape. the B17 Special is my “go-to” saddle, and I use it on all of my bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On my Gus Boots, the B72 will be replacing the B17, so shape is important. The width of my B17 Special is 175mm as compared to the B72’s width of 205mm. The length difference is also substantial, with the B72 being a lot shorter at 260mm to the B17’s length at 275mm. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b72-weight-e1709140090177.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"544\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b72-weight-e1709140090177-800x544.jpeg\" alt=\"Brooks B72 First Look and Install b72 weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b72-weight-e1709140090177-800x544.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b72-weight-e1709140090177-297x202.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b72-weight-e1709140090177-120x82.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b72-weight-e1709140090177-768x522.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b72-weight-e1709140090177.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>B-72 weighs in at 578g</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b17-weight-e1709140076650.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"557\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b17-weight-e1709140076650-800x557.jpeg\" alt=\"Brooks B72 First Look and Install b17 weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b17-weight-e1709140076650-800x557.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b17-weight-e1709140076650-297x207.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b17-weight-e1709140076650-120x84.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b17-weight-e1709140076650-768x535.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-b17-weight-e1709140076650.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>B-17 weighs in at 550g</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like the difference in length between the saddles won’t be as crucial in my riding as the width. Will it be a lot less comfortable getting off the back of the B72 on steep descents, than the B17? We’ll see. There is a slight weight difference (28g) between the B72 (578g) and B17 (550g).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the B72 would look cool with the B17 Special’s style of hand-hammered brass rivets as opposed to the more standard tubular steel rivets that came on the B72. But the black powder-coated rails and frame look great on the B72. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Installing the Brooks B72</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Installation would be easy enough, although a little more involved than a standard Brooks saddle install. The reason is, that the Brooks B72 is a suspended saddle with springs, so it utilizes dual rails. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-B17-in-the-clamp.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"603\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-B17-in-the-clamp-800x603.jpeg\" alt=\"Brooks B72 First Look and Install B17 in the clamp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-B17-in-the-clamp-800x603.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-B17-in-the-clamp-297x224.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-B17-in-the-clamp-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-B17-in-the-clamp-768x578.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-B17-in-the-clamp.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Regular single rail</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-Saddle-sandwich-adaptor-installed.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"603\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-Saddle-sandwich-adaptor-installed-800x603.jpeg\" alt=\"Brooks B72 First Look and Install Saddle sandwich adaptor installed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-Saddle-sandwich-adaptor-installed-800x603.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-Saddle-sandwich-adaptor-installed-297x224.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-Saddle-sandwich-adaptor-installed-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-Saddle-sandwich-adaptor-installed-768x578.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-Saddle-sandwich-adaptor-installed.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Double rail (with adaptor)</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that I had to get the <a href=\"https://www.brooksengland.com/en_us/sandwich-seat-adapter.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brooks Sandwich Seat Adaptor</a> to install the saddle correctly.

It’s a bit of a game, but if you use it wisely you should be able to do the top and the underneath of the saddle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hint: a little goes a long way… seriously. Just apply it with your fingers and let it sit and dry. Once the saddle starts to dry, you’ll see leather take a matte look on top which means the Proofide is dry. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-waiting-for-proofide-to-dry.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"603\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-waiting-for-proofide-to-dry-800x603.jpeg\" alt=\"Brooks B72 First Look and Install waiting for proofide to dry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-waiting-for-proofide-to-dry-800x603.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-waiting-for-proofide-to-dry-297x224.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-waiting-for-proofide-to-dry-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-waiting-for-proofide-to-dry-768x578.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-waiting-for-proofide-to-dry.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Almost dry </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the whole saddle looks matte, get a cotton rag and buff it clean. Done. Leave the underside of the saddle alone.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you use the packet, you’ll need to buy yourself another lil’ tub for the yearly touch-ups. It doesn’t just waterproof your saddle, it keeps the leather supple and speeds the “break-in” time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Ride on the B72</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve only had an opportunity to ride the saddle once, on one of my favorite loops. It’s a loop that I often use for testing and reviews. I’ve been riding this 12-mile loop for more than 25 years, so it’s easy for me to tell when something I do to my bike has changed or different, for better or for worse. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-rear-of-saddle.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-rear-of-saddle-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Brooks B72 First Look and Install rear of saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-rear-of-saddle-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-rear-of-saddle-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-rear-of-saddle-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-rear-of-saddle-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-rear-of-saddle-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-rear-of-saddle.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While riding the flat parts and climbing the few long climbs of this loop, I could feel the springy difference when compared to my B17. It was comfortable while lollygagging down the trail, doing its job soaking up some of the smaller bumps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I found the biggest difference between the B72 and B17, was where I thought I would – the shape of the saddle. I found it very uncomfortable to “get off the back of the saddle” on the few steep, technical descents that my loop offers. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Form over Function</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than comically bowing my legs out to get off the back of the saddle, the B72 operated well on the trail. It is a very comfortable saddle, and like all of the Brooks saddles I’ve owned, will only get comfier with time. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-back-side.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-back-side-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Brooks B72 First Look and Install back side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-back-side-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-back-side-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-back-side-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-back-side-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-back-side-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-back-side.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll be riding the B72 a ton to get the final result of this review. I’m looking forward to breaking it in and getting to know it. And while aesthetics are important, there is an expectation of performance, even from a looker like the B72. Form and function can live together and don’t need to be mutually exclusive.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And although the B72 is very aesthetically pleasing, as of writing this article the B17 is still my “go-to” saddle</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-inner-springs.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-inner-springs-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Brooks B72 First Look and Install inner springs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-inner-springs-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-inner-springs-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-inner-springs-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-inner-springs-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-inner-springs-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brooks-B72-First-Look-and-Install-inner-springs.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The B72 looks amazing mounted on my Gus Boots Willsen, there’s no denying that. For anyone who is restoring an older mountain bike or even an old Klunker-type MTB, the Brooks B72 saddle would be a wise choice, popping your build to the next level. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out all of the saddles and goodies Brooks England has to offer at the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.brooksengland.com/en_us/\">BrooksEngland.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-impressions-rereleased-brooks-b72-saddle/\">First Impressions: Rereleased Brooks B72 Checks in with Wide Perch, Double Rails</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1f1bae6b75b0f9059e41fd67af454daed77714210280233ccff2d6edafe281c9","category":"Cycling"}
