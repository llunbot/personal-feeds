{"title":"The Six Colors 2022 Apple Report Card","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/02/apple-in-2022-the-six-colors-report-card/","date":1675962865000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is the eighth year that I’ve presented this survey to a\nhand-selected group. They were prompted with 12 different\nApple-related subjects, and asked to rate them on a scale from 1\nto 5 and optionally provide text commentary per category. I\nreceived 55 replies, with the average results as shown below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I took my time reading this, and recommend you do too. What a wonderful tradition. It really does capture the general consensus regarding the state of the company and its platforms and services.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll post my full report card as a column tomorrow, but here are my observations after reading everyone else’s quoted remarks and grades:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>There’s seemingly universal agreement that the iPad continues to suffer from a lack of attention and focus. The iPhone remains the iPhone: boring perhaps, but boring by being consistently great. The Mac is going strong in all regards, particularly hardware. The iPad, though, breeds frustration.</p></li>\n<li><p>Stage Manager feels like a bust, both on Mac and iPad. But it’s the iPad where it was needed. Window management and side-by-side multitasking are solved problems on the Mac — for decades. Getting into “the flow” on iPad remains out of reach.</p></li>\n<li><p>Apple’s hardware game is stronger than its software game.</p></li>\n<li><p>AirPods are awesome.</p></li>\n<li><p>HomeKit remains frustrating and confusing.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(Also, yes, in my comments praising the M2 MacBook Air and its midnight colorway in particular, I forgot about the black MacBooks sold from 2006–2011. Still it’s been a long time since Apple offered a dark laptop.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/02/09/six-colors-2022-apple-report-card\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"829e9c633155cf381c0b0d209334a9b913931f16314f573fb9e3057a28febbc8","category":"Tech"}
