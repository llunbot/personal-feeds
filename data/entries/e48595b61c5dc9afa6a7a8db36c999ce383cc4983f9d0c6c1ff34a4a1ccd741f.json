Even when it is cold and dark, there is something magical about riding the streets of London while most of the city sleeps. Every light is green. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only other traffic is the occasional delivery van and a handful of cabs cruising like sharks in search of scraps. I skirt round the back of King’s Cross and down a deserted side street to find the underground parking at St Pancras station.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/flanders-roubaix-cycling\">Big Ride: Flanders vs Roubaix</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cobbles-lions-flanders-cycling\">Big Ride: Cobbles and lions in Flanders</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/roubaix-cobbles-cycling\">Big Ride: Wind, rain and pavé in Roubaix</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>In a perfect world I would be taking my bike with me on the Eurostar so I could simply ride off at the other end in Belgium. Sadly, despite the growth in demand for sustainable travel, Eurostar only offers limited options for carrying bikes on journeys to the Continent, so I’m obliged to leave my bike in the car park beneath the station. At least there is a proper lockup and it’s free of charge.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Flanders\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As I wrestle with my padlock, I can’t help musing on the lost opportunity to promote the concept of train-bike holidays in favour of fly-drive (I even wrote to Eurostar about it, but reply came there none). Imagine pedalling to your local station, popping your bike in the guard’s van, catching a series of trains to a European destination and then pedalling the final stretch to your holiday villa. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds great to me, but current infrastructure and transport company intransigence renders it almost impossible. Which is a shame – it would certainly help on our current mission: to ride an 80km loop of Flanders and get back home in the same day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Welcome on board the Eurosnore</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Flanders\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Speeding through the darkness on the first Eurostar of the day.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>6:16am. The Eurostar train is quiet at this time. Bleary-eyed passengers slide into their seats and quickly fashion coats into makeshift pillows in an attempt to reclaim a couple of hours of lost sleep before the arrival in Brussels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My ride companion for the day, Will, has arrived fully prepared in bibtights, a commitment to time-saving efficiency that I find impressive. After a flask of tea and pot of muesli, I too join the assembled snoozers as we slip smoothly through the darkness, awakening later to the sight of mist over brown fields somewhere in northern Europe.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-04-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Flanders\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-04-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-04-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-04-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Our route starts outside the Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen (Tour of Flanders Museum) in Oudenaarde.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>9:12am. Arrive in Brussels (Euro time) and stumble to the nearest coffee bar while searching for details of our connecting train. It’s only when we are standing on a suspiciously empty platform with no train in sight that we realise the announcements in Flemish have been warning us of a platform change, resulting in a headlong dash to the other side of the station. For once, I’m happy I don’t have a bike with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>9:39am. Safely on the train to Oudenaarde. I note that Belgian trains actively encourage the taking of bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>10:26am. Arrive at Oudenaarde in the heart of Flanders and make the 15-minute walk to the main square, off which sits the cafe-cum-bike-shop l’Amusette. Patrick, the friendly owner, is ready with our pre-booked hire bikes, a pair of steel Cinellis. Pedals on, seat height adjusted, bike computer fired up, bags dumped. Time check: 11:10am. We’re off.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Out of the blue, into the red</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re following the 80km ‘Blue’ route, as suggested by the Cycling in Flanders website. It starts in Oudenaarde and meanders around the surrounding roads in a small-scale tribute act to the great race. Such is the dedication to cycling in these parts there are even colour-coded signs at all the main junctions.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Flanders\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Arriving at the top of the Oude Kwaremont – no KoMs were broken on this day.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The first 10km follows a wide, traffic-free river path that proves to be the perfect warm-up. We need it – the day has started cold and still, with mist hanging over the trees and a slate-grey sky. Just how they like it in Flanders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A left turn takes us through a housing estate with a strange mix of crumbling Flemish farmsteads and super-modern cubist homes, beyond which lie the bleak, bare fields that are so recognisable to any fan of the spring Classics. The occasional faint outline on the tarmac of a scrawled MVDP or WOUT is a further reminder that these are hallowed roads.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Flanders\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>A rusting bicycle marks the start of the Oude Kwaremont.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s not long before we round a corner to be greeted by a line across the road bearing the legend ‘Strava: Start’. We’re on the Oude Kwaremont, the longest climb of the day, but not the hardest. The gradient averages just over 4% and maxes at 11%, with cobbles that are fairly benign. Over its 2.2km length it goes easy, hard, less hard, really easy, hard<em>ish</em>, and finally easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, that’s for us. If we were pros at the Tour of Flanders we would have to tackle this climb three times, with the final ascent coming just 16km from the finish, so anyone thinking about a win needs to see the Oude Kwaremont as an opportunity to drop any last rivals. For them, the climb goes hard, harder, insanely hard, bleeding from the eyes.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-07-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Flanders\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-07-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-07-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-07-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-07-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-07-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-07-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/big-ride-flanders-07.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Approximately 1km into the climb, the gradient eases as it passes through the village of Kwaremont.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A quick right-left brings us onto Ronde van Vlaaderenstraat, a flat street where we pass billboards with images of famous past winners such as Eddy Merckx, Johan Museeuw and Fabian Cancellara. On the tarmac, a few metres apart, are painted the names of every Flanders winner – men and women – since the race started in 1913. As we pass, I try to work out how many more years the race will have to go before they run out of road to paint the names.

This is the infamous scene of Danish rider Jesper Skibby’s fall in 1987 where he was almost crushed by the following commissaire’s car, leading to the climb being removed from the Tour of Flanders for 15 years on the grounds of being too dangerous.

The rest of the ride is mostly flat so we get into two-up time-trial mode and race the setting sun back to Oudenaarde in order to return our bikes to Patrick before he shuts up shop at 5pm.

Journey time was two hours, arriving (with time difference) at 09:12. We caught the 09:39 to Oudenaarde (watch out for last-minute platform changes) and arrived at 10:26. It was then a 15-minute walk to the town centre to the bike hire shop and start of the ride. Afterwards, we caught the 18:33 train back to Brussels to get the 20:55 Eurostar, which got us back to London at 21:57. Our Eurostar tickets were £103 per person, while the Belgian train was £25 return. Visit eurostar.com and raileurope.com for details and tickets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bike transport</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eurostar’s policy for bikes is that on trains to Paris bikes can only be taken if they are disassembled and boxed. Eurostar <em>will</em> take assembled bikes on trains to Brussels but only at certain times of day: 09:01, 13:01, 15:04 outbound; 07:56, 08:52, 12:52, 14:52, 17:56 return. Those times wouldn’t work for our one-day challenge so we opted for bike hire in Oudenaarde.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bike hire</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>L’Amusette is a cafe and bike shop near the Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen, which can rent you a steel Cinelli Nemo Tig road or gravel bike for around €50 (£42) a day. You can also rent helmets, bike computers and such like, and owner Patrick will be happy to discuss optimum tyre pressures for getting up the Koppenberg when it has been raining. See <a href=\"https://lamusette.cafe/\" target=\"_blank\">lamusette.cafe </a>for details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thanks </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many thanks to Patrick at l’Amusette for our bike rentals and advice.
