Combining a waterproof bar roll, accessory mount, and external storage all into one sleek package is an impressive feat. This is going to be a journey through options and configurations with plenty of side quests exploring the many details of this system, so buckle up.</p>\n<p>The Bar Bag System is available in two flavors: flat bar and drop bar. The drop bar system has a unique and innovative closure system to maximize space between the drops. I don’t do much riding on drop bar bikes, and I find the closure system, though innovative, raises a red flag for me over its possibility of failure. So this review is going to focus on the flat bar flavor of the Tailfin Bar Bag System and my thoughts will carry over to the drop bar system with the exclusion of the closure mechanism.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-5.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Tailfin Flat Bar Bag System Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Two Sizes:\n<ul>\n<li>Small 5.8 to 14.7 L(+2.7 L pocket)</li>\n<li>Large 8.7 to 18.9 L (+3.5 L pocket)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fabric: 210D Hypalon and 210D Diamond Ripstop</li>\n<li>Weight:\n<ul>\n<li>Clamp: 181 g</li>\n<li>Small: 604 g</li>\n<li>Large: 679 g</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>100% waterproof (purge valve for packing)</li>\n<li>X-Clamp mount</li>\n<li>Bar Clamp allows for accessories to be mounted</li>\n<li>Price: $315 (small) $330 (large)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-28.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-28.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-27.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-27.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Clamp</h3>\n<p>Let’s start where the bag meets your bike. Tailfin’s hinged bar clamp attaches on either side of the stem and is native to 35 mm bars with shims down to 31.8 mm. If you need something smaller than that, you’ll have to be crafty. From the clamp, we move toward the mounting/accessory bar – this bar and the accompanying mount “stop” are fully adjustable for whatever angle or Ergostem cosplay you might need. I’m no fan of T25 bolts in places where I may want a ball head Allen if things get tight, but I had no issue during my review period. Importantly, the mount and accompanying crossbar space the bag off of your bars, keeping it clear of your housing and hoses. Gone are the days of foam spacers to keep everything from getting squished.</p>\n<p>There are a variety of accessories that can be mounted to this bar. Tailfin offers mounts for GoPro standard, Garmin, and Wahoo cycling computers, and an additional piece of 22.2 mm bar for anything else. Each end of the crossbar has a threaded end to mount these attachments, or a few can be mounted in the middle of the bar via a hinged clamp. Experienced bikepackers know how precious bar space is for accessory mounting, and the Tailfin system moves those accessories from your handlebars, above your bag, in one convenient and adjustable space. The Tailfin system incorporates all the utility of something like a Bar Yak system seamlessly into their handlebar system.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-25.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Bag</h3>\n<p>Moving from the clamp to the main bag, we notice the Tailfin X-Clamp, a locking lever that clamps around the crossbar of the clamp and rests on a secondary hook that is also adjustable. The X-Clamp is mounted to an aluminum inner structure that gives the bag some shape and rigidity. Imagine a slimmed-down version of the <a href=\"https://www.salsacycles.com/products/exp_series_anything_cradle_35mm\" target=\"_blank\">Salsa Anything Cradle</a>.</p>\n<p>One detail that sticks out to me on the Tailfin bag is the stretchy pockets. While the front pockets are a no-brainer for extra storage, I love the small stretchy pocket on the bottom of the bag. This was a feature I first noticed on early Pa’lante backpacks, though its origin might lie elsewhere. This lower pocket was a perfect spot for my ground tarp or extra layers as I shed them throughout a ride. The front pockets offer a few spaces for organization and a surprising amount of volume when needed. Tailfin claims 3.5 L of extra space and I never got near that full capacity. Since all the exterior pockets are mesh, these are great places to dry wet gear or clothing.</p>\n<p>The dual-entry dry bag holds a whopping 19 L when rolled down appropriately. This allowed for plenty of space for a majority of my gear. This style of dry bag is tried and true and works just as expected on Tailfin’s version of a classic.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-24.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-24.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>On the Trail</h3>\n<p>As anyone who has ridden with a handlebar roll can tell you, they only work as well as you pack them. While the Tailfin system leans on the bar clamp and internal structure of the bag to reduce the need for careful stuffing, some attention to tensioning the roll closures of the bags is still necessary. When packed and rolled with care, the bag does not sag or flop around while on the trail.</p>\n<p>I found the clamp and its accompanying parts to work flawlessly. Once I had the angles and bag orientation set, I never had an issue with the clamp or bag slipping from its position. The clamp and mounting bar offer a wide range of adjustability depending on the use. On my touring bike, I had the bag slung low and close to my head tube, but on my full suspension, I was able to keep the bag high away from my tire due to the suspension. In each situation, the bag was secure.</p>\n<p>I loved being able to stash layers and snacks in the stretchy pockets during the day without having to open the main dry bag to access my stuff. Having even a small amount of organization is welcome on what is typically just a single large stuff sack. The stretch pockets, while not weatherproof, provided plenty of extra storage and organization for much-needed items during a long day of bikepacking.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-3.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-3.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-4.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-4.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>What I Liked</h3>\n<p>The Tailfin Handlebar bag system is just that, a complete system; bag, bar mount, and accessories all in one clean package. Tailfin has distilled many ideas from across the bikepacking world, and that system works really well. The bag held its shape well when packed and was never floppy or saggy on the trail. The stretch mesh pockets are a great feature for expanded storage and quick access while preserving the waterproof nature of the main dry bag. I was impressed by just how much I could fit in the bag and then additionally stash in the mesh pockets.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-10.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>What I Did Not Like</h3>\n<p>While the bag only incorporates one zipper that I could complain about, my next biggest fear is just how complex the whole bag is. I quick count reveals about 30 parts, including all the hardware on the handlebar bag system. While I had no issue with my system during the review, many of these small parts are potential points of failure, and the sheer number and specificity of those parts give me pause.</p>\n<p>The fabric on the non-drive side of the roll has started to abrade, creating a few small holes. With waterproof fabrics, there is always the consideration of weight vs durability, and I feel like Tailfin has balanced the two as well as can be expected. This abrasion is due to my laying the bike down, and the desert is a rough place for any fabric.</p>\n<p>This is going to be granular, but when the tension strap on the front mesh pockets is pulled and locked fully closed it is almost impossible to unstrap. This led me to always leave a bit of a looped “tail” so I had something to grab when it was released. I think the sizing of this strap could probably use a second look.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-23.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-23.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Rolling Up</h3>\n<p>The Tailfin Handlebar Bag System is as intricate as it is impressive. While the amount of hardware gives me pause, the adjustability and stability afforded by all the engineering is notable. If you value an all-in-one solution for your handlebar bag system, the Tailfin may be for you. The price is steep, but there are a lot of storage and accessory solutions wrapped into the system.</p>\n<p>If you are a smaller rider and bag clearance is minimal, the security and adjustability of the Tailfin system will be rather appealing. Being 6’ tall, I rarely have to consider this, but even on my full-suspension bike, I needed to keep the bag as high as possible to avoid my tire. If your setup requires very specific clearances, then the Tailfin system may be for you.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-20.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Austin Killips’ Take</h3>\n<p>The Tailfin handlebar bag, like other fancy gizmos and doodads on my bike that I want to call useless but can’t because I secretly cling dear to them, is an object that generates intrigue from passersby. It’s pouring rain, and the off-duty lifty at the top of the mountain wants to know how waterproof the bag is. My housemate wants to know if the pockets are actually that helpful. My dear friend and host gives it a curious, cursory look-over upon its arrival in the mail. The Bar Bag System does little to refute his belief that Tailfin is the Apple of the bikepacking world.</p>\n<p>While integrating the functionality of a handlebar accessory mount is a nice innovation that I was excited to utilize, I couldn’t help but ask, <em>Why do I need or want this object? Is the amount of time that could be saved by the admittedly nifty mounting lever enough to justify the consequences of something going awry?</em></p>\n<p>Despite weeks spent thrashing the bag and mount on technical descents during training rides through the Elk Mountains with no issue, I still opted out of using it for my failed Colorado Trail run. The utility calculus was simple and speaks to the exact concerns that Spencer outlined. If this thing breaks somewhere remote, I am fucked.</p>\n<p>While I passed on the mounting system, I do sincerely believe the Tailfin bag itself is a good object and I was excited to affix the bag to my harness mount. Even with the full functionality of the various pockets being limited by the straps and the weight penalty of the mounting hardware plate, it still offers enough quality of life improvements to be worthwhile.</p>\n<p>The air release is a welcome addition. The abundance of pockets allows for an even more considered curation of snack zones. And I’m confident in the waterproofing after spending my afternoons being pelted by the mid-afternoon showers that always dot the late summer blotter in Colorado’s high country.</p>\n<p>The Tailfin Bar Bag System just feels like an over-engineered solution to the admittedly annoying problem of handlebar bags that flop about on descents and washboard roads. Maybe my fears are unfounded, but materials like fabric and foam don’t hide secrets like metal can. Fraying threads and compressed foam help me make informed decisions about how careless I want to be in continuing to use an object. Aluminum doesn’t share these secrets with me, It simply absorbs force until the day comes when it cannot bear the weight of our over-packed bags.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Tailfin_Bar_Bag_System_Review-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The handlebar mount is solid and unwavering</li>\n<li>Mesh expandable storage is convenient and sizeable</li>\n<li>Combines accessory mounts into a bar mount for a clean cockpit with plenty of options</li>\n<li>Two sizes and bar style options</li>\n<li>Lots of adjustability</li>\n<li>Material choices balance weight and durability nicely</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Expensive</li>\n<li>Heavy</li>\n<li>Many small parts create possible points of failure</li>\n<li>Clamping any handlebars smaller than 31.8 mm is complicated</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tailfin-bar-bag-system-long-term-review/\">Tailfin Bar Bag System: Long Term Review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"c1a1e807111f2e0fe1749866a4c42abfe006b908d55e7623e2b621fb26c27120","category":"Cycling"}
