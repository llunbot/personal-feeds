It can generate 1080p videos lasting over a minute and edit videos from written instructions, but it has not yet been released for broad use.</p>\n\n<p>Veo reportedly includes the ability to edit existing videos using text commands, maintain visual consistency across frames, and generate video sequences lasting up to and beyond 60 seconds from a single prompt or a series of prompts that form a narrative. The company says it can generate detailed scenes and apply cinematic effects such as time-lapses, aerial shots, and various visual styles</p>\n<p>Since the launch of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/when-ai-images-were-mind-blowing-early-users-recall-the-first-days-of-dall-e-2/\">DALL-E 2</a> in April 2022, we've seen a parade of new image synthesis and video synthesis models that aim to allow anyone who can type a written description to create a detailed image or video. While neither technology has been fully refined, both AI image and video generators have been steadily growing more capable.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024749#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024749&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"36a8e6128f0a695831a08cf1bd9b6be12d82e570a6c8408ce29d247a9b521774","category":"Tech"}
