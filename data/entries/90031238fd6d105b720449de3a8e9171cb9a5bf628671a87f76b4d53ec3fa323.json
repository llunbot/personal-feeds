While you would probably not immediately answer every text you receive, letting a text you should answer fall through the cracks can result in disruption in your work or personal life. Today I learned a way to prevent that from happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS has a beneficial feature that lets you mark texts you have already read as unread, which serves to remind you to re-read and respond to them at a later time. Even more helpful is the Messages app feature that lets you view all unread texts exclusively and simultaneously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a small caveat in that this feature works only if you are exchanging messages with others who are using their iPhone Messages app with iOS 16 or later. That means if you are messaging someone with an older phone that does not support the most current iOS, you will not be able to mark their texts to you as unread.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some major techniques you can use to mark texts as unread in iOS, as well as and some features in earlier versions of the iPhone operating system that let you achieve a similar result.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3><strong>Tap and hold</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tap-and-hold.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Messages top hold mark unread\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Jackie Dove</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>Launch Messages.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap and hold on the message you want to mark as unread.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When the resulting menu appears, tap on the <em>Mark as Unread</em> command.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This technique also facilitates a related action, which allows you to read a message without ever having to open it, or alert the sender that you’ve seen it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3><strong>Swipe right</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Swipe-right.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"messages siwpe right mark unread\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Jackie Dove</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>Launch Messages.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose a message you want to mark as unread.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Swipe right part of the way and tap the <em>Mark as Unread</em> icon.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This may be the fastest and most efficient way to mark an individual message as unread.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>3.</span>\n<h3><strong>Mark several messages as unread</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mark-messages-as-unread.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Messages mark unread\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Jackie Dove</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>Launch Messages.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap the <em>Edit</em> button at the top left corner of the screen.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose <em>Select Messages</em> from the menu.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap to select any messages you want to mark unread.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>Unread</em> at the bottom of the screen.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>4.</span>\n<h3><strong>View unread messages</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/View-unread-messages.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"VIew unread message ios\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Now that you’ve chosen which messages are marked Unread, you can also view those messages exclusively by enabling the iOS message filtering option.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <em>Settings &gt; Messages</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Under <em>Message Filtering</em>, find <em>Filter Unknown Senders</em> and toggle it on.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Switch back to the Messages app where the Edit button is now the Filter button.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>Filter &gt; Unread Messages</em> to view that list.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>5.</span>\n<h3><strong>Ask Siri</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Ask-Siri.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Unread messages siri\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Jackie Dove</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>You can use Siri to read your unread messages.
