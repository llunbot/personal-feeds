For context, street prices on Fully desks (among others) have steadily risen over the past several pandemic-addled months, so the discounts here don't bring the lowest prices we've ever tracked. Still, for those wanting to adopt a standing desk today, the sale is a good opportunity to save on a few options we like.</p>\n<p>Among the discounted items we've tested and recommended are Fully's <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3D0vYUd\" target=\"_blank\">Jarvis Standing Desk</a> and the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wtHBk7\" target=\"_blank\">Cooper Standing Desk Converter</a>. While the Jarvis isn't our top overall standing desk pick—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/home-office-setup-ideas/5/#h3\" target=\"_blank\">Uplift's V2 desk</a> offers a handful more customization options, though it isn't as accommodating to shorter frames—it's still an appealing choice from both an aesthetic and functional standpoint. The sustainably sourced bamboo top on our test model helps the desk fit in like semi-high-end furniture, classing up the room while making the office feel less office-y. You can also choose from desktops made of laminate, natural wood, and whiteboard materials. Each varies in price, with laminate costing the least, and sustainably sourced natural wood fetching a higher price. And yes, you can use dry-erase markers on the whiteboard top.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812441#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1812441&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d71e8b34dcec5317b2437ff350d9d41522632b1fdae7976704ce991f3a64b049","category":"Tech"}
