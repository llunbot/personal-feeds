I hope you enjoyed a relatively quiet week, because this one will be busier.</p> \n<p>This week, we’re welcoming our customers and partners at the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jacob+Javits+Convention+Center/@40.7575505,-74.0024691,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x89c2584a54a8579d:0xc064d2a3ccac8fb0!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c2596b0b3394a7:0x8461e42130f7d0a6!8m2!3d40.7575505!4d-74.0024691!16zL20vMDdmbnJj?entry=ttu\" target=\"_blank\">Jacob Javits Convention Center</a> for the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/new-york/\">AWS Summit New York</a> on Wednesday, July 10. I can tell you there is a stream of announcements coming, if I judge by the number of AWS News Blog posts ready to be published.</p> \n<p>I am writing these lines just before packing my bag to attend the <a href=\"https://www.communityday.awsugcmr.com/\">AWS Community Day in Douala, Cameroon</a> next Saturday. I can’t wait to meet our customers and partners, students, and the whole AWS community there.</p> \n<p>But for now, let’s look at last week’s new announcements.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last week’s launches</strong></span><br /> Here are the launches that got my attention.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a> Access Grants now integrate with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/\">Amazon SageMaker</a> and open souce Python frameworks</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/access-grants/\">Amazon S3 Access Grants</a> maps identities in directories such as Active Directory or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> principals, to datasets in S3. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/07/amazon-s3-access-grants-integrate-sagemaker-studio/\">The integration with Amazon SageMaker Studio</a> for machine learning (ML) helps you map identities to your machine learning (ML) datasets in S3. The integration with the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/boto3-s3-access-grants-plugin\">AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) plugin</a> replaces any custom code required to manage data permissions, so you can use S3 Access Grants in open source Python frameworks such as <a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/\">TensorFlow</a>, <a href=\"https://numpy.org/\">NumPy</a>, <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/\">Pandas</a>, and more.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a> introduces new controls to make it easier to search, filter, and aggregate Lambda function logs</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/07/aws-lambda-search-filter-aggregate-function-logs/\">You can now capture your Lambda logs in JSON structured format</a> without bringing your own logging libraries. You can also control the log level (for example, ERROR, DEBUG, or INFO) of your Lambda logs without making any code changes. Lastly, you can choose the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/\">Amazon CloudWatch</a> log group to which Lambda sends your logs.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon DataZone introduces fine-grained access control</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/07/amazon-datazone-fine-grained-access-control/\">Amazon DataZone has introduced fine-grained access control</a>, providing data owners granular control over their data at row and column levels. You use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/datazone/\">Amazon DataZone</a> to catalog, discover, analyze, share, and govern data at scale across organizational boundaries with governance and access controls. Data owners can now restrict access to specific records of data instead of granting access to an entire dataset.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Direct Connect proposes native 400 Gbps dedicated connections at select locations</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/\">AWS Direct Connect</a> provides private, high-bandwidth connectivity between AWS and your data center, office, or colocation facility. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/07/aws-direct-connect-native-400-gbps-dedicated-connections-select-locations/\">Native 400 Gbps connections provide higher bandwidth</a> without the operational overhead of managing multiple 100 Gbps connections in a link aggregation group. The increased capacity delivered by 400 Gbps connections is particularly beneficial to applications that transfer large-scale datasets, such as for ML and large language model (LLM) training or advanced driver assistance systems for autonomous vehicles.</p> \n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a> \n<p><span><strong>Other AWS news</strong></span><br /> Here are some additional news items that you might find interesting:</p> \n<p><strong>The list of services available at launch in the upcoming AWS Europe Sovereign Cloud Region is available</strong> – we shared the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/announcing-initial-services-available-in-the-aws-european-sovereign-cloud-backed-by-the-full-power-of-aws/\">list of AWS services that will be initially available at launch in the new AWS European Sovereign Cloud Region</a>. The list has no surprises. Services for security, networking, storage, computing, containers, artificial intelligence (AI), and serverless will be available at launch. We are <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-digital-sovereignty-pledge-announcing-a-new-independent-sovereign-cloud-in-europe/\" target=\"_blank\">building the AWS European Sovereign Cloud</a> to offer public sector organizations and customers in highly regulated industries further choice to help them meet their unique digital sovereignty requirements, as well as stringent data residency, operational autonomy, and resiliency requirements. This is an investment of 7.8 billion euros (approximately $8.46 billion). The new Region will be available by the end of 2025.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Upcoming AWS events</strong></span><br /> Check your calendars and sign up for upcoming AWS events:</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Summits</strong> – Join free online and in-person events that bring the cloud computing community together to connect, collaborate, and learn about AWS.
