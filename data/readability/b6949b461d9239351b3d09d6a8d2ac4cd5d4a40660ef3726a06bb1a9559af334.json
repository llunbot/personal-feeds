ASTM certified for downhill mountain biking, the Gambit gets a carbon shell packed with dual-density EPS, a MIPS SL anti-rotation liner and space for their ANGi crash sensor at the rear. Priced at $300 USD, you’d expect it to be packing that level of safety tech. Here’s how we got on with the Specialized Gambit.</p><h2>Review: Specialized Gambit</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26073533/specialized-gambit-review-small-602g.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26073533/specialized-gambit-review-small-602g.jpg\" alt=\"specialized gambit actual weight size small 602g\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26073533/specialized-gambit-review-small-602g.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26073533/specialized-gambit-review-small-602g-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26073533/specialized-gambit-review-small-602g-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26073533/specialized-gambit-review-small-602g-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26073533/specialized-gambit-review-small-602g-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26073533/specialized-gambit-review-small-602g-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>At a claimed 640g in size medium, the Specialized Gambit isn’t anywhere near as lightweight as the current holder of the “World’s Lightest” accolade, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/06/24/dainese-linea-01-is-worlds-lightest-full-face-dh-helmet-at-570g-plus-370g-half-shell-too/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dainese Linea 01</a>, which weighs an incredible 576g (though it is much prettier).

The Gambit could be a good choice for enduro racing where you need the protection of a full face helmet but don’t want your head to boil inside of one as you pedal the transitions.

This means they actually stay well clear of my ears, allowing me hear almost as well as if I were wearing a regular open face helmet.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26102252/specialized-gambit-lightweight-full-face-helmet-review-cheek-pads.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26102252/specialized-gambit-lightweight-full-face-helmet-review-cheek-pads.jpg\" alt=\"specialized gambit dh helmet review cheek pads removable\" width=\"1600\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26102252/specialized-gambit-lightweight-full-face-helmet-review-cheek-pads.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26102252/specialized-gambit-lightweight-full-face-helmet-review-cheek-pads-297x99.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26102252/specialized-gambit-lightweight-full-face-helmet-review-cheek-pads-800x267.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26102252/specialized-gambit-lightweight-full-face-helmet-review-cheek-pads-120x40.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26102252/specialized-gambit-lightweight-full-face-helmet-review-cheek-pads-768x256.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26102252/specialized-gambit-lightweight-full-face-helmet-review-cheek-pads-1536x512.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The cheek pads can be removed for the purposes of washing but they’re really fiddly to pop back in. I found that, after being removed once, I could never quite get them back in very securely. They now pop back out very easily. After a day of shuttling, this became frustrating as one of the cheek pads had a tendency to pop out every time I put the helmet back on.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104027/specialized-gambit-fixed-visor-breakaway.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104027/specialized-gambit-fixed-visor-breakaway.jpg\" alt=\"specialized gambit fixed visor breakaway\" width=\"1600\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104027/specialized-gambit-fixed-visor-breakaway.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104027/specialized-gambit-fixed-visor-breakaway-297x99.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104027/specialized-gambit-fixed-visor-breakaway-800x267.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104027/specialized-gambit-fixed-visor-breakaway-120x40.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104027/specialized-gambit-fixed-visor-breakaway-768x256.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104027/specialized-gambit-fixed-visor-breakaway-1536x512.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>I did (accidentally) drop the Gambit from a height of around 2 feet onto the lino flooring of my van. Unfortunately, the visor took the hit and one side came free of its purchase on the main body of the lid. The ease with which the visor breaks away from the main body in the event of a crash is important to ensure it doesn’t contribute to any undesirable rotational forces the head might experience upon impact.</p><div id=\"attachment_276295\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104821/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-276295\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104821/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible.jpg\" alt=\"specialized gambit helmet review smith squad goggle compatible\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104821/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104821/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104821/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104821/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104821/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26104821/specialized-gambit-dh-helmet-review-smith-squad-goggle-compatible-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-276295\">I found my Smith Squad goggles fit very well with the Specialized Gambit full face helmet. Credit: Ellie Lawton.</p></div><p>Overall, I rate the the Specialized Gambit as merely OK. While I applaud Specialized for creating a very lightweight, extremely well ventilated DH-certified full face helmet, I did find the quality in certain areas to be lacking; namely, the cheek pads and comfort liner. It’s certainly not as comfortable as other, heavier, full face helmets I’ve tested. Perhaps I’m being a little harsh, but at $300 USD I’d expect the quality to be a little higher.</p><h3>Availability</h3><p>The Specialized Gambit is available now from Specialized dealers worldwide in sizes S, M and L, retailing at $300 USD.</p><ul><li>Small : 51-56 cm, 602g (actual)<u></u></li><li>Medium : 55-59 cm, 640g (claimed)<u></u></li><li>Large : 58-62 cm, 730g (claimed)</li></ul><p>Check out other colorway options on the Specialized website.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en?gaRegionChange=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Specialized.com</em></a></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b6949b461d9239351b3d09d6a8d2ac4cd5d4a40660ef3726a06bb1a9559af334","category":"Cycling"}
