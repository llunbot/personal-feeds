WeThePeople describe it as a bike inspired by gravity mountain biking, but never forgetting how much fun it can be to ride a bike on 20â€³ wheels. And fully embracing what it feels like to throw a BMX into the air, whipping tricks off some dirt jumpsâ€¦</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WeThePeople Swamp Master full-suspension BMX bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We got a little tease that a prototype Swamp Master existed last winter, when sister brand Ã‰clat launched their disc brake <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/eclat-exile-hub-brings-disc-brakes-fast-cassette-engagement-to-bmx-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Exile</a> cassette BMX hub. And weâ€™d already seen WTP taking a bit of MTB inspiration with their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wtp-chaos-machine-brings-disc-brakes-to-freestyle-bmx-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Chaos Machine</a>. But this now takes it to the next level. And to 100mm of BMX suspension travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so a quick refresher on 20â€³ fullies. Weâ€™ve been watching <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/must-watch-fingers-crossed-bmx-has-us-questioning-sanity-gluing-forks-back-together/\" target=\"_blank\">Fingers Crossed</a> hacking together sketchy full-suspension with BMX legend Ruben Alcantara <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/are-full-suspension-disc-brakes-big-tires-the-future-of-bmx-ruben-alcantara-friends-imagine-what-if/\" target=\"_blank\">since early 2020</a>. But those prototypes always scared us. A year later we saw UK custom BMX frame builder <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/deathpack-bmx-will-convert-your-ride-to-a-full-suspension-bmx-for-400/\" target=\"_blank\">DeathPack</a> offering to convert your current bike for a reasonable price.

Combining a burly 4130 chromoly frame with legit air suspension, and monster 2.6â€³ wide tires to create a tiny bike meant to send huge jumps.

So if you missed out, talk to your WTP dealer now to lock in one of the next run.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WeThePeople-Swamp-Master-4130-steel-full-suspension-BMX-bike_winter-photo-by-Niklas-Sundin.jpg\"><img width=\"1400\" height=\"1700\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WeThePeople-Swamp-Master-4130-steel-full-suspension-BMX-bike_winter-photo-by-Niklas-Sundin.jpg\" alt=\"WeThePeople Swamp Master complete bike, 4130 steel full-suspension BMX bike, photo by Niklas Sundin\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WeThePeople-Swamp-Master-4130-steel-full-suspension-BMX-bike_winter-photo-by-Niklas-Sundin.jpg 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WeThePeople-Swamp-Master-4130-steel-full-suspension-BMX-bike_winter-photo-by-Niklas-Sundin-247x300.jpg 247w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WeThePeople-Swamp-Master-4130-steel-full-suspension-BMX-bike_winter-photo-by-Niklas-Sundin-800x971.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WeThePeople-Swamp-Master-4130-steel-full-suspension-BMX-bike_winter-photo-by-Niklas-Sundin-99x120.jpg 99w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WeThePeople-Swamp-Master-4130-steel-full-suspension-BMX-bike_winter-photo-by-Niklas-Sundin-768x933.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WeThePeople-Swamp-Master-4130-steel-full-suspension-BMX-bike_winter-photo-by-Niklas-Sundin-1265x1536.jpg 1265w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumor has it, a separate frameset, perhaps even a Signature-series Swamp Master, may be available in 2024 for your own custom bull-suspension BMX build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.wethepeoplebmx.de/\" target=\"_blank\">WeThePeopleBMX.de</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wethepeople-swamp-master-full-suspension-bmx-bike/\">WeThePeople Swamp Master Goes Full MTB on Full-Suspension BMX Production Bike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8bff3907488f0ebdd054ba8ca02623a144429cecba02cf5e1b809d0d038e7a5e","category":"Cycling"}
