But before we get into some cracking kit, let’s recap the busy week we’ve had at <em>Cyclist</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re obviously gearing up for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France</a> and with all the talk of a potential Giro/Tour double from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a>, we took a look this week at those who came before him. This includes <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/coppi-tour-de-france-1949\" target=\"_blank\">Fausto Coppi being the first</a> to achieve the feat, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-roche\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Roche’s Triple Crown success in 1987</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/miguel-indurain-giro-tour-double\" target=\"_blank\">Miguel Induráin’s famous double-double</a>. With this year also including a final day time-trial for the first time since 1989, we also revisited Greg LeMond triumphing with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/greg-lemond-closest-tour-de-france-ever\" target=\"_blank\">closest winning margin in Tour history.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re watching the Euros, staff writer Ewan Wilson has decreed what would happen <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-if-euro-2024-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">if the tournament was decided by cycling</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the racing, we also went behind-the-scenes at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/van-rysel\" target=\"_blank\">Van Rysel factory</a>. And there’s been big news with the release of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pinarello-dogma-f-2024\" target=\"_blank\">new Pinarello Dogma F</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/pinarello-dogma-f-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">tech editor Sam Challis put together his thoughts on the bike so far</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest story of the week comes from editor Pete Muir though, with his opinion piece: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-expensive-road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">‘Stop griping about the price of bikes’</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right, let’s get into it.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related

They come in Renegades or Classics³ designs and can feature the white Williams ‘W’ on the side. The first thing I noticed is just how light they are, weighing only 28 grams, and importantly they also have 100% UV protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funnily enough, I’ve been looking for a good pair of black shades that have some support near the nose bridge as my previous pair (admittedly £2 from Primark, so you get what you pay for) kept sliding down when sweaty. The design on the Classics³ keeps them in place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also offer upgrades to lenses including 8KO Polarised with an anti-glare filter. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sungod.co%2Fen-gb%2Fshop%2Flimited-edition%2Fwilliams-f1-classics4%3Frlt%3D1%26sku%3Dclassics4-le_williams\" target=\"_blank\">SunGod (£80) </a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Columbia Sportswear Tech T-Shirt and Hoodie</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/IMG_3538-970x647.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/IMG_3538-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/IMG_3538-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/IMG_3538-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/IMG_3538-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/IMG_3538-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/IMG_3538-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/IMG_3538-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/IMG_3538-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/IMG_3538-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/IMG_3538-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This technical tee from Columbia is designed for summer activities on hot days – like the ones we’ve (finally) been having recently – and is made with a cooling and sweat-wicking design.

Go behind the scenes with the teams and riders at all the major tours and Classics through the lens of world-class pro-cycling photographer, Kristof Ramon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Art of Suffering</em> is about the human story of road racing, what it takes to go deep and be the best, and the awe-inspiring feats of endurance that make road cycling one of the most challenging, most legendary, most inspirational sports in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From battling the elements and the terrain to epic climbs, crashes, injuries and recovery; personal sacrifices, pushing the body to the limit, training, winning, losing and long seasons on the road; featuring the domestiques, the star riders, the new talent and the legends – this book captures all the reasons why cycling fans passionately love their sport, taking them closer to the action and their favourite riders than any other book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carefully curated, thoughtfully designed and beautifully produced – <em>The Art of Suffering</em> is the ultimate gift for cycling fans and features a foreword by Wout van Aert, the subject of Ramon’s cover photograph.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.laurenceking.com/products/the-art-of-suffering?_pos=1&amp;_sid=b58448493&amp;_ss=r\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BUY IT NOW</strong></a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Ad feature ends</strong></em></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into the week: The Euros </h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>The food wars continue at the Euros <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png\" alt=\"😅\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f32d.png\" alt=\"🌭\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/iMPfGI8PMx\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/iMPfGI8PMx</a></p>— Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/footballontnt/status/1803890814243807668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">June 20, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer is here, the sky is blue and it’s coming home. Right? Whatever you think about England’s potential to win it all, you can’t deny there’s been some brilliant action just one week into the Euros. But let’s be real, very little of that action has featured England, who in truth have been pretty boring to watch in comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a big fan of Albania personally. Early goals, late goals, they can do it all. Just don’t talk to me about Scotland versus Germany.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you soon.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pinarello-dogma-f-2024\">Pinarello changes the Dogma F’s recipe to get lighter and a touch faster</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/van-rysel\">Making the dream work: Behind the scenes at Van Rysel</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-climbs\">The climbs that will decide the 2024 Tour de France</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-expensive-road-bikes\">Opinion: Stop griping about the price of bikes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2024: Route, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sungod-williams-sunglasses\">In the Drops: SunGod Williams sunnies, Columbia technical tops, HJ Socks and the Euros</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"226d36ea79eeec2506b0b862ed748faa10184ae661e4ebda53e0788c9d744112","category":"Cycling"}
