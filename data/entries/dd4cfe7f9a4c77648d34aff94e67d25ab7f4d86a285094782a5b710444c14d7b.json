It’s on Google, after all, which claims to vet the ads it carries. Making the ruse all the more convincing, clicking on it leads to ķeepass[.]info, which, when viewed in an address bar, appears to be the <a href=\"https://keepass.info/\">genuine Keepass site</a>.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fake-keepass-website.png\"><img alt=\"Screenshot showing keepass.info in the URL and Keepass logo.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fake-keepass-website-640x393.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fake-keepass-website.png 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fake-keepass-website.png\">Screenshot showing keepass.info in the URL and Keepass logo.</a> (credit: Malwarebytes)</p></div>\n<p>A closer look at the link, however, shows that the site is <em>not</em> the genuine one. In fact, ķeepass[.]info—at least when it appears in the address bar—is just an encoded way of denoting xn--eepass-vbb[.]info, which, it turns out, is pushing a malware family tracked as FakeBat. Combining the ad on Google with a website with an almost identical URL creates a near-perfect storm of deception.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977141#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977141&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dd4cfe7f9a4c77648d34aff94e67d25ab7f4d86a285094782a5b710444c14d7b","category":"Tech"}
