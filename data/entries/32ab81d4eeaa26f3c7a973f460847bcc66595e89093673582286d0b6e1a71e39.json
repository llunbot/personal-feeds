And today they’re all on sale. Amazon is slashing prices on the entire MacBook line, from the entry-level M1 Air all the way up to the flagship 16-inch Pro. Here are the best prices on each model:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LNQCX/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">M1 MacBook Air (256GB)</a>: $800 ($199 off)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s M1 MacBook Air is about two and a half years old, but it’s still a fantastic laptop. You can choose between silver, space gray, or gold, with an excellent keyboard and the classic MacBook Air wedge design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3C5H787?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">M2 MacBook Air (512GB)</a>: $1,349 ($150 off)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M2 MacBook Air has a new chip and a new design, with a slightly larger display (13.6 inches vs 13.3 inches) than the M1 model. While the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3BVWJ6Y?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">256GB model is also on sale</a> for $150 off, we recommend the 512GB model, which gives you more storage and a faster drive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3C76P69/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">M2 13-inch MacBook Pro (512GB)</a>: $1,300 ($199 off)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 13-inch MacBook Pro is the only MacBook model with a new design and an old chip, but it’s not a bad laptop. Plus it’s the only one with a Touch Bar. Like the M2 Air, we recommend this model over the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3C57XLR/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">256GB one for $1,100</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSHDVBXZ/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">14-inch MacBook Pro (M2 Pro, 512GB)</a>: $1,749 ($250 off)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSHF7LLL/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">16-inch MacBook Pro (M2 Pro, 512GB)</a>: $2,249 ($250 off)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The newest MacBook Pro has Apple’s M2 Pro processor and a few other goodies such as Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, but for the most part, you’re getting a refreshed M1. Not that there’s anything wrong with that—the MacBook Pro’s 2021 redesign brought an incredible display, tons of ports, and a massive speed boost.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"32ab81d4eeaa26f3c7a973f460847bcc66595e89093673582286d0b6e1a71e39","category":"Apple"}
