Based on the amount of radiation it's emitting, the researchers estimate that it accounts for roughly half of the mass of the entire galaxy it's in—an astonishingly high fraction compared to modern galaxies.</p>\n<p>The fact that such a large object can exist only half a billion years after the Big Bang places severe limits on how it could possibly have formed, strongly suggesting that supermassive black holes formed without ever having gone through an intermediate step involving a star.</p>\n<h2>Old X-rays</h2>\n<p>The earliest galaxies in the Universe that we know about have been identified using the James Webb Space Telescope, which took advantage of a galaxy cluster in the foreground that magnified more distant ones through gravitational lensing. Using the lens provided by a specific cluster, the Webb identified 11 galaxies that were imaged as they existed less than a billion years after the Big Bang.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981795#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981795&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5e7528b7976fe45e6779fca5837bad9908ae04e03c4757e4c3b7f5c3aaaa14ca","category":"Tech"}
