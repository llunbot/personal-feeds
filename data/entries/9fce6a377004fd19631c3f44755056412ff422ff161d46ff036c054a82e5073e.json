Microsoft is rolling out the Windows 11 2023 Update, also known as Windows 11 23H2, to the general public starting today, the company <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2023/10/31/how-to-get-the-windows-11-2023-update/\">announced in a blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>Microsoft Windows Servicing and Delivery VP John Cable describes the 23H2 update as \"scoped,\" \"cumulative,\" and \"streamlined,\" which are all different ways of saying that it <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/windows-11-23h2-update-is-coming-later-this-year-but-wont-actually-do-anything/\">doesn't do a whole lot in and of itself</a> other than rolling the version number over. Most of the big new features, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/next-major-windows-update-is-available-september-26th-with-new-ai-and-not-ai-features/\">including the Copilot AI assistant</a>, actually began rolling out a month ago to Windows 11 22H2. It's just that you'llÂ <em>know</em> that any PC running 23H2 has those features, whereas older versions of 22H2 may not.</p>\n\n<p>Cable notes a couple of 23H2-specific additions, namely that the Chat app from earlier Windows 11 releases has been replaced by Microsoft Teams (free) (that was not our parenthetical; that's what the company calls it), which is pinned to the taskbar by default just like Chat used to be. Built-in system apps get a new \"system\" label in the \"All apps\" view on the Start menu, and system apps are now managed separately from other apps in the Settings app under System &gt; System Components.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980157#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1980157&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9fce6a377004fd19631c3f44755056412ff422ff161d46ff036c054a82e5073e","category":"Tech"}
