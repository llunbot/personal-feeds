Brennan</a>, font <a href=\"https://mfek.org\">designer</a> and (now regretful) founder of 8chan,Â <a href=\"https://ftp.mfek.org/Reiser/Letters/\">wrote</a> to the filesystem's creator, Hans Reiser, asking if he wanted to reply to the discussion on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML).</p>\n<p>Reiser, 59, serving <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/09/reiserfs-goes-to-chroot-jail-hans-gets-15-to-life-sentence/\">a potential life sentence</a> in a California prison for the 2006 murder of his estranged wife, Nina Reiser, wrote back with more than 6,500 words, which Brennan then <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/b98b29cf-27d9-49e0-b10b-1848399badfd@kittens.ph/T/#u\">forwarded to the LKML</a>. It's not often you see somebody apologize for killing their wife, explain their coding decisions around balanced trees versus extensible hashing, and suggest that elementary schools offer the same kinds of emotional intelligence curriculum that they've worked through in prison, in a software mailing list. It's quite a document.</p>\n<p>What follows is a relative summary of Reiser's letter, dated November 26, 2023, which we <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Hans-Reiser-2024\">first saw on the Phoronix blog</a>, and which, by all appearances, is authentic (or would otherwise be an epic bit of minutely detailed fraud for no particular reason). It covers, broadly, why Reiser believes his system failed to gain mindshare among Linux users, beyond the most obvious reason. This leads Reiser to detail the technical possibilities, his interpersonal and leadership failings and development, some lingering regrets about dealings with SUSE and Oracle and the Linux community at large, and other topics, including modern Russian geopolitics.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997385#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997385&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8ac830000a708b4935e6365ee7f60d4f80c3148891c8fbf6c0d07daebae23c31","category":"Tech"}
