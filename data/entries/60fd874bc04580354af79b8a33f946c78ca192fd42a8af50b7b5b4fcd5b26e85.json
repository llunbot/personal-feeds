This means the device will likely support Face ID, whereas the current iPhone SE has a Touch ID button. As mentioned, he also expects the device to support Apple Intelligence, which is currently available on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and any of the new iPhone 16 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iPad Air models will apparently have \"internal improvements,\" but Gurman did not provide any specific details. He also expects an updated version of the Magic Keyboard for both the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Air, with some of the new features previously introduced on the latest iPad Pro version of the keyboard.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ipad-air-gradient.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nMarch and April are common months for Apple to announce new iPhone SE and iPad Air models, with a virtual event or press releases both possibilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple last updated the iPhone SE in March 2022, while the iPad Air lineup was last updated in May this year with the M2 chip and a first-ever 13-inch model.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/new-iphone-se-and-ipad-air-early-2025-rumor/\">iPhone SE With Apple Intelligence, New iPad Air, and More Reportedly Launching 'Early Next Year'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-with-apple-intelligence-new-ipad-air-and-more-reportedly-launching-early-next-year.2438836/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"60fd874bc04580354af79b8a33f946c78ca192fd42a8af50b7b5b4fcd5b26e85","category":"Apple"}
