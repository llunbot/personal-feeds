This year marks the return of Bruges as the men’s race start town, with the race having started from Antwerp since 2016.</p>\n<p>A bigger change in 2017 was the reintroduction of the famous <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/is-the-muur-van-geraardsbergen-flanders-greatest-climb\" target=\"_blank\">Muur van Geraardsbergen</a>, although its distance from the finish meant it wasn’t the decisive berg and was promptly removed again and the climb is saved for Omloop Het Nieuwsblad.</p>\n<p>The women’s peloton scale the cobbled bergs of Flanders on the same day, although on a shorter course – 158km versus the men’s 273.4km – from and back to Oudenaarde. Like the men’s race, it’s still the one-two punch of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/oude-kwaremont-climb\" target=\"_blank\">Oude Kwaremont</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paterberg-tour-of-flanders-classic-climb\" target=\"_blank\">Paterberg</a> that will shape the finale of the race.</p>\n<h2>Tour of Flanders 2023: Key

Flanders has changed the route numerous times over the course of its 100+ editions. This year’s parcours is very slightly longer than 2022 at a whopping 273.4km.</p>\n<p>From its start in Bruges the race heads towards the town of Oudenaarde, with neither cobbles nor climbs kicking in until after more than 100km of racing.</p>\n<p>The first cobbled sector is Huisepontweg at 109km and the first climb comes just over 5km later at Korte Ast. Oude Kwaremont is the first big name another 20km down the road at 136.8km into the race, and it is there that the action really begins.</p>\n<p>With its 103m ascent gain, averaging 4.8% gradient and topping out at 10%, the Kwaremont will be tackled three times taking in both sides of the climb with the final with just under 20km to go.</p>\n<p>A total of 19 cobbled <em>hellingen </em>(climbs) including the famous Wolvenberg, Valkenberg, Koppenberg, Taaienberg and Kruisberg soften the legs and split the race to pieces before we head into the finale. </p>\n<p>Shorter than Oude Kwaremont but viciously steep with gradients of up to 20%, the Paterberg is tackled first at 51km and is the race’s final climb at 13km to go, with a flat run-in to that iconic finishing straight after its cresting. </p>\n<h2>Women’s Tour of Flanders 2023 route</h2>\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"685\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/parcours-rvv23-women-elite-685x970.png\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/parcours-rvv23-women-elite-685x970.png 685w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/parcours-rvv23-women-elite-212x300.png 212w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/parcours-rvv23-women-elite-768x1087.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/parcours-rvv23-women-elite-1085x1536.png 1085w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/parcours-rvv23-women-elite-1447x2048.png 1447w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/parcours-rvv23-women-elite-750x1061.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/parcours-rvv23-women-elite-1140x1613.png 1140w\" /><figcaption>Flanders Classics</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n<p>The women’s route is similar to the men’s, albeit over 100km shorter and both starting and finishing in Oudenaarde, with the same Kwaremont/Paterberg one-two punch headlining the action.</p>\n<p>The women’s peloton will tackle 13 bergs and it’s all-go from the start given they head right into the thick of the Flemish Ardennes, starting with the Tiegemberg at just 10km in and taking in the classics including Wolvenberg, Valkenberg.

Most classic races were started to create headlines for a newspaper, and the Tour of Flanders is no different.</p>\n<p>The race was first conceived by Léon van den Haute, who wrote for <em>Sportwereld</em>, as a celebration of the Flemish region as the other major Belgian race, Liege-Bastogne-Liege, was held in the French-speaking region of Belgium.</p>\n<p>The first edition of De Ronde left Ghent at 6 am on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 1913 and wound its way to a wooden velodrome in Mariakerke through 330km of badly kept roads. The first winner was Paul Deman, aged 25, outsprinting a group of six after over 12 hours of racing.</p>\n<p>Although the first few editions were successful, the race still struggled to attract a lot of entries, and financial sponsorship with it. The race really gained popularity in the 1930s, perhaps as a result of shortening the race to 264km, and by 1933 there was 164 riders on the start line.</p>\n<p>The first 40 years of the Tour of Flanders is also famous for not allowing the riders any mechanical assistance. In the ‘30s the rules were changed so that a rider could accept a pump, or spare tyre, but only in an emergency and entirely at the commissaire’s discretion. Bike changes were only permitted if the frame, wheel or bars broke while riding.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the 1950s, the rules were changed to bring the Ronde more in line with other professional races.</p>\n<p>The 1960s was the decade that cemented Flanders in cycling history. Tom Simpson became the first British winner in 1961, followed by a huge popularity surge in 1962 that saw the finish moved to Gentbrugge to cope with the spectators. 1969 marked the emergence of Eddy Merckx, who won the race by 5’ 36” over Felice Gimondi – the race’s largest ever winning margin.</p>\n<h3>Era of the ‘Bergs’ </h3>\n<div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124523/koppenberg_crash-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124523/koppenberg_crash-970x647.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124523/koppenberg_crash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124523/koppenberg_crash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124523/koppenberg_crash-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124523/koppenberg_crash-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124523/koppenberg_crash.jpg 1200w\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"647\" /></div>\n<p>Flanders made more big changes in the 1970s – the race was known for its tough course but many of the original roads had been paved over, making the course considerably easier.</p>\n<p>In 1973 the finish was moved again, this time to Meerbeke, close to the Muur van Geraardsbergen, which became a legendary part of the race. In 1976 the Koppenberg was included, feared by many due to its 22% cobbled ramps, and was the location of the beginning of Roger De Vlaeminck and Freddy Maertens’ bitter rivalry.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124526/johan_museeuw_flanders_1998-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124526/johan_museeuw_flanders_1998-970x647.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124526/johan_museeuw_flanders_1998-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124526/johan_museeuw_flanders_1998-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124526/johan_museeuw_flanders_1998-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124526/johan_museeuw_flanders_1998-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124526/johan_museeuw_flanders_1998.jpg 1200w\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"647\" /></div>\n<p>The 1980s were characterised by complete domination by Belgian and Dutch riders, including the legendary 1985 edition that saw only 24 out of 174 finish.</p>\n<p>The 1990s era of Flanders is best known for Johan Museeuw’s exploits that included three victories and eight podium finishes.

In the 2000s a new star of Belgian cycling emerged, Tom Boonen, who won two consecutive victories in 2005 and 2006, with another following in 2012.</p>\n<p>The big upset came in 2011, not from the riders but from the organising committee. The race was taken over by ‘Flanders Classics’, who moved the finish to Oudenaarde, much closer to the Koppenberg but also removing the Muur from the parcours to a great outcry from the fans. The Tour of Flanders celebrated its 100<sup>th</sup> edition on 3rd April 2016.</p>\n<h3>Tour of Flanders: Top five editions</h3>\n<h4>1977 – De Vlaeminck vs. Maertens </h4>\n<div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124532/ofs_maertens-vlaemink_1977_-970x682.jpg\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"682\" /></div>\n<p>Roger De Vlaeminck and Freddy Maertens were the stars of Belgian cycling towards the end of the ‘70s and were bitter rivals. They had both been dropped in the 1976 edition as they both decided they would rather lose than see the other one win.</p>\n<p>In 1977, Maertens suffered a puncture on the newly introduced Koppenberg while De Vlaeminck broke away. Maertens was given a wheel by a spectator and assisted to the top where he quickly caught De Vlaeminck, who had also punctured. As it was just the two riders together, De Vlaeminck refused to work with Maertens.</p>\n<p>Maertens rode 70km to the finish, with De Vlaeminck stuck to his wheel, and was then easily beaten by a relatively fresh De Vlaeminck in the sprint. It was De Vlaeminck’s only Flanders win.</p>\n<p>The riders both fell out and to this day still dispute that day’s events. Maertens claims he believed he was to be disqualified for the wheel swap, and De Vlaeminck supposedly offered to pay him to keep riding and evade the peloton.</p>\n<p>De Vlaeminck denies this and claims he was riding tactically as he knew Maertens was a better sprinter.</p>\n<h4>1985 – Vanderaerden vs. the elements</h4>\n<div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124539/ofs_eric_vanderaerden_198-3-970x635.jpg\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"635\" /></div>\n<p>Although Eric Vanderaerden’s solo win, aged 23, is worthy of a mention itself, it’s the weather that really grabbed the headlines. Vanderaerden broke a wheel before the Koppenberg but managed to chase back onto a strong leading group including Greg LeMond and his team-mate Phil Anderson.</p>\n<p>Although a sprinter, Vanderaerden attacked on the Muur and soloed the final 20km to the finish. While the attack is impressive enough, it all took place during a severe storm that broke during the second leg of the race. Of 174 starters, only 24 finished.</p>\n<h4>1987 – Jesper Skibby vs. the race official </h4>\n<div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124546/ofs_jesper-skibby_1987_01-970x635.jpg\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"635\" /></div>\n<p>The Koppenberg’s fame comes not only from the steepness of its cobbled slopes but also the narrowness of the road. This all came to a head in 1987, when Danish rider Jesper Skibby was hit by an official car.</p>\n<p>The car was following close behind and when Skibby began to slow, the car (pressured by the encroaching peloton) knocked Skibby to the ground while trying to pass then ran over his back wheel, narrowly missing his leg and ending his race.

I waste no time in hitting the first stretch of the infamous Flemish cobbles.</p>\n<p>\n</p><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124557/gwp-flanderssportive-067-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124557/gwp-flanderssportive-067-970x645.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124557/gwp-flanderssportive-067-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124557/gwp-flanderssportive-067-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124557/gwp-flanderssportive-067-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124557/gwp-flanderssportive-067-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124557/gwp-flanderssportive-067.jpg 1200w\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"645\" /></div>\n<h3>The path to Oudenaarde</h3>\n<p>The cobble is a curious little artefact. Protruding about one or two centimetres from the ground at random jagged angles, with a slippery and inconsistent surface texture, it would appear to have been designed deliberately to provide the worst possible surface for riding a bike on.</p>\n<p>Rolling along Bruges’s cobbled city streets, I repeat to myself the advice I’ve been given time and time again: ‘Loose hands, big gear, light steering.’</p>\n<p>It’s all going remarkably well, but I begin to suspect these neatly laid stones pale in comparison with what lies ahead. Crossing a drawbridge out of the centre, hundreds of <span>cyclists feed onto the main road and head on the 100km journey to where the cobbles proper begin.</span></p>\n<p>Interestingly, none of the routes available on this sportive replicates the precise route of the pro race of the following day. The race organisers decided in 2011 to loop over the Oude Kwaremont climb three times, offering a hub for spectators, but removing some of the classic climbs from the race’s history.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the sportive follows a hybrid route between the old and new course. It covers 15 climbs (‘bergs’ as they’re called), and a handful of cobbled flat sections. But first comes the trek to Oudenaarde.</p>\n<p>On seeing the route plan, I imagined we would hurtle through the first 100km on wide roads in a pack hundreds deep. But unfortunately, the organisers are quick to force us onto the cycle paths that border the roads. Little known to me is the fact that the use of cycle lanes is compulsory where they’re available in Belgium.</p>\n<p>While the cycle paths are impressively maintained and wide, we quickly find ourselves in a thick bunch squeezing through bollards and hoping that no unseen obstacles pop up out of the mass of riders.</p>\n<p>I get into a conversation with a pair of friendly Londoners, Ryan and Dan, who warn that the next 90km is much the same, but promise that the cobbles will be worth the wait.</p>\n<p>\n</p><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124559/gwp-flanderssportive-757-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124559/gwp-flanderssportive-757-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124559/gwp-flanderssportive-757-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124559/gwp-flanderssportive-757-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124559/gwp-flanderssportive-757-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124559/gwp-flanderssportive-757-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124559/gwp-flanderssportive-757.jpg 1200w\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"646\" /></div>\n<p>Up ahead a handful of riders are powering away from the group. I seize the opportunity for a little more space and sprint my way up to them. I glance behind and see a solitary figure chasing us down. ‘That’s one match burnt,’ he exclaims in a strong Irish accent.</p>\n<p>In our smaller group we manage to cover the first 100km in a little under three hours. Herbie, the match-burning Irishman, has pushed hard on the front at an alarming pace that means that by Oudenaarde I’m slightly worried that my own matchbox may soon be empty.</p>\n<h3>The tip of the Berg</h3>\n<p>As seemingly flat as the region of Flanders may be, it’s also home to innumerable short climbs with painfully steep gradients. It’s what makes the Tour of Flanders the domain of only the toughest riders.</p>\n<p>What’s more, the insistence by the Flemish government to protect the cobbled road surfaces as sites of national heritage gives rise to a unique feature – the cobbled climb.</p>\n<p>The first climb of the day is already strewn with broken spirits. The Wolvenberg, reaching only 60m of elevation at an average of 4%, looks easy on the route profile but it includes a nasty 200m stretch of 20%, and as we grind up the slope I’m painfully aware of the 130km left ahead of me. </p>\n<p>\n</p><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124602/gwp-flanderssportive-826-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124602/gwp-flanderssportive-826-970x645.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124602/gwp-flanderssportive-826-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124602/gwp-flanderssportive-826-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124602/gwp-flanderssportive-826-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124602/gwp-flanderssportive-826-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124602/gwp-flanderssportive-826.jpg 1200w\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"645\" /></div>\n<p>Having crested the Wolvenberg we hit two flat cobbled sections in quick succession that make me realise just how mild the Bruges stretch was. My hands are tightening up, I’m pushing all my effort into a big gear and maintaining a reasonable speed, but it comes at a great cost to the energy reserves in my legs. </p>\n<p>After our flirtation with cobbles, the road returns to glorious tarmac for a while, cutting through sunny farmlands, until I spy a cobbled path emerging from the hedgerow to our left. Looking ahead at the Molenberg snaking up into the hillside, I get my first real taste of the savagery of the Ronde.</p>\n<p>The Molenberg is extremely difficult to climb. The cobbles give little traction and the road tilts up to a punishing 15%. More than a muscular or cardiovascular demand, the real challenge is maintaining balance. Remembering the friendly advice of fellow cyclists, I try to keep the gear high and my hands loose, but it’s easier said than done. I’m struggling to keep a decent cadence and I’m gripping my bars for dear life.</p>\n<p>\n</p><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124605/gwp-flanderssportive-584-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124605/gwp-flanderssportive-584-970x645.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124605/gwp-flanderssportive-584-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124605/gwp-flanderssportive-584-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124605/gwp-flanderssportive-584-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124605/gwp-flanderssportive-584-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124605/gwp-flanderssportive-584.jpg 1200w\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"645\" /></div>\n<p>What’s more, by the time we hit the cobbled climbs, we’re arriving alongside the stragglers from the shorter routes, and I have to dart and squeeze through gaps while keeping up some reasonable pace on the climb.</p>\n<p>The Molenberg is followed by an easy 20km on tarmac punctuated by cobbled and concreted sections. But it’s not long before the climbs are back, with the paved Valkenberg and Boigneberg striking in quick succession, and the cobbled Eikenberg following.</p>\n<p>The gutter offers some relief from the cobbles, although I feel a little guilty for rolling along its flat surface. Herbie, who I’ve stuck with so far, looks away in disgust, opting instead for the middle of the <i>pavé</i>. ‘You can avoid cobbles at home, mate!’ he shouts.</p>\n<p>Then, only a food stop separates us from the hardest climb of the day – the Koppenberg.</p>\n<h3>King of the cobbles</h3>\n<p>In the run-up to the Koppenberg, it seems that only me and a Flemish man, who must be in his late seventies, seem to be keen on doing any of the work at the front of our little chain gang, and by the time we reach the foot of the climb, it’s clear enough why – the road is crowded with walking cyclists.</p>\n<p>On the lower slopes, the cobbles immediately drain what little reserves I have left, and I switch straight into my easiest gear – fortunately a considerate 34/32.</p>\n<p>As the Koppenberg starts to bite, I’m juggling the quad-tearingly steep gradient with my route through the crowds and my traction on the cobbles. It was here in 1987 that Danish pro Jesper Skibby famously hit the ground while on a solo break, and was subsequently run over by the race director eager not to hold up the chasing pack. I’m hopeful not to reenact the scene.</p>\n<p>\n</p><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124608/gwp-flanderssportive-484-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124608/gwp-flanderssportive-484-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124608/gwp-flanderssportive-484-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124608/gwp-flanderssportive-484-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124608/gwp-flanderssportive-484-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124608/gwp-flanderssportive-484-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124608/gwp-flanderssportive-484.jpg 1200w\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"646\" /></div>\n<p>I manage to stay upright, and just as I feel like I’m about to pop, I suddenly seem to be airborne and floating above the road. The cobbles have given way to tarmac and the relief is exquisite.</p>\n<p>Before I have my breath back we hit the Steenbeekdries, which again mixes incline and cobbles. It’s also the only stretch of the course to offer a cobbled descent, which is a prospect that has my already aching joints twanging with trepidation. Strangely, at speed the cobbles seem barely perceptible, and I touch 45kmh on the descent (a glance at Strava afterwards shows that Nikki Terpstra hit 65kmh on this same stretch). </p>\n<p>Next comes the Taaienberg, followed quickly by the Kanarieberg, the Kruisberg and the Karnemelkbeekstraat. Keeping track of the climbs is almost as exhausting as riding up them, but I know we’re winding towards the finish now, with a couple of obstacles in our way – the queen climbs of the day.</p>\n<p>The Oude Kwaremont and the Paterberg are both cobbled, with the Kwaremont being the longest climb of the day, and the Paterberg the steepest. </p>\n<p>The Kwaremont may be long, but it’s considerate in its incline and begins with a winding 5% tarmac section (it will be here that Fabian Cancellara will make his break in following day’s pro race to win the 2014 Tour of Flanders).</p>\n<p>When the cobbles hit, there’s no hiding as there’s not even an inch of gutter, but I’m finding my rhythm and with the sun out, and the land opening up to pleasant vistas, I’m beginning to enjoy the rattle of the cobbles.</p>\n<p>The <i>pavé</i> spikes up to an aggressive 12%, but then levels off and moves to a shallower 3% stretch. I spot some flat paving in the gutter and steal a moment of relief, until Herbie’s look of disappointment pulls me back onto the cobbles. Looking over the rolling Belgian fields, I can see why, despite its desolate flatness, Flanders holds a magnetic charm over cyclists.</p>\n<p>The Paterberg is the centrepiece of the pro race, featuring three times. The climb has an interesting history, in that it’s one of the least historical climbs of the race.</p>\n<p>It was featured for the first time in 1986, only after local farmer, Paul Vande Walle wrote to the organisers insisting his own self-paved farm track outdid any of those currently included in the race. They repaved it to ‘regulation’ cobbles and it’s been<br />a central feature ever since.</p>\n<p>\n</p><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124611/gwp-flanderssportive-284-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124611/gwp-flanderssportive-284-970x645.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124611/gwp-flanderssportive-284-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124611/gwp-flanderssportive-284-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124611/gwp-flanderssportive-284-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124611/gwp-flanderssportive-284-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/02124611/gwp-flanderssportive-284.jpg 1200w\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"645\" /></div>\n<p>Squeezing my way up, I curse Vande Walle with all my limited breath. Taking the first corner of the Paterberg, the full 400m cobbled stretch lies in view, and the summit seems desperately far away.</p>\n<p>I’m sitting in my trusty 34/32 and trying to keep my cadence in double figures, but I do feel I’m finally learning how to handle this abominable road surface – balancing my weight evenly on the bike, I leave my hands loose and let the bike find its own way. Finally I reach the cheering crowds at the summit of the berg, and it’s all downhill from here.</p>\n<p>What starts off as an amble, with everyone catching their breath after the Paterberg, slowly gains speed towards the finish and grows into a full-on train. With Herbie and two Flandrians taking turns on the front, I glance down to see 50kmh pop up on my Garmin on flat roads.</p>\n<p>As the line approaches, our growing pack readies for the final sprint, even though the fastest finishers came in long ago. I fly under the banner and raise a weary arm aloft, before slamming on the brakes to avoid the hordes of riders taking selfies around the finish line.</p>\n<p>As I settle down in a cafe, my bones simply don’t feel right. I’m dehydrated to the point of mummification and I fear it could be days before feeling returns to my perineum.</p>\n<p>Despite the satisfaction of covering 245km in a day, I slightly resent the first 100km – it only served to dilute the charm of the cobbles, and hampered my opportunity to attack them as hard as I would have hoped. Next time, maybe I’ll choose the mid-distance event, but one thing is for certain, I know the cobbles will draw me back again.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-route-riders-sportive-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Flanders 2023: All you need to know including route, how to watch, start list, history and sportive</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"jgibbons","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"9e0d6530ffcc89c2c8a75fca45ccb65cd2ef4661dec9b3c508210f063b9b9ace","category":"Cycling"}
