Apple says the Ceramic Shield on the iPhone 15 is \"tougher than any smartphone glass.\" Introduced on iPhone 12 models in 2020, Apple advertised the ceramic-infused glass as increasing drop performance by 4x compared to the iPhone 11.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore recently, Samsung debuted its newest Galaxy S24 Ultra, which features a Gorilla Glass Armor display panel, also developed by Corning. <a href=\"https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/corning-gorilla-armor.html\">According to Corning</a>, the Armor panel cuts reflections by 75 percent compared to a typical glass surface, and is resistant to micro scratches that build up over time on competing glass panels. Corning also claims the panels offer over 4x more scratch resistance than competitive aluminosilicate cover glasses.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt Gorilla Glass Armor for the iPhone 17, but the description matches the Chinese leaker's claims. Corning could also be supplying Apple with an equivalent technology that will be branded under another name. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/iphone-17-five-rumored-features-2025/\">Six Reasons to Wait for Next Year's iPhone 17</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nCorning has been a longtime Apple supplier, with Gorilla Glass used in devices across Apple's product lineup.
