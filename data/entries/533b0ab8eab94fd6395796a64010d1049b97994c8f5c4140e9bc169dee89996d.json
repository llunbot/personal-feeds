Say hello to the <a href=\"https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/brighter-future-for-hybrid-with-premium-tablets-with-5g-and-next-gen-add-ons/\">Lenovo Tab P12 Pro</a>, a $609.99 high-end Android tablet with an optional pen, kickstand case, and clip-on keyboard.</p>\n<p>In the low-competition world of Android tablets, the P12 Pro looks pretty good. A 12.6-inch, 2500x1600 (16:10) OLED display dominates the front of the device, while the frame and back are aluminum. It's rare to see the Snapdragon 870 SoC that powers the device, but the chip represents a small clock increase to the Snapdragon 865 from 2020 flagship smartphones. It's a 7 nm chip with four Cortex A77 cores and four Cortex A55 cores. The starter model comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and an upgraded SKU comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p>\n<p>There's a 10,200 mAh battery, a fingerprint reader integrated into the side power button, a USB-C port with 45 W Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 compatibility, Wi-Fi up to version 6 (802.11ax) with a 2x2 MIMO antenna, and a microSD slot. There are four speakers, but you'll need to use the included USB-C-to-3.5 mm adapter if you want to use normal headphones. For cameras, you get a front 8 MP sensor and a ToF sensor (presumably for face unlock), plus two rear cameras, a 13 MP main camera and a 5 MP wide-angle. The device ships with Android 11.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792746#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792746&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"533b0ab8eab94fd6395796a64010d1049b97994c8f5c4140e9bc169dee89996d","category":"Tech"}
