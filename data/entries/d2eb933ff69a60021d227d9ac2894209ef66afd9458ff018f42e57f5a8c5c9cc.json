We're proud to support their success.\"</blockquote>\r<br />\nDeveloper billings and sales of digital goods and services hit $131 billion, primarily from games and photo and video editing apps like those from Adobe. Sales of physical goods and services facilitated by ‌App Store‌ apps exceeded $1 trillion.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOver the last five years, spending in digital goods and services, physical goods and services, and in-app advertising has more than doubled, with the strongest growth in physical goods as people are increasingly using apps to order food and groceries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌App Store‌ draws more than 813 million average weekly visitors globally, with Apple's commerce system supporting developers with more than 40 local currencies and tax handling in 200 regions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs with Apple's U.S. study, the global study highlights the ‌App Store‌ benefits and tools available to developers, including the more than 100 technical sessions that will come out next week during the 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe study's release comes as Apple is facing regulatory and legal pressure over its ‌App Store‌ rules in multiple countries. In addition to being forced to allow developers to direct customers to web-based purchase options in the U.S., Apple is also continuing to struggle with the Digital Markets Act in Europe. Apple is currently fighting <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-appeals-eu-dma-interoperability-rules/\">DMA interoperability requirements</a> that require it to give third-party developers access to iOS features that are normally limited to Apple's own products, and it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/23/apple-breach-digital-markets-act-eu/\">has faced fines</a> for compliance issues. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe full study is available through <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/\">Apple's Newsroom article</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/05/app-store-global-ecosystem-study-2024/\">Apple Study: App Store Ecosystem Generated $1.3 Trillion Globally in 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-study-app-store-ecosystem-generated-1-3-trillion-globally-in-2024.2458229/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d2eb933ff69a60021d227d9ac2894209ef66afd9458ff018f42e57f5a8c5c9cc","category":"Apple"}
