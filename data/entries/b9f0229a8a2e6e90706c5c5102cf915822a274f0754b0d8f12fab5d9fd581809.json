Apple did add a \"beta\" label next to hidden Universal Control settings in System Preferences, suggesting that the feature will be considered a public beta when it launches, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/icloud-private-relay-ios-15-public-beta/\">just like iCloud Private Relay on iOS 15</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUniversal Control will allow for a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard to be used across multiple Macs and/or iPads side by side.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther new macOS Monterey features include AirPlay to Mac, a redesigned Safari browser, a Shortcuts app, spatial audio in FaceTime, and more. There is also a new SharePlay feature that will let Apple users watch TV, listen to music, and share their screens with one another, but like Universal Control, this feature is coming later this fall.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/universal-control-macos-monterey-later-this-fall/\">Apple Says Universal Control Coming to macOS Monterey Later This Fall</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-universal-control-coming-to-macos-monterey-later-this-fall.2317605/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MleRTFDAIBI:wxFLH1p0pAE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MleRTFDAIBI:wxFLH1p0pAE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/MleRTFDAIBI\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b9f0229a8a2e6e90706c5c5102cf915822a274f0754b0d8f12fab5d9fd581809","category":"Apple"}
