Those tucked inside the hull of one of these boats. Each linked together. And their power then drives hydraulic systems that can manipulate sails or operate the hydrofoils on outriggers. Something many cyclists might not realize is that this top-tier of sailboat racing has often tapped a number of elite Olympic-level track cyclists to become sailors when the rules allowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically in America’s Cup racing, sailors on the boats called grinders needed to operate hand cranks to quickly reel in and let out the sails during the fast-paced racing.
