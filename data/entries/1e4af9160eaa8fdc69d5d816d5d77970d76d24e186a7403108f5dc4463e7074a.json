It serves as a visually interesting background that's not too distracting for those who want to watch WWDC content with the world shut out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Environment is similar to those that Apple has created for general use, such as Yosemite, Mount Hood, and the Moon. It can be accessed when using the Apple Developer app, and immersion can be adjusted with the Digital Crown.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nWWDC is set to begin next Monday, with a keynote event that will take place at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The keynote can be watched in the Apple Developer app, on YouTube, in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> app, or on Apple's website.
