[credit:\n                              Asus                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>Asus' latest flagship is the <a href=\"https://www.asus.com/mobile-handhelds/phones/zenfone/zenfone-11-ultra/\">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a>. For lovers of small phones, this represents one of the stalwart small-phone manufacturers abandoning you. I'm sorry. The Zenfone 10 was a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-asus-zenfone-10-is-a-tiny-5-9-inch-phone-with-flagship-specs/\">unique little 5.9-inch powerhouse</a>, but the Zenfone 11 is just another big Android phone with the same 6.78-inch display as everyone else. Big displays are expensive, so of course, the price is bigger, too: $899 instead of the $699 price of the smaller phone.</p>\n<p>The whole phone looks a lot more generic than last year. Instead of the two big camera circles of the Zenfone 10, the back now has a square camera block that looks like every other phone. The front screen is flat, the sides are a flat metal band, and the only real identifying features are a few decorative lines on the rear panel.</p>\n<p>That big 6.78-inch display is a 2400Ã—1080 OLED. Normally, it runs at 120 Hz, but Asus says it's capable of 144 Hz \"for gaming only.\" It has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, 12GB or 16GB of RAM, and 256GB or 512GB of UFS4.0 storage. The 5500 mAh battery is a bit bigger than most phones, so that's something to cling to. The phone has 65 W wired charging and 15 W wireless charging, IP68 dust and water-resistance, and an in-screen fingerprint reader. There's a 3.5 mm headphone jack on the bottom of the phone.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010158#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010158&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"04dd7d05ba9554854cab8706eea5a7a875e93dc2c765f13a9c78afbd3f0d0b13","category":"Tech"}
