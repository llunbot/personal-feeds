Soon enough, you're running out of spots in your free RealVNC account for your tiny boards and \"real\" computers. Even if you go the hardened route of SSH or an X connection, you have to keep track of where they all are. All of this is not the easiest thing to tackle if you're new to single-board computers or just eager to get started.</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect/\">Raspberry Pi Connect</a>, a new built-in way to access a Rasbperry Pi from nearly anywhere you can open a browser, whether to control yourself or provide remote assistance. On a Raspberry Pi 4, 5, or Pi 400 kit, you install Pi connect with <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/connect.html\">a single terminal line</a>, reboot the Pi, and then click a new tray icon to connect the Pi to <a href=\"https://id.raspberrypi.com/sign-up\">a Raspberry Pi ID</a> (and then enable two-factor authentication, of course).</p>\n<p>From then on, visiting <a href=\"http://connect.raspberrypi.com\">connect.raspberrypi.com</a> gives you an encrypted connection to your desktop. It's a direct connection if possible, and if not, it runs through relay servers in London, encrypting it with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram_Transport_Layer_Security\">DTLS</a> and keeping only the metadata needed for the service to work. The Pi will show a notification in its tray that somebody has connected, and you can manage screen sharing from there. The Pi's docs site has <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/services/connect.html\">a lot more on the particulars</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022695#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022695&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f25f0727fa9ad6f58cc130d289d0a48fff2368904377e6063ef049077fff8948","category":"Tech"}
