Featuring a broad, bold rim profile and Industry Nine hubs, they were an interesting entry to the market for sure (and one that we’ve been testing and liking since…full review coming soon).</p><p>And at $1,699, they weren’t very expensive either. But now there’s an even more affordable version in the $1,299 V7 CF wheelset (and we have a huge Bikerumor-exclusive discount for you at bottom of this post)…</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24161226/nex-gen-V7-CF-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24161226/nex-gen-V7-CF-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-4.jpg\" alt=\"nex-gen v7 cf carbon fiber gravel bike wheels with wide aero rims\" width=\"1246\" height=\"934\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24161226/nex-gen-V7-CF-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-4.jpg 1246w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24161226/nex-gen-V7-CF-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-4-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24161226/nex-gen-V7-CF-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-4-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24161226/nex-gen-V7-CF-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-4-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24161226/nex-gen-V7-CF-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-4-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1246px) 100vw, 1246px\"></a></p><p>The key difference is the move to a standard carbon fiber rim, without the TeXtreme Innegra spread-tow fibers. They also switch to a house-brand hub, more on that in a minute.</p><p>The rims keep the same 33mm wide (26mm internal) and 38.5mm deep rims, with an aerodynamic profile designed by Paul Lew. The layup uses a low FAW Toray carbon fiber that’s tape wound rather than laid up by hand. They say that does two things: The low FAW number means less resin per gram of fiber, complemented by using special “resin scavenging” channels in the molds to get more excess resin out to save weight.</p><p>The tape winding process uses automated machines to wind the carbon plies around a removable mandrel to create the main rim body. This lets them use less overall material, and lay it up under tension, which they say yields a lighter, stronger rim than those laid up by hand with cut pieces of fiber.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24161223/nex-gen-V7-CF-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24161223/nex-gen-V7-CF-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-3.jpg\" alt=\"nex-gen v7 cf carbon fiber gravel bike wheels with wide aero rims\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24161223/nex-gen-V7-CF-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-3.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24161223/nex-gen-V7-CF-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-3-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24161223/nex-gen-V7-CF-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-3-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24161223/nex-gen-V7-CF-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-3-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/24161223/nex-gen-V7-CF-carbon-fiber-gravel-bike-wheels-3-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>Despite losing the highly impact-resistant Innegra fibers, they say these rims still pass a higher-than-necessary impact test without fracturing.
