That training would, by definition, involve making \"unauthorized copies\" of \"Carlin's original, copyrighted routines\" without permission in order \"to fabricate a semblance of Carlin’s voice and generate a Carlin stand-up comedy routine,\" according to the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>\"Defendants’ AI-generated 'George Carlin Special' is not a creative work,\" the lawsuit reads, in part. \"It is a piece of computer-generated click-bait which detracts from the value of Carlin’s comedic works and harms his reputation. It is a casual theft of a great American artist’s work.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999215#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999215&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dee5151374ae6ceae286d6cd7a24ae3cf8fa8bfc0b9c0c0e369462ec1eb7f783","category":"Tech"}
