He said a key new feature of the M4 chip will be an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/\">upgraded Neural Engine</a> that boosts performance for AI tasks, and he believes Apple will market the next ‌iPad Pro‌ as an AI-powered device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIntroducing the M4 chip in an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> and only six months after the previous chip generation would be unprecedented moves. Yet this is not the first time that the new ‌iPad Pro‌ models have been rumored to feature the M4 chip. In March, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/chip-details-of-16-upcoming-apple-devices-revealed/\">chip details of 16 new Apple devices</a> were revealed by a source with a proven track record of sharing accurate information about Apple's plans.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe disclosed technical information contained four identifiers for an unreleased chip that relates to the upcoming 11- and 13-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models display sizes. This sequence of identifiers suggested that the ‌iPad Pro‌ will contain the M4 chip, rather than the M3. With Gurman now supporting this possibility and the potential of an AI focus, it seems like an increasingly likely eventuality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf Apple does introduce the M4 chip in the new ‌iPad Pro‌, its Apple silicon roadmap would appear to be moving faster than expected. It is possible that TSMC's N3E production volume remains low, making it more suitable for a device like the ‌iPad‌ rather than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or Mac at this point in time. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce the new ‌iPad Pro‌ models at its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/\">\"Let Loose\" event on May 7</a>.
