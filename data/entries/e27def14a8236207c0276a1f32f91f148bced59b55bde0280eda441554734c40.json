It's not clear what changed, but <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290703/apple-green-bubble-message-reaction-rcs-android\">The Verge</a></em> says that something that Google or Apple tweaked made it work as of this week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen an Android user uses an emoji reaction to a message that you've sent over ‌RCS‌, the emoji will now show up in line with the message bubble, just like it does on with iOS Tapback reactions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrior to now, if an Android user used an emoji reaction to a message in a conversation with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> user, the emoji would show up on a separate line, which was confusing and not how the feature was meant to work.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>The Verge</em> says it tested emoji reactions between iPhones running iOS 18.1 and several different Android phones, and reactions display both ways as intended.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/\">RCS</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/green-bubble-emoji-reactions/\">Green Bubble Emoji Reactions From Android Users Now Show Up Properly on iPhones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/green-bubble-emoji-reactions-from-android-users-now-show-up-properly-on-iphones.2442395/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e27def14a8236207c0276a1f32f91f148bced59b55bde0280eda441554734c40","category":"Apple"}
