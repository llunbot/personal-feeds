{"title":"The MacRumors Show: Talking Through watchOS 10's Huge Redesign","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/05/the-macrumors-show-watchos-10-redesign/","date":1683304382000,"content":"On this week's episode of <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/watchos-10s-huge-redesign/id1602394741?i=1000611896581\">The MacRumors Show</a>, we talk through some of the key aspects rumored for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a>'s substantial UI redesign.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div>\r<br />\nLast week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> reported that ‌watchOS 10‌ will introduce an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/30/gurman-widgets-to-be-central-part-watchos-10/\">all-new system of widgets</a> for interacting with the Apple Watch. He explained that widgets will become a \"central part\" of the Apple Watch's interface and compared the new system to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/add-glances-apple-watch/\">Glances</a>, the widgets interface that launched on the original Apple Watch before being scrapped in watchOS 3, and the style of widgets that iOS 14 brought to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also apparently testing changes to the functions performed by the Apple Watch's buttons. For example, a press of the Digital Crown may now launch the new widgets view, rather than navigate to the home screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new interface will apparently be \"reminiscent\" of the ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>‌ watch face that was introduced in watchOS 4, but as an overlay for any Apple Watch face. \"It's also similar to widget stacks, a feature in iOS and iPadOS that lets users pile many widgets into one and scroll through them,\" Gurman added.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are also rumors about ‌watchOS 10‌ introducing a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/watchos-10-new-home-screen-layout-rumor/\">new home screen layout</a> that takes cues from iOS with features like app folders. The changes are part of what is expected to be one of the Apple Watch's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/16/watchos-10-major-update-gurman/\">biggest software updates</a> since its introduction and the most significant change to the Apple Watch this year, as only minor hardware updates are expected to be unveiled later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe consider how this new UI could take shape and how we feel about the proposed changes, reflecting on Glances, watchOS 4's ‌Siri‌ watch face, past changes to the Apple Watch's buttons, and the future of apps on the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe also discuss some of the latest Apple news, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/02/apple-to-expand-unwanted-tracking-alerts/\">expansion of AirTag-like tracking alerts</a> to third-party devices, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>'s rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/28/ios-17-health-wallet-app-mockups/\">Wallet and Health app redesigns</a>, and the delay of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/27/apple-watch-ultra-second-half-2025/\">microLED Apple Watch Ultra to 2025</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nListen to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> in <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1602394741\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/41XOHIA6w8IxAKJZvrnx90\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1602394741\">Overcast</a>, <a href=\"https://pca.st/itunes/1602394741\">Pocket Casts</a>, <a href=\"https://castro.fm/itunes/1602394741\">Castro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcGxheWxpc3QvNjk1NTlmZTgtMzMxOC00ZDI5LTkyMmYtYWJlMTAwNjhjYTYzLzg1OTRmODNjLTBkN2QtNDhkOS04OTcxLWFkZmEwMTAzOWEzMS9kODA4NmM5Ni1iNmQ4LTRkNWMtYTZiMy1hZGZhMDEwM2M4NmQvcG9kY2FzdC5yc3M%3d\">Google Podcasts</a>, or your preferred podcasts app. You can also <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channels/5096144.rss\">copy our RSS feed</a> directly into your podcast player.
