{"title":"Apple Acquires Classical Music Specialty Label BIS Records","link":"https://www.bis.se/","date":1694027582000,"content":"\n<p>Robert von Bahr, founder of BIS Records:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A few days ago BIS Records turned 50 years old and I am immensely\nproud of what our small team of people has accomplished during\nthis half-century. BIS’s specialty, while paying our dues to the\ncore repertoire, has been to nurture young classical artists and\ninteresting living composers and to safeguard the musical treasure\nthat we all represent long into the future. It is to that end\nthat, after much careful consideration, and having just turned 80,\nI am excited to announce the rather momentous news that we have\nmade the decision to become part of the Apple family.</p>\n\n<p>We thought long and hard on how to maintain and build upon our\nprestigious history and looked for a partner who would further our\nmission, as well as an increased global platform to bring\nclassical music to new audiences all over the world. Apple, with\nits own storied history of innovation and love of music, is the\nideal home to usher in the next era of classical and has shown\ntrue commitment towards building a future in which classical music\nand technology work in harmony. It is my vision and my sincerest\ndream that we are all a part of this future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now <em>this</em> is an Apple-style acquisition.
