This epic, and rather dangerous, journey took her 10 days 14 hours and 56 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We caught up with Maria to hear all about her record setting journey, the highs and the lows, what cycling in Antarctica is really like, and how she ended up deciding it was a good idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maria also talks about her other adventures, including taking on the Siberian Black Ice Race ,which included cycling across Lake Baikal the deepest frozen freshwater lake in the world. It makes the recent frost in the UK seem a little meagre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also an exclusive chat about Mrs Chippy. Intrigued?
