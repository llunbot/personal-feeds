But they don't provide a permanent solution at a time when tech companies appear determined to chase profits by building ever-more-sophisticated AI models that increasingly threaten to dilute artists' brands and replace them in the market.</p>\n<p>In one high-profile example just last month, the estate of Ansel Adams condemned Adobe for selling AI images stealing the famous photographer's style, Smithsonian <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ansel-adams-estate-condemns-adobe-for-selling-ai-generated-images-mimicking-the-photographers-style-180984473/\">reported</a>. Adobe quickly responded and removed the AI copycats. But it's not just famous artists who risk being ripped off, and lesser-known artists may struggle to prove AI models are referencing their works. In this <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/rapid-growth-of-ai-systems-prompts-us-copyright-office-to-seek-public-input/\">largely lawless world</a>, every image uploaded risks contributing to an artist's downfall, potentially watering down demand for their own work each time they promote new pieces online.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034684#p3\">Read 56 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034684&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8ecbbccfc6ae176c1f97a46d46c3bf7188882cf78d522fad1c58cdd4fa1e6b2b","category":"Tech"}
