Simply put, that’s where the bulk of the carbon fiber bicycle manufacturing expertise is, particularly for mass production. And, to be fair, shifting production there is something they’ve been working on for more than a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d like to hear it in their words, I visited their HQ in Arkansas for an updated tour, check it out:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/allied-tour-2023/\">my prior factory tour</a> to see how they were making the bikes near Bentonville, AR. If you prefer pics and paraphrasing, here are my thoughts and photos from the visit…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The short of it is this: Allied Cycles used to design, engineer, test, manufacture, finish, paint, assemble, and ship their bikes from Rogers, Arkansas, near Bentonville.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, they design, engineer, test, finish, paint, assemble, and ship their bikes in Rogers, Arkansas. The only thing missing from the original list is the manufacturing, and even that’s not 100% true.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-2.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of allied cycles duet handlebar and stem combo.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-2.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-2-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-2-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re still machining the alloy parts like linkages, stems, and other bits in house. These get installed during assembly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a design standpoint, Allied’s CEO, Drew Medlock, says that they’re still doing all initial design, prototyping, and testing 100% in house. But now they’re also able to tap into the manufacturing expertise at the foreign factory when finalizing the layup, combining brainpower to yield a better final product.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-1-QC.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-1-QC.webp\" alt=\"allied cycles HQ tour quality control room.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-1-QC.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-1-QC-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-1-QC-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-1-QC-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-1-QC-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the raw carbon frames are made in China, then shipped back to Allied’s HQ for inspection. For now, every single frame is checked for tolerances, with every port, hole, thread, and component attachment point physically checked with pass/fail measurement tools. Every frame is weighed, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re also inspected for blemishes and other cosmetic and structural issues, then accepted or rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-2-sanding.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-2-sanding.webp\" alt=\"allied cycles HQ tour sanding and polishing room.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-2-sanding.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-2-sanding-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-2-sanding-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-2-sanding-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-2-sanding-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, they move onto sanding to prep the frame for paint (back right station).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-8-robot-sanding.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-8-robot-sanding.webp\" alt=\"allied cycles HQ tour robot sanding room.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-8-robot-sanding.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-8-robot-sanding-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-8-robot-sanding-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-8-robot-sanding-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-8-robot-sanding-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re still using their robot to sand the bikes. In this pic (above), the color-coded sections on the frame represent a different sanding tool inside the room, and they’re training it on the new Able. Each frame and frame size needs its own program, then, the robot can smooth most of the frame to prep it for paint.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-7-masking.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-7-masking.webp\" alt=\"allied cycles HQ tour paint masking room.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-7-masking.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-7-masking-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-7-masking-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-7-masking-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-HQ-tour-2025-7-masking-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frames are painted, with any masking done to create the painted logos.

And they’re continuing to make the alloy stem in-house, along with suspension linkages and other small parts. This lets them make custom stem angles and lengths for their sponsored athletes like Kate Courtney and Payson McElveen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Duet is <a href=\"https://alliedcycleworks.com/collections/gear/products/allied-duet-mtb-bar-stem\" target=\"_blank\">sold only as a combo</a>, and it’s insanely light, with a bar plus stem coming in as light as 200g… for the pair! That’s lighter than most one-piece bar+stem combos on the market, and it offers full adjustability and stem length options.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-6.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-6.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of allied cycles duet handlebar and stem combo.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-6.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-6-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-6-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-6-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-6-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their secret is a unique stem design that fully envelops the handlebar in the face, with only a single clamping section at the bottom. And that clamping section is unique in that it dips down, away from the bar, to remove any pressure points or sharp edges against the carbon.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-5.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-5.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of allied cycles duet handlebar and stem combo.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-5.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-5-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-5-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-5-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-5-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That lets them reduce the amount of carbon fiber used in the center section, which they say isn’t necessary to reinforce the bar since they’re not using a standard stem that clamps from front and back… something they verified with FEA.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-4.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-4.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of allied cycles duet handlebar and stem combo.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-4.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-4-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-4-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-4-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/allied-duet-handlebar-stem-combo-4-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another cool feature is the integrated cycling computer mounting bolts on the top, so you don’t need to clamp that around the bar, either. It’s available separately for $325 with a computer mount included (choose Garmin or Wahoo…but you can rotate to switch).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://alliedcycleworks.com\" target=\"_blank\">AlliedCycleWorks.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/heres-why-allied-cycles-moved-production-to-asia/\">Here’s Why Allied Cycles Moved Production to Asia</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"2b66eaf0a324b1785a8b9c221be0824f65db645a662186c37841b65b44375c7a","category":"Cycling"}
