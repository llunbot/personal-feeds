The timing would position it just a few months ahead of the launch of Apple's so-called <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/\">iPhone 17 'Air'</a>, expected in September 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince the Korean report, <em><a href=\"https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/samsungs-mysterious-galaxy-s25-slim-smartphone-officially-spotted-for-first-time/\">Smartprix</a></em> has discovered a smartphone listing in the GSMA IMEI database under the market name \"Galaxy\" with the model number SM-S937U. According to the outlet, Samsung often registers smartphones it is testing internally in this database about six to seven months before their official launch. The model number is said to match the pattern seen in Samsung's standard Galaxy, Plus, and Ultra series devices, but it will likely be launched separately from its main Galaxy S25 series to avoid cannibalization of sales. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt won't be the first time Samsung has experimented with thin designs â€“ back in 2014, the company released the Galaxy Alpha, which featured a 6.7mm profile compared to the regular Galaxy S5's 8.1mm thickness. Industry sources claim that Samsung views its latest attempt as a strategic move to reinvigorate the smartphone market amid plateauing demand. The company reportedly plans to gauge market response to the slim model before potentially restructuring its entire Galaxy S26 lineup in 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been conflicting rumors about the design and specifications for Apple's rumored slim device, but most sources have agreed that it will have around a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/\">6.6-inch display</a>. In July, Apple supply chain analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said he expects the device to have a standard A19 chip, a Dynamic Island, a single rear camera, and an Apple-designed 5G modem. The official name of the model is not yet known.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/\">iPhone 17 Air: Everything We Know About Apple's Slim iPhone</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThe timing of both releases suggests 2025 could mark the beginning of a new focus on device thinness from the two major smartphone rivals, after years of emphasis on improved camera capabilities and processing power.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/samsung-ultra-thin-galaxy-s25-iphone-17-air-rival/\">Samsung Planning Ultra-Thin Galaxy S25 Model to Rival iPhone 17 Air</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-planning-ultra-thin-galaxy-s25-model-to-rival-iphone-17-air.2442206/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3526c24b9e60ebaabd6eae19feaaadc0fabc31095edd532751638525dfd01292","category":"Apple"}
