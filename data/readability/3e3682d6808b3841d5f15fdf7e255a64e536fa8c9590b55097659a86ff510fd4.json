The new threads boast some thoughtful and precise updates to MAAP’s earlier renditions, and are once again meant for training—not racing. Not that you couldn’t race in this kit, but the point is creating something more comfortable and functional for your daily grind.</p><h2>MAAP Training Collection kit update</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16144739/Female_Training-Jersey_Haze_PDP_LIFESTYLE_01_DESKTOP-e1631819946346.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16144739/Female_Training-Jersey_Haze_PDP_LIFESTYLE_01_DESKTOP-e1631819946346.jpg\" alt=\"maap training collection kit ss women's jersey in purple\" width=\"1185\" height=\"813\"></a></p><p>This update zeroes in on all the details that you don’t know you need until it’s too late. For the serious rider, subtle construction features can make (or, more often, break) a successful ride. MAAP says its <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/09/30/fall-clothing-from-rapha-state-co-snek/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cycling kits</a> won’t just improve rider comfort; they’ll bolster performance — especially noticeable when the going gets blurry.</p><p>The jerseys and bib shorts each have durable, moisture-wicking Italian fabric that’s sustainably made and bluesign-certified. The proprietary ‘Team Fit’ four-way-stretch and low-profile flatlock stitching mean that each piece is long-lasting and will keep its shape ride after ride.</p><p>The addition and strategic placement of reflective graphics ensure greater visibility and security on the road. MAAP also enhanced each thread’s ability to hold on to its original, bold color through seasons of sweat, tears, and wash cycles.</p><p>Women’s kits come in black, haze, navy, sage, or sky tones. Men’s are black, burgundy, flame, light olive, or navy.</p><h2>Training Collection features</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16145716/Male_TrainingJersey_Black_PDP_LIFESTYLE_02_MOBILE-e1631818877800.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16145716/Male_TrainingJersey_Black_PDP_LIFESTYLE_02_MOBILE-e1631818877800.jpg\" alt=\"maap training collection mens bib and ss jersey\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16145716/Male_TrainingJersey_Black_PDP_LIFESTYLE_02_MOBILE-e1631818877800.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16145716/Male_TrainingJersey_Black_PDP_LIFESTYLE_02_MOBILE-e1631818877800-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16145716/Male_TrainingJersey_Black_PDP_LIFESTYLE_02_MOBILE-e1631818877800-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16145716/Male_TrainingJersey_Black_PDP_LIFESTYLE_02_MOBILE-e1631818877800-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16145716/Male_TrainingJersey_Black_PDP_LIFESTYLE_02_MOBILE-e1631818877800-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><strong>Training Short Sleeve Jersey ($113/AUD 155)</strong></p><ul><li>Signature Team Fit</li><li>SPF50+ protection</li><li>Moisture Wicking Technology</li><li>Breathable</li><li>Set in sleeve for superior fit</li><li>Low profile collar</li><li>Internal elastic waist hem with MAAP silicone logos</li></ul><p><strong>Training Long Sleeve Thermal Jersey ($142/AUD 195)</strong></p><ul><li>Signature Team Fit</li><li>Premium Italian thermal fabric</li><li>3 back pockets</li><li>Reflective logo details</li><li>Exposed YKK Vislon zip with lock</li><li>SPF 50+ sun protection factor</li></ul><p><strong>Training Bib Short ($139/AUD 190)</strong></p><ul><li>Ergonomically engineered chamois</li><li>Breathable and moisture-wicking fabrics</li><li>Lightweight mesh braces for ventilation</li><li>Rubber Screenprint logo</li><li>Elastic leg hem band with printed silicone gripper</li></ul><h2>Pedal meets mettle</h2><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/603688137?h=b0e9d0e9b3\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p>When it came time to wring the kit out, MAAP tapped big-time pros Abby-Mae Parkinson and Jon Dibben. The cyclists returned with glowy-sounding responses.</p><p>“I’ve known a lot of riders and teammates who have had issues with their kit, and it’s affecting their training, it’s affecting their racing,” said former track world champion Dibben. “It’s no good doing all the nutrition stuff and all the training when you’re constantly having to adjust your kit every twelve seconds, something we definitely did not experience in the new MAAP Training Jerseys.”</p><p>Parkinson emphasized the significance of the kit — which is only as performative as the sum of its parts. “I’ve been in a situation where a teammate has abandoned a race because she could no longer sit in the saddle. In that light, it’s easy to see why it’s so important to have the right kit that’s not only comfortable but also durable, especially through things like the unpredictable quality of roads,” she remarked.</p><h2>Availability</h2><p>MAAP’s latest Training Collection jerseys and bibs are available now through <a href=\"https://maap.cc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MAAP.cc</a> and local MAAP retail partners.</p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Jilli Cluff","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"3e3682d6808b3841d5f15fdf7e255a64e536fa8c9590b55097659a86ff510fd4","category":"Cycling"}
