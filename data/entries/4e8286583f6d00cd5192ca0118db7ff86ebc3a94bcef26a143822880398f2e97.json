These would be the first Apple-branded consumer-level external displays since Apple stopped selling the Thunderbolt Display in 2016.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMost of the information shared by @dylandkt today lines up with previous rumors from display industry analyst Ross Young, who just this week said that Apple is planning to release a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-imac-pro-spring-2022/\">new 27-inch iMac with a mini-LED display</a> in the first half of 2022. <em>9to5Mac</em> also reported that Apple was working on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/23/apple-developing-external-display-with-a13-chip/\">new Pro Display XDR with an A13 chip</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dylandkt/\">dylandkt</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/15/lg-pro-display-xdr-apple-silicon-chip-rumor/\">LG Possibly Developing Three New Apple Displays, Including Pro Display XDR With Apple Silicon Chip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lg-possibly-developing-three-new-apple-displays-including-pro-display-xdr-with-apple-silicon-chip.2327741/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AZAqMFVrJho:Fv-ebI6Mp4k:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AZAqMFVrJho:Fv-ebI6Mp4k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4e8286583f6d00cd5192ca0118db7ff86ebc3a94bcef26a143822880398f2e97","category":"Apple"}
