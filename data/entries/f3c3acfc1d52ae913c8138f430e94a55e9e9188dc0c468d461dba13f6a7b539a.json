{"title":"Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering – Improved Cost Optimizations for Short-Lived and Small Objects","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-intelligent-tiering-further-automating-cost-savings-for-short-lived-and-small-objects/","date":1630597179000,"content":"<p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-automatic-cost-optimization-for-amazon-s3-via-intelligent-tiering/\">we first launched</a> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/#Unknown_or_changing_access\">Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering)</a>. For customers managing data across business units, teams, and products, unpredictable access patterns are often the norm. With the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class, <span>S3</span> automatically optimizes costs by moving data between access tiers as access patterns change.</p> \n<p>Today, we’re pleased to announce two updates to further enhance savings.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>S3 Intelligent-Tiering now has no minimum storage duration period for all objects.</li> \n <li>Monitoring and automation charges are no longer collected for objects smaller than 128 KB.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><span><strong>How Does this Benefit Customers?</strong></span><br /> Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering can be used to store shared datasets, where data is aggregated and accessed by different applications, teams, and individuals, whether for analytics, machine learning, real-time monitoring, or other data lake use cases.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/08/31/how_it_works.png\"><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/08/31/how_it_works.png\" /></a></p> \n<p>With these use cases, it’s common that many users within an organization will store data with a wide range of objects and delete subsets of data in less than 30 days.</p> \n<p>To date, S3 Intelligent-Tiering was intended for objects larger than 128 KB stored for a minimum of 30 days. As of today, monitoring and automation charges will no longer be collected for objects smaller than 128 KB — this includes both new and already existing objects in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. Additionally, objects deleted, transitioned, or overwritten within 30 days will no longer accrue prorated charges.</p> \n<p>With these changes, S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period.</p> \n<p><span><strong>How Can I Use This Now?</strong></span><br /> S3 Intelligent-Tiering can either be applied to objects individually, as they are written to <span>S3</span> by adding the Intelligent-Tiering header to the PUT request for your object, or through the creation of a lifecycle rule.</p> \n<p>One way you can explore the benefits of S3 Intelligent-Tiering is through the <a href=\"https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home\">Amazon S3 Console</a>.</p> \n<p>Once there, select a bucket you wish to upload an object to and store with the S3 Intelligent-Tiering class, then select the <strong>Upload</strong> button on the object display view. This will take you to a page where you can upload files or folders to <span>S3</span>.</p> \n<p>You can drag and drop or use either the <strong>Add Files</strong> or <strong>Add Folders</strong> button to upload objects to your bucket. Once selected, you will see a view like the following image.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/09/01/S3upload.png\"><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/09/01/S3upload.png\" /></a></p> \n<p>Next, scroll down the page and expand the <strong>Properties</strong> section. Here, we can select the storage class we wish for our object (or objects) to be stored in. Select <strong>Intelligent-Tiering</strong> from the storage class options list. Then select the <strong>Upload</strong> button at the bottom of the page.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/09/01/properties.png\"><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/09/01/properties.png\" /></a></p> \n<p>Your objects will now be stored in your <span>S3</span> bucket utilizing the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class, further optimizing costs by moving data between access tiers as access patterns change.</p> \n<p><span>S3</span> Intelligent-Tiering is available in all AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions, the AWS China (Beijing) Region, operated by Sinnet, and the AWS China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD.
