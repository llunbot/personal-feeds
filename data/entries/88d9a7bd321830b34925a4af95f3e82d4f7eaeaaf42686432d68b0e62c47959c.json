It’s not a real product, and the product page isn’t on Apple.com anymore (but it <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250326175811/https://www.apple.com/mac/lumon-terminal-pro/\">lives forever</a> in the Internet Archive). <span>However, what is real is the <a href=\"https://www.atomickb.com/sign-up\" target=\"_blank\">MDR Dasher Keyboard</a>, a replica of the keyboard used by</span> Lumon employees in the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Atomic Keyboard, the MDR Dasher Keyboard is inspired by the<a href=\"https://www.pdp-11.nl/dg/d200/dasher200.html\"> Data General Dasher 200</a>, a computer terminal from the 1970s. The MDR Dasher is clad in three shades of blue and even features the trackball used to move the cursor. The keyboard “boasts a unique 73-key, 70% layout with no Escape, no Control, and no Options keys.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those missing keys might be problematic for users relying on key combos. Also, it’s not clear if the top row on the MDR Dasher will be a set of F keys–it seems like it would, but you can’t tell from the photo. The website says the keyboard will be “incorporating modern features for today’s computing needs” so it’s possible the photos aren’t of the final product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MDR Dasher Keyboard will be available for macOS, Windows, and Linux, and will connect via USB-C. Atomic Keyboard has not announced a price or a ship date, but you can <a href=\"https://www.atomickb.com/sign-up\">sign up for a notification</a> when the keyboard becomes available.
