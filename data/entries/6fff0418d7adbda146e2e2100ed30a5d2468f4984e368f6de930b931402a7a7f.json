{"title":"Kuo: New HomePod With Smart Home Display Arriving in Late 2025","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/kuo-homepod-display-coming-late-2025/","date":1733306262000,"content":"Apple's long-rumored HomePod with a display has been delayed again and is now expected to launch after WWDC 2025, likely in the third quarter of the year, according to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/smart-home-market-becomes-apples-next-strategic-target-new-homepod-with-display-set-to-be-key-c92f44760a7c\">analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. This timeline is a shift from Kuo's earlier prediction of a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/\">2024 release</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Second-Generation-HomePod-With-Top-LCD-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" /><div><em>MacRumors concept render</em></div>\r<br />\nThe new smart speaker is expected to feature Apple's A18 processor and a 6-7 inch display, with support for Apple Intelligence, says the analyst. According to Kuo, the delay is primarily attributed to software development challenges, rather than hardware issues.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been rumors about a â€ŒHomePod with a display since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/\">2021</a>, and Apple actually seems to have several products in the works. Kuo's latest report harks back to previous predictions from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, who suggested Apple was developing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/homepod-with-ipad-like-screen-2025-rumor/\">several HomePod variants with screens</a>, including one with an iPad-like display and another featuring a screen mounted on a robotic arm. Gurman had indicated these devices were unlikely to launch before 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new HomePod will reportedly emphasize smart home functionality more than current models, suggesting a strategic repositioning of the product line. The idea that Apple is targeting the smart home market follows a recent report by Gurman about Apple developing an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">all-in-one home management hub</a> with a square-shaped display, thick bezels, and a hemispherical base similar to the iMac G4.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInitial shipment expectations for the new HomePod are relatively modest, with Kuo forecasting approximately 500,000 units in the second half of 2025. He also maintains his previous prediction that Apple will launch a compatible smart home IP camera in 2026 that is designed to work wirelessly with the display-equipped HomePod.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/kuo-homepod-display-coming-late-2025/\">Kuo: New HomePod With Smart Home Display Arriving in Late 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-new-homepod-with-smart-home-display-arriving-in-late-2025.2444583/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6fff0418d7adbda146e2e2100ed30a5d2468f4984e368f6de930b931402a7a7f","category":"Apple"}
