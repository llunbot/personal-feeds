The <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/logic-pro-for-ipad/\">Logic Pro audio-editing software</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro-for-ipad/\">Final Cut Pro video-editing software</a> are making the jump to the iPad with multi-touch-optimized interfaces and Apple Pencil support.</p>\n<p>Both apps will be available on the App Store starting May 23 for either $5 per month or $50 per year. Each will also have a one-month free trial available.</p>\n<p>Both apps have more stringent system requirements than the GarageBand and iMovie apps. Logic Pro will run on any iPad with at least an A12 Bionic chip, including the 8th-generation iPad, the 3rd-generation iPad Air, the 5th-generation iPad mini, and newer models. Final Cut Pro is more demanding and requires an iPad Pro or Air with an M1 or M2â€”presumably, it's the small amount of RAM included with older iPads that keeps them from running software that much slower Macs have managed to run for years.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937669#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937669&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"35c3983e63a4df6cf8e5113d30d14c359033c2ca01ce51c92dbd002ab761e17c","category":"Tech"}
