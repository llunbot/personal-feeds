ColorWare is known for its custom-painted Apple accessories and products like AirPods, and the company sometimes does unique limited edition designs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/colorware-crayon-pro-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1776\" height=\"1000\" />\r<br />\nThe ColorWare Apple Crayon Pro is available in seven colors, including black, mint, pink, purple, red, white, and yellow. Each one has a custom colored tip and a matching wrapper, all of which is painted on a standard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> Pro. ColorWare previously did a custom ‌Apple Pencil‌ designed to look like a <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/products/colorware-apple-number-2-pencil-pro\">number 2 pencil</a>, but the custom crayons in multiple colors are even more fun. With the attention to design, the Apple Crayon Pro does indeed look quite a bit like an actual crayon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/colorware-crayon-pro-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1776\" height=\"1000\" />\r<br />\nColorWare has been customizing Apple devices for more than a decade, and it has perfected the process for a lasting finish. ColorWare uses a multi-step coating system, including a primer, a proprietary color formula, and a liquid plastic coating to protect the color. All products are warrantied for 12 months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/colorware-crayon-pro-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nBecause ColorWare is using a standard ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro, all of the functionality of the ‌Apple Pencil‌ remains intact. The ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro works with the M4 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> and M3 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> models, and the A17 Pro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nColorWare is selling the Apple Crayon Pro for $215, and all colors are <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/collections/colorware-apple-crayon-pros\">available from the ColorWare website</a> as of today.
