Setting up a recovery key is one alternative solution, but in such cases you can't change your password unless you have a trusted second device as well as the recovery key.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn an effort to make things easier, Apple allows you to set up an account recovery contact that can help make sure you always have access to your account, even if you forget your Apple Account password or device passcode. Your recovery contact is someone who can verify your identity and help you regain access to your account and all of your data if you ever get locked out. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Who Should Be My Recovery Contact?</h2>\r<br />\nYour recovery contact should be a person you know and trust, such as a family member or a close friend. They will need an iOS device of their own running iOS 15 or iPadOS 15 or later, or a Mac running macOS Monterey or later, and they must be over the age of 13. They'll also need two-factor authentication turned on for their own account and a passcode set up on their device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Invite Someone to Be Your Recovery Contact</h2>\r<br />\nNote: If you're on a Mac, you can find the same options as above in <strong>System Settings ➝ Apple Account</strong>.\r<br />\n<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device and tap your Apple Account banner at the top of the main menu.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Sign In &amp; Security</strong>.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/ios-create-recovery-contact1.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"2760\" height=\"2760\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>Under \"Recovery Methods,\" tap <strong>Recovery Contacts</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Read the onscreen information, then tap <strong>Add Recovery Contact...</strong> and authenticate.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/ios-create-recovery-contact2.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"2760\" height=\"2760\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>Choose a recovery contact.

On Mac, the same options can be found in <strong>System Settings ➝ Apple Account</strong>.\r<br />\n<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device and tap your Apple Account banner at the top of the main menu.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Sign In &amp; Security ➝ Account Recovery</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Under \"Account Recovery For,\" tap the person's name.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Remove Contact</strong>.</li></ol>After completing these steps, the contact will automatically receive a message explaining that you're no longer their account recovery contact.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>Note:</b> To set up the recovery contact feature, all of the Apple devices associated with your account must be upgraded to iOS 15/iPadOS 15 or later, or macOS Monterey or later.
