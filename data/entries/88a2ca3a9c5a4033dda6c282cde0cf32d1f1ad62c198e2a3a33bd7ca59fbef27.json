The route is roughly 839 miles long with 34,626 feet of elevation, including two mountains.</p>\n<p>The End to End record has been regulated by the Road Records Association since 1881 and in its 140-year history, there have been fewer than 30 successful attempts by men and women.</p>\n<p>The women’s record was beaten in July this year by Christina Mackenzie, who completed the course in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/christina-mackenzie-lejog-record/\">51 hours, five minutes and 27 seconds</a>, beating Lynne Biddulph’s (née Taylor) record that had stood since 2002.</p>\n<p>Gethin Butler beat the men’s record in 2001 with a time of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds. For a long time, this record was deemed unbreakable – a feat of pure superhuman endurance and mind over matter riding.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/cyclings-unbreakable-record-michael-broadwith-3-80336f2.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>After passing through Kendal, Broadwith climbed Shap Fell in the early hours of the morning. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Paul Jones</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/cyclings-unbreakble-record-michael-broadwith-4-d2e2de9.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=550%2C715\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Broadwith was “high on the adrenaline” when he stopped at the top of the climb.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Paul Jones</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/cyclings-unbreakable-record-gethin-butler-09e85c1.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Gethin Butler came out to support Broadwith on his record attempt. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Paul Jones</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/cyclings-unbreakable-record-micahel-broadwaith-2-7b4e97f.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>As fatigue set in, Broadwith wanted to take more breaks just to talk to his support team.

The poetic quality of seeing a route spanning the length of the country, its rich history and the sense of it being a journey many others have ridden before him, drove Broadwith to try and break Butler’s record in 2018.</p>\n<p>Behind the record attempt there is a huge emotional, financial and training investment. There is also the need for the self-belief that you are a serious contender, to justify not only taking yourself to the start line but a full support team.</p>\n<p>In <em>Cycling’s Unbreakable Record</em>, Broadwith describes how finally announcing his intention to make a record attempt was like stepping on a conveyor belt that you can’t stop.</p>\n<p>What happens next is close to two days of relentless riding; no sleep, indescribable pain and fatigue, and febrile euphoria.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"88a2ca3a9c5a4033dda6c282cde0cf32d1f1ad62c198e2a3a33bd7ca59fbef27","category":"Cycling"}
