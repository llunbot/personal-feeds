Apple issued the following statement about its decision:<blockquote>Last month we announced plans for features intended to help protect children from predators who use communication tools to recruit and exploit them, and limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material. Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing their announcement, the features were criticized by a wide range of individuals and organizations, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/security-researchers-alarmed-apple-csam-plans/\">security researchers</a>, the privacy whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/snowden-eff-slam-plan-to-scan-messages-images/\">Edward Snowden</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/snowden-eff-slam-plan-to-scan-messages-images/\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF), Facebook's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/10/facebook-security-chief-discusses-controversy/\">former security chief</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/18/german-politician-letter-tim-cook-csam-scanning/\">politicians</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/19/policy-groups-urge-apple-abandon-csam-scanning/\">policy groups</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/20/university-researchers-csam-dangerous/\">university researchers</a>, and even some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/apple-employees-concerns-over-csam/\">Apple employees</a>. Apple has since endeavored to dispel misunderstandings and reassure users by releasing detailed information, sharing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/09/apple-faq-csam-detection-messages-scanning/\">FAQs</a>, various <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/apple-child-safety-features-new-details/\">new documents</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/federighi-confusion-around-child-safety-details/\">interviews</a> with company executives, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe suite of Child Safety Features were originally set to debut in the United States with an update to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-8/\">watchOS 8</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a>. It is now unclear when Apple plans to roll out the \"critically important\" features, but the company still appears to be intent on releasing them.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-child-safety-features/\">Apple child safety features</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/03/apple-delaying-rollout-of-child-safety-features/\">Apple Delays Rollout of Controversial Child Safety Features to Make Improvements</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-delays-rollout-of-controversial-child-safety-features-to-make-improvements.2309617/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bKDRThYjI4s:YcaTCSarXsQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bKDRThYjI4s:YcaTCSarXsQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/bKDRThYjI4s\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1d4a8ad0035e6dae62dc53f7a65e94565e90000678f85258906ad170dfff4214","category":"Apple"}
