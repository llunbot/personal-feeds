This week <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/amazon-sqs-dead-letter-queue-redrive-aws-sdk-cli/\" target=\"_blank\">we added support for AWS SDK and CLI for this feature</a>, allowing you to redrive the messages on the DLQ automatically, making it even easier to use this feature. You can read <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/a-new-set-of-apis-for-amazon-sqs-dead-letter-queue-redrive/\" target=\"_blank\">Seb’s blog post</a> about this new feature to learn how to get started.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Lambda</strong> – AWS Lambda now supports Ruby 3.2. Ruby 3.2 has many new improvements, for example, passing anonymous arguments to functions or having endless methods. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/ruby-3-2-runtime-now-available-in-aws-lambda/\" target=\"_blank\">Check out this blog post that goes in depth into each of the new features</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Fraud Detector</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/amazon-fraud-detector-event-orchestration-eventbridge/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Fraud Detector supports event orchestration with Amazon EventBridge</a>. This is a very important feature because now you can act on the different events that Fraud Detector emits, for example, send notifications to different stakeholders.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Glue</strong> – This week, AWS Glue made two important announcements. First, it announced <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/aws-glue-ray-generally-available/\" target=\"_blank\">the general availability of AWS Glue for Ray</a>, a new data integration engine option for AWS Glue. Ray is a popular new open-source compute framework that helps developers to scale their Python workloads. In addition, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/aws-glue-data-quality-generally-available/\" target=\"_blank\">AWS Glue announced AWS Glue Data Quality</a>, a new capability that automatically measures and monitors data lake and data pipeline quality.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/aws-container-image-signing/\" target=\"_blank\">AWS Signer and Amazon ECR announced a new feature that allows you to sign and verify container images</a>. You can use Signer to validate that only container images you have approved are deployed in your Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) clusters.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon QuickSight</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/06/amazon-quicksight-apis-automate-accelerate-assets-deployment/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon QuickSight now supports APIs to automate asset deployment,</a> so you can replicate the same QuickSight assets in multiple Regions and account easily. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/automate-and-accelerate-your-amazon-quicksight-asset-deployments-using-the-new-apis/\" target=\"_blank\">You can read more on how to use those APIs in this blog post</a>.</p> \n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a> \n<p><strong><span>Other AWS News</span></strong><br /> Some other updates and news that you may have missed:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Testing serverless applications</strong> – Testing serverless applications is one of those things that customers ask for guidance on from AWS.
