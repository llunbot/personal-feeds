Their opponent: the Los Angeles Dodgers, who will appear for <a href=\"https://champsorchumps.us/team/mlb/los-angeles-dodgers/championships#tab-all-finals\">the 22nd time</a>. This will be the 12th time the two teams have met in the World Series, but the first since 1981. (The Yankees won 8 of the previous 11.) A star-studded matchup with incredible history, to say the least. May the best team win.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/Jomboy_/status/1847993673981796428\">Jomboy’s pitch-by-pitch breakdown of Yankee hero Juan Soto’s series-clinching 3-run homer</a> with 2 outs in the 10th inning against the Cleveland Guardians Saturday night.
