Improvements to the DDI can enable thinner panel assemblies, lower heat output, and reduced power consumption – all of which are critical in compact devices like foldables with multiple displays. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMultiple sources now agree on key specifications for Apple's first foldable iPhone, including a 7.8-inch main display when unfolded and a 5.5-inch cover display. The consensus comes from analysts <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-foldable-macos-prediction/\">Jeff Pu</a>, as well as the Weibo leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/alleged-display-sizes-apple-foldable-iphone/\">Digital Chat Station</a>. The agreement on the details suggest Apple may have finalized significant aspects of the device's hardware.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to Kuo, the foldable iPhone will adopt a book-style design, opening horizontally like a Galaxy Z Fold, rather than the vertical clamshell form factor of Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nJeff Pu reports that the device has recently entered the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/\">New Product Introduction (NPI) phase</a> at Foxconn, a key stage in Apple's production timeline. Both Pu and Kuo anticipate mass production beginning in the fourth quarter of 2026, which opens the possibility of a limited launch as early as next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn terms of hardware, Kuo claims the foldable iPhone will feature two rear cameras, a single front-facing camera, and a Touch ID sensor integrated into the power button –suggesting Apple may skip Face ID for this model, likely to save internal space. It's expected to include a high-density battery and a titanium chassis, with the hinge constructed from a combination of titanium and stainless steel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for dimensions, Kuo believes the device will measure just 4.5mm thick when unfolded, and between 9mm and 9.5mm when closed, making it notably thin compared to current foldables.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's efforts to optimize hardware efficiency across its product lines are already in motion, with the iPhone 16e featuring its first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/\">custom-made C1 modem</a>. Apple said the C1 modem is the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-battery-life/\">most power-efficient iPhone modem ever</a>, and it has held up fine in both real-world and simulated 5G <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/apple-c1-modem-5g-speed-tests/\">speed test results</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is on a mission to make the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-plans-thinner-iphone-slimmer-macbook/\">thinnest possible devices</a> in each product category, beginning with the most recent iPad Pro and continuing later this year with the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, which is expected to be the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/\">second device to use the C1 modem</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/\">Naver</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/foldable-iphone-impressive-battery-life-thinness/\">Foldable iPhone to Feature Impressive Battery Life Despite Thinness</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-to-feature-impressive-battery-life-despite-thinness.2453662/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1be2f730f381c56ee69b6221dc37e5e1e5b3a5e86735e0ab0254187181e100ff","category":"Apple"}
