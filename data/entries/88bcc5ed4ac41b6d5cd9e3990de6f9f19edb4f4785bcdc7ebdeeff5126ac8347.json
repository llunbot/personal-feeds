Links can be opened on a non-Apple device using a web browser, so people with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or Mac can help you locate something that's lost, such as your luggage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌‌Find My‌‌ links that you share expire after a one-week period, and you can see how many people have viewed a link. Shared links stop working when an item is returned to you, when the link sharing date expires, or when you opt to stop sharing the location of an item. Share Item Location is end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, so Apple and accessory manufacturers are not able to view an item's location or information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has teamed up with airlines to add support for Share Item Location, and airlines that use the feature have staff that know what steps to follow to get a lost item back to its owner using the ‌Find My‌ feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAdditional airlines are planning to add support, including Qantas, Virgin Atlantic, Singapore Airlines, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/18/share-item-location-expanded-airline-support/\">Additional Airlines Add Support for Apple's Find My for Lost Luggage Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/additional-airlines-add-support-for-apples-find-my-for-lost-luggage-feature.2445741/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"88bcc5ed4ac41b6d5cd9e3990de6f9f19edb4f4785bcdc7ebdeeff5126ac8347","category":"Apple"}
