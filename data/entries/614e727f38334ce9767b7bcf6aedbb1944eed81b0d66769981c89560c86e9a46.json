By our last tallying, that includes over 8000 videos, spanning across every path of cycling culture. To make things a little easier to navigate, we’re starting to roll out some simple tweaks and large restructuring improvements over the next few weeks. The first sampling is currently available; <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">a new Video Category page</a>.</p>\n<p>You can access this by clicking the hamburger menu at the top right of the menu, or simply click the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/videos/\" target=\"_blank\">video category tag</a> on any video. This is where we’ll pin our video projects to the top. More granular breakdown of the content itself is on the way, too… </p>\n<p>And as always, if you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@theradavist666\" target=\"_blank\">like and subscribe to our YouTube channel</a>, it’ll help us make more documentaries like <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/from-biocrust-with-love-video/\" target=\"_blank\">From Biocrust, With Love</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/website-improvement-video-category-page/\">Website Improvement: Video Category Page</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"614e727f38334ce9767b7bcf6aedbb1944eed81b0d66769981c89560c86e9a46","category":"Cycling"}
