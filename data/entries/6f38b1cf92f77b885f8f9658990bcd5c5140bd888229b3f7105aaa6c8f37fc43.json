Despite persuasive evidence that they've produced the same chemical, the team indicates they see no sign of superconductivity, even down to extremely low temperatures.</p>\n<p>The failure will undoubtedly raise further questions about the original research, which came from a lab that had an earlier paper on superconductivity retracted.</p>\n<h2>Bold claims</h2>\n<p>The work is part of a growing body of literature on metals complexed with hydrogen. These hydrogen-rich chemicals can form at ambient conditions, but added pressure can force additional hydrogen atoms into the structure. The resulting high-pressure compounds have ingredients—spare electrons from the metal, light nuclei from the hydrogen—that are thought to favor the formation of Cooper pairs from the electrons, a key ingredient in superconductivity. And a number of hydrogen-rich chemicals have been found to superconduct at over 200 K (-75° C) if the pressure is high enough.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939605#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939605&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6f38b1cf92f77b885f8f9658990bcd5c5140bd888229b3f7105aaa6c8f37fc43","category":"Tech"}
