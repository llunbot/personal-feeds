A Galaxy SmartTag, if you haven't heard, is a Bluetooth tracker, just like a Tile or AirTag, but from Samsung. Previous versions have only worked with Samsung phones.</p>\n<p>The FCC listing features a picture of this thing, and unlike the square Tile-clone design of the original Galaxy SmartTag, this is definitely unique. It's a flat, pill-shaped device with a huge key ring hole at the top. It sort of looks like a <a href=\"https://www.visolproducts.com/visol-sidecut-double-guillotine-cigar-cutter-gunmetal/\">cigar cutter</a>. If that's actually a normal key ring-sized hole, this is about twice the size of an AirTag.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9-1.jpg\" alt /></div>\n          <p>\n            Samsung's new SmartTag.

When it's far away, you will rely on the device's smartphone network. Previously this device <a href=\"https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag2-bluetooth-sig-certification/\">popped up</a> in the Bluetooth SIG database, where it was listed with Bluetooth 5.3, which should make it more battery efficient than the old Bluetooth 5.1 tag.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957931#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957931&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d263df0c78885b2b584f5516fc54b90e62c6e58fecae1339b2caa9694cdd649a","category":"Tech"}
