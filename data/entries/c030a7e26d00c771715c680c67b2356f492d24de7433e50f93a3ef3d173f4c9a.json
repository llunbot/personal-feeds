{"title":"Norman Lear: The Mensch","link":"https://managingeditor.substack.com/p/the-mensch","date":1701977010000,"content":"\n<p>Dave Pell, writing at NextDraft about Norman Lear, who died at the ripe age of 101:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From his tours of duty during WWII to his sensational, culture \nchanging television creations, to his political activism, to the \ngood, decent, kind life he lived, Norman Lear represented the \ngreatest of the greatest generation. I was lucky enough to spend \nsome time with Norman. Yes, he was a comedic genius and maybe \ntelevision’s most important creator, but he was also a deeply \ninterested, open, curious, people person. He was great, and also \ngood. He truly lived the lyrics of the theme for his show One Day \nat a Time. <em>This is it. This is life, the one you get, so go and \nhave a ball.</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a career. He didn’t just create some of the best sitcoms on TV during his prime, he created <em>most</em> of the best sitcoms: <em>Sanford &amp; Son</em> (my dad’s favorite), <em>One Day at a Time</em>, <em>Maude</em>, <em>Good Times</em>, <em>Mary Hartman Mary Hartman</em>, <em>The Jeffersons</em>, and, of course, his masterpiece, <em>All in the Family</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Over at BoingBoing, <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2023/12/07/archie-bunkers-1970s-rant-sounds-eerily-identical-to-todays-gop-platform.html\">Mark Frauenfelder has a 50-year-old <em>All in the Family</em> clip</a> that, aside from Rob Reiner’s hairstyle, could have been recorded today. Archie Bunker was a more coherent Trump than Trump.</p>\n\n<p>(With Charlie Munger dying at 99, Henry Kissinger at 100, and now Lear at 101, I’d be nervous if I were a famous 102-year-old.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/alexedelman/status/1732438309316542927\">A delightful anecdote from Alex Edelman</a>, about Lear pitching him an idea for a new show at age 100.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/07/norman-lear\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c030a7e26d00c771715c680c67b2356f492d24de7433e50f93a3ef3d173f4c9a","category":"Tech"}
