{"title":"Apple Watch Series 9 to Feature Updated Processor Based on A15 Chip","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/apple-watch-series-9-updated-chip/","date":1683570107000,"content":"The upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a> will include a new processor based on the A15 chip that was first used in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> models, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>. Gurman shared the information in the <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/power-on\">new Discord channel</a> for his Power On newsletter subscribers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/09/apple-watch-series-8-trio.jpg\" alt width=\"1607\" height=\"904\" />\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a>, like the Series 7 before it, uses a chip that's essentially identical to the S6 chip that was used in the Apple Watch Series 6. Apple calls the ‌Apple Watch Series 8‌ chip the \"S8,\" but it is a two-year-old chip with no speed improvements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman says that the Series 9 chip will be a \"new processor\" rather than a rebranding of the prior-generation chip, and when asked whether the chip would be based on the A15 chip, he said that he believed that would be the case.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith an updated chip that's built using the A15 technology, the ‌Apple Watch Series 9‌ could see speed and efficiency improvements, resulting in quicker load times and better battery life. The new chip could help power some of the updated features that Apple plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">introduce in watchOS 10</a>. Apple is working on overhauling the watchOS interface in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a>, with a specific focus on a new widget system.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile we are expecting some notable changes to watchOS this year, the ‌Apple Watch Series 9‌ will be largely similar to the Series 8. No major design updates are expected, but we will see a modest speed boost due to the new chip.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/apple-watch-series-9-updated-chip/\">Apple Watch Series 9 to Feature Updated Processor Based on A15 Chip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-to-feature-updated-processor-based-on-a15-chip.2389003/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"535330e85cf540b735bcbce36c1a32ea23c16c8b98ed086ff78a9ed7bd474b89","category":"Apple"}
