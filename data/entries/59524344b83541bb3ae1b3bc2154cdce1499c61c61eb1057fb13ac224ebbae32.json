It shared its name with Scott’s lightweight race bike and borrowed similar characteristics: it was light, it was stiff and it handled almost as sharply as the race bike did.</p>\n<p>Since then the market has matured rapidly and a number of trends have come into play: ever-wider tyre clearances, MTB-inspired geometry, hidden cables and even aerodynamic styling. Scott says its new Addict Gravel incorporates all of the latest design features to bring the platform right up to date.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9851/scott-addict-gravel-bike-gallery#2\"><p><span>Image 3 of</span> 10</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/scottaddictgravel3_0.jpg?itok=5AnLV6UE\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 3 of </span>10</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Integration</h3>\n<p>The most visible update is to the Addict Gravel’s cable integration. The new bike uses a similar system at the front end to Scott’s Addict and Foil race bikes, which use versions of Syncros’s (Scott’s in-house components brand) Creston iC SL cockpit. Scott pairs this with a slimmed-down one-inch fork steerer.</p>\n<p>With the narrow steerer threading through a comparatively hefty 1.5-inch upper bearing, there is space for the cables that run from inside the cockpit to enter the frame through the bearing too. Therefore they can be entirely hidden and the front of the Addict Gravel can present an appreciably clean profile to the wind as well as the eye.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9851/scott-addict-gravel-bike-gallery#7\"><p><span>Image 8 of</span> 10</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/scottaddictgravel8_0.jpg?itok=i8LtJvn_\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 8 of </span>10</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>The Addict Gravel uses the Creston iC SL X variant of the component, which is brand new. Scott says the drops use a flare of 16° and the whole thing comes in at a light weight of 335g. The tops portion of the bar is apparently recessed so thicker gravel bar tape can be used for better shock absorption too.</p>\n<h3>Geometry</h3>\n<p>As the terrain gravel bikes get taken on gets ever gnarlier, brands are taking inspiration from cross-country mountain bike designs to produce bikes that are stable over rough ground but still turn responsively when required.</p>\n<p>The previous Addict Gravel used road-like geometry so Scott has looked to settle this down in the new bike to make it more assured over the rough stuff.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scott-sports.com/gb/en/products/bike-bikes-road-gravel-cx\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Check out the full Scott Addict Gravel range now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Scott says it has made the reach and fork rake longer and the bottom bracket lower but paired those tweaks with a shorter stem. This should keep the bike agile but improve stability over technical terrain.</p>\n<h3>Capability</h3>\n<p>Backing the geometric tweaks up, the Addict Gravel’s tyre clearance has been pushed out to 45mm so the bike can leverage the grip and cushion of bigger tyres. As the clearance is so large, 40mm tyres can be used with mudguards – in keeping with its more capable remit, Scott has specced the bike with proper mounts for this accessory.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9851/scott-addict-gravel-bike-gallery#3\"><p><span>Image 4 of</span> 10</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/scottaddictgravel4_0.jpg?itok=4WQJ64ii\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 4 of </span>10</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>Mounting options for bags and bottles have also been bumped up, with the new bike including points on the underside of the down tube and top tube as well as in more regular areas.</p>\n<p>Thanks to a detachable derailleur mounting plate, the bike can be run with either a 1x or 2x drivetrain and riders even have the option to play around with rotor sizes. The fork will fit 180mm or 160mm rotors while the rear will take 140mm or 160mm sizes.</p>\n<p>Scott looks to have considered every aspect when it comes to the modularity that is desirable on modern gravel bikes.</p>\n<h3>Aerodynamics</h3>\n<p>For all Scott’s focus on increased utility, the brand says it makes sure the new Addict Gravel hasn’t forgotten its racy roots.</p>\n<p>Scott says it has deployed its patented airfoil profiles to the down tube, head tube, seat tube, seatpost and seatstays to smooth airflow without affecting comfort.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9851/scott-addict-gravel-bike-gallery#1\"><p><span>Image 2 of</span> 10</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/scottaddictgravel2_0.jpg?itok=LnBfakO4\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 2 of </span>10</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>What’s more, while making bikes that are stiff and light is the core tenet of Scott’s design philosophy, it says for the new Addict Gravel it was able to build in more attributes without undermining the bike’s stiffness and light weight thanks to ‘clever layering and reinforcement in certain zones’.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scott-sports.com/gb/en/products/bike-bikes-road-gravel-cx\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Check out the full Scott Addict Gravel range now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Consequently the frame is said to weigh 930g and the fork 395g on the top-tier ‘Tuned’ version of the design.</p>\n<h3>Addict Gravel range details</h3>\n<p>The ‘Tuned’ version of the frame sits at the top of the Addict Gravel family but there will be 10, 20 and 30 specs too which will meet different price points (price decreases as the denomination increases) as well as a ‘Contessa 15’ version.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9851/scott-addict-gravel-bike-gallery#9\"><p><span>Image 10 of</span> 10</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/scottaddictgravel10_0.jpg?itok=C_tTBTAk\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 10 of </span>10</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>Although the Contessa uses the same frame as the other bikes, this is a female-specific option featuring a different paint scheme and contact point components. All Addict Gravel bikes will be available to buy from September or October, Scott says.</p>\n<p>Scott’s gravel range will be completed by a Speedster Gravel line, available from August, which will trade carbon for an alloy frame material to access entry-level price points.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8632/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Tour de France 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9838/gallery-bikes-of-the-tour-de-france-2021\">Gallery: Bikes of the Tour de France 2021</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nFor exact specs and pricing of the Addict Gravel line, visit <a href=\"https://www.scott-sports.com/gb/en\" target=\"_blank\">scott-sports.com</a>, although note that Scott says costs are provisional and may be subject to change.</p>\n<p><em>Cyclist</em> is expecting a sample of the new bike to review soon, so <a href=\"/reviews\">be sure to check back</a> in a couple of months for our thoughts. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9851/scott-addict-gravel-bike-gallery\">Scott Addict Gravel bike gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/sam-challis\">Sam Challis</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>7 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9851%2Fscott-addict-gravel-bike-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Scott%20Addict%20Gravel%20bike%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9851%2Fscott-addict-gravel-bike-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Scott%20Addict%20Gravel%20bike%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9851%2Fscott-addict-gravel-bike-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Scott%20Addict%20Gravel%20bike%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9851%2Fscott-addict-gravel-bike-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9851/scott-addict-gravel-bike-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 10</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/scottaddictgravel1_0.jpg?itok=V9mb9SDk\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bikes\">Bikes</a></div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/cyclocross-gravel-and-adventure\">Cyclocross, gravel and adventure</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"schallis","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"59524344b83541bb3ae1b3bc2154cdce1499c61c61eb1057fb13ac224ebbae32","category":"Cycling"}
