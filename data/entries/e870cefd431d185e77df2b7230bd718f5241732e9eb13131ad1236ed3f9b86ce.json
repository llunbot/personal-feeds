He added that investors are more interested in whether the product announcement will convince customers that \"Apple's AR/MR headset device is the next star in consumer electronics,\" rather than shipment numbers. If the device does launch this year, shipments are likely to be even lower than existing estimates, he added.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMorgan Stanley analysts believe Apple's headset will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/02/apple-headset-october-production-report/\">enter mass production in October</a> and launch by December, just in time for the holiday period – a time frame that broadly mirrors Kuo's forecast. Apple's supply chain is apparently preparing to assemble only 300,000 to 500,000 headsets in 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's headset is widely expected to be announced today during its WWDC keynote, so there may soon be further information about when the device will launch.
