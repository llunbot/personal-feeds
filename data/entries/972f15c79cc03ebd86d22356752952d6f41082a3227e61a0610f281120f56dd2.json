Unfortunately for the electric automaker, it sold more than 1.8 million cars in 2023, beating this year's effort by 19,355 vehicles. But unlike last year, it sold more cars than it built, with production falling by 4 percent in 2024.</p>\n<p>In the final quarter of 2024, Tesla built 436,718 Models 3 and Y and delivered 471,930, clearing out a stash of inventory in the process. It built an additional 22,727 electric vehicles—the elderly Models S and X and the divisive Cybertruck—and sold 23,640 of them during the same three months. So in Q4 2024, Tesla actually achieved modest, year-over-year growth in total sales of about 2 percent.</p>\n<p>But the picture of the year as a whole is less rosy. Model 3 and Y sales fell by 2 percent year over year, with production falling by slightly more. As noted, this appears to have allowed Tesla to reduce what was at one point a growing inventory of unsold vehicles.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/tesla-sales-fell-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/tesla-sales-fell-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
