This was the 101st launch of an Atlas V rocket since its debut in 2002, and the 58th and final Atlas V mission with a US national security payload since 2007.</p>\n<p>The US Space Force's Space Systems Command confirmed a successful conclusion to the mission, code-named USSF-51, on Tuesday afternoon. The rocket's Centaur upper stage released the top secret USSF-51 payload about seven hours after liftoff, likely in a high-altitude geostationary orbit over the equator. The military did not publicize the exact specifications of the rocket's target orbit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039968#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039968&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f0dbffc5f86dfb7e5ade460d01da424cf2ee69643f00b79172b6163be86d073e","category":"Tech"}
