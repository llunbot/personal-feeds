For accidental damage, a deductible must be paid, but for manufacturing issues, Apple will cover repairs at no cost. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile ‌AppleCare‌+ is priced at $279/$399 for the new Macs, there are also renewable annual payments available at $150 for the 16-inch machine or $100 for the 14-inch machine, which will continue to be available until canceled. Apple also allows <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a> customers to pay ‌AppleCare‌+ fees in monthly installments. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has not provided details on what it will cost to repair a 14-inch or 16-inch MacBook Pro outside of the warranty period and with no ‌AppleCare‌+. ‌AppleCare‌+ can be purchased when buying a new MacBook Pro or within 60 days of receiving one of the new machines. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/20/apple-care-plus-macbook-pro/\">AppleCare+ for New 16-Inch MacBook Pro Costs $399</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/applecare-for-new-16-inch-macbook-pro-costs-399.2318341/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cfty5s_Ho1s:pWmFQWn9KTs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cfty5s_Ho1s:pWmFQWn9KTs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/cfty5s_Ho1s\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e4b6dd4a80d12f2423217105fc200dee487112772f17afb706412cd31e7cff17","category":"Apple"}
