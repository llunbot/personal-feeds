So here's a real poem instead, a six-part rhymed couplet romp in the playful spirit of Dr. Seuss or of Roald Dahl's <em>Revolting Rhymes</em>. It contains everything that literary critics say a good poem should: yak bile, yurts, Descartes, broken bones, lawyers, and an imagined Krogan romance. It brought me great joy to write such ridiculous rhymes, and I hope you experience at least a tiny fraction of that feeling as you read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of my recent experimentation with AI image generation, the images come from Microsoft's Bing Image Creator (which is powered by DALL-E). I think the drawings do a surprisingly good job of bringing some color to such a long string of words, even if—as so often happens with AI images—the fine details are a little odd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy!</p></em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/f84049ac-4a72-49d5-968c-e37b4037e87a.jpeg\" /></div>\n<p>In 2007, when phones began changing,<br />\nMy mother engaged in some life rearranging.<br />\nA client of hers used some \"herbal\" pomade,<br />\nThen he itched and he burned and he swore and he swayed.<br />\nHis hair all fell out and it hurt when he sat,<br />\nHe was owed, he complained, compensation for that.<br />\nMy mother agreed, and it came out at trial:<br />\nThe \"herb\" in the cream was your basic yak bile,<br />\nWell known for its harm to follicular lining<br />\nBut cheap when you needed to keep male hair shining.<br />\nSo mom won her case 'gainst the maker of hair gel,<br />\nAnd got a promotion and started to buy. Well—<br />\nShe bought a red car, a blue dress, and a Shih Tzu<br />\nWith money that being made <em>partner</em> will get you.<br />\nShe purchased a lake house, a boat, and two skis,<br />\nBooked space on a flight known for pulling 6 Gs,<br />\nShe joined Junior League and a gym called \"The FitZone\"<br />\nBut bigger change came when she snapped up that iPhone.</p>\n<div><img

rectangular slab of her dreams,<br />\nShe saw in his spiel the last item she needed,<br />\nto keep her life's lawn well-cut, watered, and weeded,<br />\nThe one thing she lacked that would make her complete:<br />\nA phone that would mark her among the elite.<br />\nShe used it for voice calls, text messages, maps,<br />\nAnd—when Jobs allowed it—then even for apps.<br />\nAt first she took pleasure in whipping it out,<br />\nBut soon she had questions; later came doubt.<br />\nMoving through life needed motion and sass,<br />\nBut here she was now, just swiping on glass.<br />\nOn subways, in cars, while at church, in the bar,<br />\nShe stuck to that phone like one mired in tar,<br />\nUnable to extricate finger or eye,<br />\nCaught like a mammoth just waiting to die.<br />\nThe things in her life that were golden and green<br />\nSoon looked beige and boring set next to that screen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><img

longer than notes,<br />\nThat went in my lunchbox or in my mom's purse;<br />\nWhen we left the house, he just stayed in and cursed.<br />\nWriter's block had long blocked him from living his genius,<br />\nA bona fide, certified, true act of meanness<br />\nDoled out by a cosmos so fickle and foul<br />\nThat it blessed dad with bricks but provided no trowel.<br />\nHe cooked all our meals, cleaned our clothes, skimmed our pool<br />\nWore green sneakers, red glasses, and had a strict rule<br />\nAgainst washing his jeans—said it messed with the denim—<br />\nBut under the cool lay a thin streak of venom.<br />\nSo mom went to work and she brought home the bacon,<br />\nWhile dad stayed inside on a long-term vacation.<br />\nA self-proclaimed \"genius\" who’s blocked might start drinking,<br />\nWhen hopes and raw talent both feel like they're sinking<br />\nBut rather than going the Hemingway route,<br />\nDad scooped up the bottles and threw them all out.<br />\nHe holed up instead in the den with a TV,<br />\nA seventy-five inch reflective monstrosity,<br />\nLoudly proclaiming to any who'd listen<br />\nThat prestige TV's \"golden age\" had arisen.<br />\nHe hatched a keen plan to watch every minute<br />\nOf every long series with \"real actors\" in it.<br />\nForget those new novels, forget those old poems,<br />\nAnd don't even mention the biblical tomes.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/644f035a-93ca-49d1-afdf-0e093c826356-1.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>Hollywood offered the realest life lessons:<br />\nThe Ts and the As and the Smiths and the Wessons;<br />\nHearts on parade; life's jocularity;<br />\ndrugs sold in Baltimore; peace, love, and charity.<br />\nBut—<br />\nWhenever I happened to peek in the door<br />\nHe seemed to be lying asleep on the floor,<br />\nReality shows were binge-blasting above him,<br />\nGreat British bakers with great British muffins.<br />\nThe \"truth\" TV showed him was older than dirt:<br />\nSpend your life lying down and your soul starts to hurt.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><img

out-shined any screen.<br />\nI read and I built and I played—then repeated,<br />\nWhile they binge-watched <i>Frasier</i> or read what they’d tweeted.<br />\nBut one bright blue day, I could take it no more,<br />\nA dim indoor life was both safe and a bore.<br />\nSo I put down my book and I rose from the couch,<br />\nWent outside, climbed a tree, slipped right down and screamed “ouch,”<br />\nSince I broke half the bones in my left and right feet<br />\nAnd for weeks couldn’t walk, though I could learn to beat<br />\nA huge backlog of games for my sweet new PlayStation,<br />\nBrought up to my room by a dark delegation:<br />\nTwo guilty-eyed parents, both clearly aware<br />\nThe outdoors wasn’t “great,” no one needed “fresh air,”<br />\nAnd “go out and play” was a scam by some nurses<br />\nWho’d push us outside... and then right into hearses.<br />\nWe were safer at home, in the bedroom or basement,<br />\nEnthralled with a screen—the best cheap risk abatement.<br />\nMy parents retreated, their offering made<br />\nAnd I stayed in bed, where I slept and I played.</p>\n<div><img

same socks<br />\nFor five days in a row while I wandered the West<br />\nWhere I gambled, shot, looted as one of the best<br />\nOf the worst men on earth, who would take all your cash<br />\nAnd then rustle your horses—until a game crash<br />\nCorrupted each one of my character saves<br />\nAnd my undying bandit now rests in his grave.<br />\nI role-played my way through space outpost and ocean,<br />\nKissed girls, then a guy, then two alien Krogan<br />\nAnd after I saved Ancient Greece, modern Gotham,<br />\nThe Milky Way, Earth, and a meadow in blossom<br />\nI jumped into war games and called down some woe<br />\nUpon trench-coated Nazis, last hateable foe.<br />\nThen I found out, when my six weeks were through,<br />\nAnd the casts were sawed off and my feet felt like new,<br />\nThat the “real world” was scary and not as much fun<br />\nAs a good online game, tight controls, and a gun.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><img

want to remember.<br />\nMy dad had become the first human to view<br />\nEach glorious show in his long Netflix queue.<br />\nA powerful sense of despair then descended<br />\nAs he pondered paths in which his life had tended.<br />\nWithout the TV, he had no good distraction<br />\nFrom thinking and thinking about his inaction.<br />\nAnd mom gained a habit of checking her phone<br />\nAt inopportune times—not just when alone.<br />\nOnce in the courtroom, she gave a small snort<br />\nAfter reading a joke text on spousal support.<br />\nThe judge made her stand and then read her a lecture,<br />\nSuggesting that maybe her friends shouldn’t text her<br />\nWhile she was in court or there’d be an attempt<br />\nTo blackball my mom and find her in contempt.</p>\n<div><img

and came down with eye twitches<br />\nWhich didn’t concern me until Christmas came—<br />\nAnd I spent it upstairs with a video game.<br />\nSomething wasn’t quite right—life was losing its savor<br />\nThat hard-to-define-it-but-you’ll-know-it flavor.<br />\nAll three of us sat on our beds or on chairs<br />\nFeeling much too depressed to go up or down stairs.<br />\nIn the New Year, my mom called a Zoom meeting<br />\nAnd we all said yes, that we should start treating<br />\nOur addictive and yet unacknowledged submission—<br />\nAnd start seeing screens with a lot more suspicion.<br />\nSo this would be it: our year of detoxing.<br />\nWe took all our screens and spent Sunday night boxing<br />\nThem up and then down to the basement we went;<br />\nWe were going to be free—one hundred per cent.<br />\n“We’ll rethink it all,” my dad said, “Like Descartes!<br />\nAnd rebuild our lives from the floor to rampart.”<br />\nThen came the fidgets, the phantom limb feeling<br />\nThat some part of you was cut off and not healing,<br />\nThat reflex of reaching for phone or controller<br />\nAnd finding your hand felt a little bit colder<br />\nWith nothing to cradle, no glorious gizmos<br />\nThat promise to stop you from thinking of escrows,<br />\nOf egos, of toads beneath harrows, of death<br />\nThat still stalks us with rattling breath…<br />\nWell—<br />\nWe tried what we could, we ate family dinners<br />\nAnd read books on how to think just like real winners,<br />\nBooks written by not-yet-disgraced CEOs<br />\nAnd relationship gurus who maintained their pose<br />\nThat life had a code, and they had it figured;<br />\nEverything came down to slogans and zingers.<br />\n“Self-love is not selfish,” my mother would say,<br />\nWalking past with her yoga mat. “So—Namaste!”<br />\nMy dad ditched his flannels for logoed T-shirts<br />\nThat said things like “Good Vibes” and “Selfishness Hurts.”<br />\nBut I couldn’t quit the allure of distraction—<br />\nDid we have to kill <i>all</i> of that sweet screen time action?<br />\nCould ten minutes matter—heck, round up to an hour—<br />\nWith that glowing blue screen of unusual power?<br />\nSo on Easter Sunday, screens still in the basement,<br />\nI crept out at night from my hidden emplacement<br />\nYearning to feel that now long-lost connection,<br />\nLooking to have a device resurrection.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/449fbb98-cd98-4761-b2c2-2f03fbbceb7c-1.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>I tip-toed downstairs, where I flipped on the switch<br />\nAnd startled my dad, who said, “Son of a bitch!”<br />\nBecause there were my parents, on a ratty old loveseat<br />\nWith gadgets plugged in and a cheese plate to eat.<br />\nThey sat side-by-side, I saw with a shock,<br />\nshe texting away while he watched <i>The Rock.</i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><img

New York—and a yurt.<br />\nThe Shambala Center would unchain our brains<br />\nThrough mindfulness, yoga, and chanted refrains.<br />\n(And some really remarkably boring-ass food;<br />\nBrown rice will sustain you but won’t lift your mood.)<br />\nIt was Buddhist by way of San Fran and Cape Cod;<br />\nBig dollops of Burning Man, self-help, and God.</p>\n<div><img

the cold for two hours.<br />\nWe warmed up by milking five cows and six goats,<br />\nThen shoveling muesli bars into our throats.<br />\nMeditation time followed, from nine until ten,<br />\nAt which point we down-dogged—then got Zenned again.<br />\nWe lived in each moment, just present and grounded<br />\nContent without screens until mealtime bells sounded.<br />\nPost-lunch you could meet with a life coach of sorts<br />\nWho wore sandals and socks and some shocking short shorts<br />\nShe held herself out as a spiritual leader,<br />\nA wonderfully wise counselor and soul reader.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/6732aac3-eb12-420b-a0cc-c5676d03f953-1.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>Mom, dad, and I got the same strong advice:<br />\n“Treat your cell phones like vermin; treat them like lice!<br />\nShampoo them and tweeze them right out of your life,<br />\nAnd if that doesn’t work—go ahead, grab a knife!<br />\nCut them and stab them until they’re all dead;<br />\nNo gadgets should come anywhere near your head.”<br />\nThis felt extreme, but she was persuasive;<br />\n“Doing without” came to seem innovative.<br />\nBut she closed each session with one final koan:<br />\n“Bury your fears before ditching your phone.”<br />\nFeeling better and kinder and somewhat more mellow.<br />\nWithout all those gadgets to thunder and bellow<br />\nTheir notifications, their beeps and their boops,<br />\nOur brains settled down and stopped spinning in loops.<br />\nBut three weeks in tents being mindful as balls<br />\nMade us realize how much we loved houses and walls.<br />\nBack home we headed, not “cured” and not “better,”<br />\nBut willing to hack at our digital fetter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><img

Rings</i> and the whole MCU,<br />\nAnd instead moved his TV right out of the den,<br />\nThen stopped, picked it up, put it back in again.<br />\n“I don’t need an office,” he said, “and the desk?<br />\nYou can forget it—just so Kafkaesque.<br />\nMy new way of writing is outdoors and rambling.<br />\nTreat life like a slot machine and then get to gambling<br />\nThat words won by walking will mean something special—<br />\nReal and alive, not just self-referential.”<br />\nNo more skinny jeans, no more sweatshirts with hoods.<br />\nIn khakis and boots, Dad went tramping through woods.<br />\nHe got poison ivy his second week out,<br />\nBut wasn’t distracted by even this bout<br />\nOf bad fortune, nor by the deep itching<br />\nFrom gnats that in week four invaded his stitching.<br />\nHe owned a hard truth that was clear to us all:<br />\nDad wasn’t a Jesus nor even Saint Paul.<br />\nHe was (at the most) a quite minor apostle<br />\nMaking his way through the throng and the jostle<br />\nOf life with good grace and a few observations<br />\nJotted while fleeing those indoor temptations.<br />\nHe bowed to his failures as though to a teacher,<br />\nWhich unblocked the words, even when they were weaker<br />\nThan he might have wanted—than he might have yearned for—<br />\nAnd yet he was working and up off the floor.</p>\n<div><img

microbiome.<br />\nShe downed probiotics but felt like a jerk<br />\nWhen repeating her mantra: “I’m <i>good</i> at my work!”<br />\nBut as she grew comfortable with her own worth<br />\nShe gradually felt like her one shot on earth<br />\nWas wasted on suing the modestly vile—<br />\nLike those who made cash selling rare black yak bile.<br />\nYes, bile was bad but not quite as soul killing<br />\nAs finding yourself socialized into willing<br />\nThat you could spend <i>more</i> of your life’s precious powers<br />\nContractually parsing for billable hours.<br />\nWho needed a Bentley or rides on a jet<br />\nWhen all that one wanted—all one could get—<br />\nIn an ultimate sense was some love and affection<br />\n(And a quite passable strappy sandal collection.)<br />\nBut when she had shared this enlightened perspective<br />\nWith her fellow partners, she got a corrective<br />\nTo her big idea that less work wasn’t lazy.<br />\nThe partners just looked at her like she was crazy,<br />\nA “typical woman” who valued her kid<br />\nMore than flying first class on Spring Break to Madrid.<br />\nSo Mom quit. She walked out. She began something new,<br />\nA firm where the goal was not just to accrue<br />\nBut to <i>live</i>. Sure, money was less by a factor of two,<br />\nYet so was the time—“And you can’t beat the view<br />\nFrom your own corner office,” she said with a smile,<br />\n“Even when it looks out on the city trash pile.”<br />\nHaving worked on herself and then taken real action<br />\nMom now needed less of that online distraction.<br />\nShe used her phone daily but once through our door,<br />\nThe glowing rectangle went into a drawer.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bc38cbb9-3787-4b3b-b72e-b1fee3f07a73-1.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>As for me, I could spin out a credible story<br />\nAbout how I came to stop playing those gory<br />\nAnd glorious shooters I loved to lose days in,<br />\nBut that would not be a true-hearted confession.<br />\nGames are amazing! You can’t just say no<br />\nTo a drug that’s so potent, it lets you go pro<br />\nAnd play e-sports tourneys for serious bank<br />\nBy attacking with Ryu or driving a tank.<br />\nSo I couldn’t stop gaming—perhaps I had failed,<br />\nBut my custom controller just couldn’t be jailed.<br />\nYet I did venture out with my mom and my dad<br />\nOn short winter walks that were quiet and sad<br />\nAnd long summer rambles that filled me joy<br />\nIn green growing things and the ways they destroy<br />\nThat terminal sense of a distance from life,<br />\nOur love of distraction, “the news,” and of strife<br />\nAnd offer instead a rest from algorithms,<br />\nNot free from our problems—but slowed to life’s rhythms.<br />\nAnd though I kept thinking of games in 3D,<br />\nI ignored all my fears and then free-climbed a tree.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/d3698606-55d9-463d-9a13-33c28486e74b-1.jpg\" /></div>\n<p>So that’s the whole story, with jolts and collapses<br />\nAnd more than a few temporary relapses,<br />\nOf how screens invaded, like all colonizers,<br />\nDismissing our cultures, proclaiming theirs wiser.<br />\nAnd much of it <i>was</i> unbelievably awesome<br />\nBut some was just petty, and parts were just dumb.<br />\nAmazing the way screens could melt down like wax<br />\nAnd fill in our minds’ and our hearts’ biggest cracks,<br />\nTo keep us engaged with the unending new<br />\nWhile ignoring the quiet, the boring, the true.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7912e23f-c93a-499b-9d04-5ed3487bd5e2-1-300x296.jpg\" /></div>\n</div>\n\n</div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928084\">Read on Ars Technica</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928084&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5d93be30c760fb7feea01778b588c1b0f9d56913d631b65fd38f6dcf47f75a0b","category":"Tech"}
