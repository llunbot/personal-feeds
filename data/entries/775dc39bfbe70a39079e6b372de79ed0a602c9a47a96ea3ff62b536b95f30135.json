Following today's announcement of a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/apple-announces-new-ipad-air-with-m3-chip/\">new iPad Air with an M3 chip</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman now says that Apple plans to announce the long-rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/m4-macbook-air-what-to-expect/\">MacBook Air with the M4 chip</a> tomorrow.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/cook-tweet-air-upscale.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"810\" />\r<br />\n\"Expect the M4 MacBook Air tomorrow as part of the new product wave,\" he said, <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1896952051386769851\">in a post on X</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman initially said the new MacBook Air <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/23/macbook-air-with-m4-chip-launch-timing/\">would be announced \"earlier\" than the iPhone 16e and new iPad Air</a>, but that information was evidently wrong.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs was the case with the new iPad Air, and the iPhone 16e last month, the new MacBook Air should be announced in a press release on the Apple Newsroom website.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeyond the M4 chip, the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models are expected to have Thunderbolt 4 ports, a Center Stage camera, longer battery life, and a few other minor upgrades. No design changes are expected.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/new-macbook-air-tomorrow-says-gurman/\">Apple Expected to Announce New MacBook Air 'Tomorrow'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expected-to-announce-new-macbook-air-tomorrow.2451330/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"775dc39bfbe70a39079e6b372de79ed0a602c9a47a96ea3ff62b536b95f30135","category":"Apple"}
