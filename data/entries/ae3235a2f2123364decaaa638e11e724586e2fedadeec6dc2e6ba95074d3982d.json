{"title":"Ars Technica on Intel’s New Alder Lake CPUs","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/intels-alder-lake-big-little-cpu-design-tested-its-a-barn-burner/","date":1636139299000,"content":"\n<p>Jim Salter, writing for Ars Technica:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the AMD fans in the crowd are looking for something to crow\nabout, this is it — both raw power draw and performance-per-watt\nfor Intel are still much worse than on competing AMD designs. The\nhigher core count in Alder Lake translates to a higher power draw\nas well — nearly back up to Intel 10th-generation levels, and\nwell north of either the Ryzen 9 5900X or 5950X.</p>\n\n<p>We saw more than a 300W system power draw at the wall for the\ni9-12900K — that’s over 100 watts higher than our Ryzen 9 5950X\nat full tilt. About 230W of that draw is accounted for by the\ni9-12900K’s CPU package itself, as reported by its own sensors to\n<a href=\"https://www.hwinfo.com/download/\">hwinfo64</a>. Power efficiency is a somewhat different story:\nalthough the i9-12900K guzzles more power than the i9-11900K did,\nit offers stunningly higher performance — about a 50 percent net\ngain. (Though it’s still nearly as far behind the Ryzen 9 5950X as\nit is ahead of its own older sibling, unfortunately.)</p>\n\n<p>The lack of overall efficiency here is somewhat surprising given\nAlder Lake’s hybrid big.little design, which we expected would\ngive it an edge over AMD’s traditional all-performance-core setup.\nWe suspect the culprit is Intel’s 10nm process — the company\nclaims that it’s basically similar in density to the 7nm TSMC\nprocess Zen 3 enjoys, but <em>something</em> has to account for the\ndiscrepancy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Intel is seemingly only capable of operating at the extremes: very fast “performance at all costs” chips that consume inordinate power, and power-efficient chips that run <em>very</em> slow. The sweet spot is clearly a proper balance in the middle.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/05/ars-technica-intel-alder-lake\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ae3235a2f2123364decaaa638e11e724586e2fedadeec6dc2e6ba95074d3982d","category":"Tech"}
