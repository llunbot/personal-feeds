The playlists include extended, instrumental, and reimagined versions of popular tracks from artists such as Imagine Dragons, Katy Perry, Kacey Musgraves, and others.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe playlists were crafted by a team of producers, scientists, and audio engineers at Sollos, a music-wellness venture within Universal Music Group.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's announcement explains further:<blockquote>Songs have been enhanced with auditory beats or colored noise to help encourage specific brain responses. Gamma waves and white noise — a whoosh-like combination of every sound frequency — may help with focusing; theta waves could aid in relaxation; and delta waves and pink noise — a deeper, gentler variation akin to rain or wind — might assist in achieving better sleep. A dreamy version of Katy Perry's \"Double Rainbow,\" for example, could help listeners drift off to sleep, while an Imagine Dragons track might help them tackle a to-do list.</blockquote>The playlists are powered by Universal's proprietary audio technologies, and they are backed by scientific research, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\"Sound Therapy harnesses the power of sound waves, psychoacoustics, and cognitive science to help listeners relax or focus the mind,\" says Apple's announcement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSound Therapy is available exclusively on Apple Music.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/13/apple-music-sound-therapy/\">Apple and Universal Music Announce 'Sound Therapy'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-and-universal-music-announce-sound-therapy.2457005/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"43fcd4671519152efe10891eb7de02df58ad32944c121e82085fb9ac69cf271c","category":"Apple"}
