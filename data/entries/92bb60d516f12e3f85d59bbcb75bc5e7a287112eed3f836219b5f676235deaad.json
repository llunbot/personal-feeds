The credentials make it easy for the underlying program to access databases or cloud services necessary for it to work as intended. I published one such PSA in 2013 after discovering simple searches that turned up dozens of accounts that appeared to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/01/psa-dont-upload-your-important-passwords-to-github/\">expose credentials</a> securing computer-to-server SSH accounts. One of the credentials appeared to grant access to an account on Chromium.org, the repository that stores the source code for Google's open source browser.</p>\n<p>In 2015, Uber learned the hard way just how damaging the practice can be. One or more developers for the ride service had embedded a unique security key into code and then shared that code on a public GitHub page. Hackers then copied the key and used it to access an internal Uber database and, from there, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/03/in-major-goof-uber-stored-sensitive-database-key-on-public-github-page/\">steal sensitive data</a> belonging to 50,000 Uber drivers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984368#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984368&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"92bb60d516f12e3f85d59bbcb75bc5e7a287112eed3f836219b5f676235deaad","category":"Tech"}
