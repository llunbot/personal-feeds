What some users might not know is that you can also make a Live Photo bounce back and forth like a boomerang.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/icloud-photos.jpg\" width=\"836\" height=\"470\" />\r<br />\nIf you're familiar with Instagram, you probably know what a boomerang is. Since introducing ‌Live Photos‌ in 2015, Apple has added some effects to its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app that let you turn them into fun animated clips, and the Bounce effect is basically the same thing as a boomerang. It rewinds the action backward and forward. Here's how to make one of your own on ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n<ol><li>Open the ‌Photos‌ app and select a Live Photo. (If you look under \"Media Types\" in the <strong>Albums</strong> section, you'll find all of your ‌Live Photos‌ collated in a folder of the same name.)</li>\r<br />\n<li>With the Live Photo open, tap the <strong>LIVE</strong> icon in the top-left corner of the interface.</li>\r<br />\n<li>From the dropdown menu that appears, choose <strong>Bounce</strong>.</li></ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/boomerang-live-photos-1.jpg\" alt=\"Live Photos\" width=\"2898\" height=\"2796\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe effect you choose will be applied immediately, ready for you to share it using the Share icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Note that there are two other effects that you can try in ‌Photos‌: Loop repeats the action in a continuous looping video, and Long Exposure simulates a DSLR-like long exposure effect by blurring motion.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDid you know that it you get a blurry Live Photo image, you can open it up and see if other frames you captured are clearer, and then <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/make-a-new-key-photo-in-live-photos/\">select a replacement \"key photo\" for it</a>.
