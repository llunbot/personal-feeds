Unveiling a new concept car — the details of which are\nstill under embargo until December 3 — Jaguar’s passionate team\nspoke for most of the day about how they plan to ‘delete ordinary’\nand ‘live vivid’. Whatever that means…</p>\n\n<p>In what, at times, felt like a drunken dream, Jaguar personnel\nwalked journalists through its plans to ‘reimagine’ the much-loved\nbrand over the next few years. Calling it a ‘complete reset’,\nMcGovern at one point told journalists that his team had ‘not been\nsniffing the white stuff — this is real’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation: they’ve all been sniffing a metric ton of the white stuff. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300569/jaguar-rebrand-new-logo-ev\">This looks like the identity for a women’s razor brand</a> or something.
