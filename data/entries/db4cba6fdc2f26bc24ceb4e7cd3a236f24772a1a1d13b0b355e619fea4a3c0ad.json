There’s a fair selection in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670670/which-ipad-best.html\">current Apple catalog</a>, from the diminutive iPad mini all the way up to the incredibly powerful (not to mention very expensive) iPad Pro. It can be intimidating, especially as different users have different needs. To help you make sense of it all, here’s our guide to finding the best iPad for seniors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What makes an iPad good for older users?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>iPad owners don’t magically transform into timid technophobes on their 70th birthdays, and there isn’t one right answer to this question. Any iPad model might turn out to be the right choice for a specific older user, depending on that user’s precise requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are a few criteria that <em>tend</em> to become more of a factor when our bodies begin to age. Screen size is one element, with eyes not being as strong as they once were. Weight/portability can also become more important; some older users have arthritis, while others find they tire more easily than they used to when using a tablet for extended periods of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will also want to think carefully about price vs power and features, since you don’t want to spend lots of money on a device with capabilities you’ll never really use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, as we say, these can be true for any user, so it’s always best to talk to the person in question about their particular needs if you want to pick the perfect tablet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were to put us on the spot, however, we do have some thoughts about the iPads that are most likely to suit an older user. Here’s our selection.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest affordable option: iPad (2021, 9th generation)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" alt=\"Best affordable option: iPad (2021, 9th generation)\" src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/features/3814074/apple_ipad_2021_review_9.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tAffordable\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tA13 Bionic processor\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSupport for Apple Pencil (1st Gen)\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSolid performance\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tHome button\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tOlder design\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t64GB storage is quite low\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$329 (base model)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray-9th-Generation/483978365&amp;subid1=1-1-678457-6-357716-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$249 at  Walmart</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9FPHY6?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$328.99 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmk2k3lla.html&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-678457-6-357716-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$329 at  Adorama</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668152/ipad-10-2in-2021-9th-generation-review.html\">10.2in iPad (2021)</a> may well be the cheapest iPad model you can buy, but that doesn’t mean it’s a truly ‘budget’ device in the pejorative sense. For many – perhaps most – people, this iPad will deliver everything you want from a tablet and not cost you a small fortune in the process.</p>\n\n<p>When Apple launched the 10th Generation iPad in October 2022 it continued to sell the 9th Generation model, which still has plenty to offer and could well be the best blend of affordability, power and functionality for the older user. One of the reasons we say this is the inclusion of the Home button. iPadOS features many great swipe gestures for navigating through apps and menus, but sometimes it’s good to have a simple button that can always take you back to the Home screen. It stops you from feeling lost or confused when you just want to open up a new app or change some settings. As the last iPad to come with a Home button, this is a prime feature to consider when it comes to selecting an iPad for senior users. A good rule of thumb is the phone they currently use. If it’s an older iPhone with a Home button, then this iPad will be instantly familiar to them, but if it’s anything from the iPhone X onwards, then you may want to opt for some of the other options listed below. </p>\n\n<p>Apple’s A13 Bionic chip powers the iPad (9th Gen), and it’s ideal for surfing the web, watching streaming services and shopping online. This is the same processor that also featured in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667961/iphone-11-pro-review-2.html\">iPhone 11, Pro and Pro Max</a> when they launched in 2019, so it’s a bit old, but it’s a chip that should be supported by Apple for a few more years. </p>\n\n<p>For FaceTime calls there’s a 12MP Ultra Wide front camera which offers advanced features such as Centre Stage (which allows you to move around on video calls while the iPad tracks you – so you don’t disappear out of view), 2x zoom and 1080p video.</p>\n\n<p>Why are these features particularly good for seniors? Well, having an excellent video-call experience will allow them to keep in touch with the grandkids, friends or family around the world, without looking grainy or like they’re calling from the early 2000s.</p>\n\n<p>The 10.2-inch display is also large enough for eyes that might be starting to diminish in power, while the touch targets on the screen will be easy to hit with unsteady hands. Of course, many seniors are full of more life and vigor than their grandchildren, and the ability to connect an Apple Smart keyboard and first-gen Apple Pencil makes this a perfect companion for traveling while writing memoirs or creating art. It’s also the only remaining iPad to feature a headphone jack, which could be very useful if the intended recipient hasn’t yet embraced the wireless charms of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/549094/airpods-3rd-generation-review.html\">AirPods</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233522/airpods-pro-review.html\">AirPod Pros</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The 9th-gen iPad comes in these storage options, priced as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>64GB: £329/$369</li>\n\n<li>256GB: £479/$549</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to add cellular capabilities then those are also available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>64GB (cellular): £459/$519</li>\n\n<li>256GB (cellular): £609/$699</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It isn’t just the best choice for older users, but probably for most users full stop.</p>\n\n<p>Apple is likely to update the iPad in 2024, and when it does so it is likely to drop the 9th generation iPad from the lineup, so this may be your last chance to buy an iPad with a Home button if that is what you want! </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/556861/ipad-9th-generation-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iPad (9th gen, A13, 2021) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest lightweight option – iPad mini (2021)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Best lightweight option - iPad mini (2021)\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3810116/apple_ipad_mini_2021_review_12.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLightweight\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tModern design\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tA15 Bionic processor\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSmaller screen size\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tHigher price than former iPad minis\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t64GB storage on base-line model\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$499 (64GB) | $649 (256GB)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G983JJS?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$399.99 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-64gb-2021-6th-generation-starlight%2F-%2FA-77615842&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-678457-6-664584-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$499.99 at  Target </a><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi-Cellular-64GB-Starlight-6th-Generation/406091219&amp;subid1=1-1-678457-6-664584-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$629 at  Walmart</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>It’s a sad fact that as we age our bodies can lose some of their strength or gain some conditions that we avoided when younger. If you’re looking for an iPad that’s lightweight, and therefore easier to hold for longer periods, then the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668142/ipad-mini-6-2021-review.html\">iPad mini (2021)</a> is the one to choose. At around 0.65lbs/293g it’s roughly half the weight of the 9th gen iPad discussed above.</p>\n\n<p>This is made possible, as the name suggests, by the smaller display. But the 8.3-inch panel is still an excellent size for the web, not to mention actually better as an e-reader thanks to being easier to hold.</p>\n\n<p>Under the hood, the iPad mini is a powerhouse, with an A15 Bionic chip (as seen in the iPhone 13), 5G capabilities on the LTE models, plenty of storage, and powerful cameras with the same Ultra Wide front-facing module as on the 9th-gen iPad. It’s compatible with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667842/apple-pencil-2018-review.html\">Apple Pencil (2nd gen)</a> and various <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668400/best-ipad-keyboard.html\">Bluetooth keyboards</a>, so you can use it as a small laptop if you want to get stuff done.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a lovely package that offers the most portable solution for those who want to take their iPad with them.</p>\n\n<p>The iPad mini (2021) is available in these configurations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>iPad mini (2021, Wi-Fi) 64GB: $499/£569</li>\n\n<li>iPad mini (2021, Wi-Fi) 256GB: $649/£749</li>\n\n<li>iPad mini (2021, Wi-Fi + Cellular) 64GB: $649/£749</li>\n\n<li>iPad mini (2021, Wi-Fi + Cellular) 256GB: $799/£929</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677718/best-ipad-mini-deals-cheapest-price-for-ipad-mini-6th-generation.html\">best iPad mini deals</a> to see if you can get one for a lower price. </p>\n\n<p>Apple is likely to update the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">iPad mini in 2024</a>, and when it does a new processor is likely, but we don’t anticipate many other changes. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668134/ipad-mini-2021-vs-ipad-2021.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iPad mini (6th gen, A15, 2021) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest all-rounder – iPad (2022, 10th generation)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" alt=\"Best all-rounder - iPad (2022, 10th generation)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ipad-10th-gen-colors.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tModern design\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLandscape camera\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tVarious colours\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tUSB-C port\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tHigher price than previous generations\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t64GB of storage on base model\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tOnly supports Apple Pencil (1st Gen)\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $449\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-678457-6-1357549-9934&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad\" target=\"_blank\">$449 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The newest device on this list is the 10th generation iPad, which arrived in October 2022 without the Home button design of its forebears and follows the aesthetic established by iPad mini and iPad Air. Although the Home button is gone, this iPad still features Touch ID, it’s just that the sensor is now part of the power button that resides on the top edge of the device. This allows Apple to fit a large 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display into a chassis that’s almost the same size as the 9th generation iPad, which has a 10.2-inch screen. Obviously, this increased screen real estate will be attractive to those who prefer larger fonts and should make tapping on-screen buttons a little easier for unsteady hands. </p>\n\n<p>One of the main new features, aside from the overall design, is that Apple has finally moved the front-facing camera from the traditional top bezel to the longer side one. This essentially turns it from portrait to landscape, hence the name Landscape Ultra Wide camera. The upside of this is that you can sit the iPad on its longer side when making FaceTime calls, which will have you looking into the middle of the camera rather than it being off to the side. There’s also support for Centre-Stage, so if you move around, the software will keep you in the centre of the shot. Basically, this makes it the best iPad for FaceTime calls with family.  </p>\n\n<p>The included A14 Bionic chip, that previously powered the iPhone 12 range (including the Pro models), means there’s plenty of performance available for most. You can use the 1st generation Apple Pencil on this device, and the new USB-C port opens up a world of peripherals you can plug into the iPad. These include keyboards, external storage and even monitors if you want a pseudo-desktop PC. </p>\n\n<p>One drawback of this switch is that owners of a 1st generation Apple Pencil will need to buy an adaptor to be able to charge it from the iPad. If you buy a new Pencil from Apple, the adapter is now included in the box. </p>\n\n<p>The iPad comes in four attractive colors (Blue, Pink, Yellow and Silver).</p>\n\n<p>These are the available configurations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>64GB: $449/£499</li>\n\n<li>256GB: $599/£679</li>\n\n<li>64GB (Cellular): $599/£679</li>\n\n<li>256GB (Cellular): $749/£859</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As with the other iPads on this list, you might want to consider opting for the 256GB storage variant, as 64GB can fill up pretty quickly if you like to store photos and videos on the device itself. Apple also offers a new keyboard case called the Magic Keyboard Folio, which is nice but costs an eye-watering $249/£279, so we’d advise looking for cheaper (and often just as good) third-party products instead.

Also, they come with Pro-level prices, which isn’t great if you’re only going to use them to watch iPlayer and FaceTime the grandkids. So, for the more discerning user that requires plenty of power but at a reasonable price, the iPad Air is an excellent solution. </p>\n\n<p>With the introduction of the 10th generation iPad 10.9-inch, there’s not much to differentiate that model and this one. But, when you look closely, you can see from where the extra expense comes. The two devices are around the same size, although the Air is marginally more compact and lightweight. Both sport a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display, but the one on the Air is fully-laminated, so there’s no air-gap between the glass and digitizer, which makes it feel like you’re touching the actual pixels and makes using the compatible Apple Pencil (2nd gen) that much smoother.  </p>\n\n<p>They feature the same 12Mp cameras on the back and front, only the 10th gen iPad one is located on the longer side of the device, making it landscape. But, under the hood the Air has the incredibly powerful M1 processor, which was previously found in the last generation of iPad Pros, not to mention several recent Macs. This takes things to another level. If someone wants to play games, use graphically intensive apps or just wants a really fast user experience, then the M1 delivers that in spades. </p>\n\n<p>The iPad Air (2022) has often be called the iPad Pro for normal people, and that’s exactly what it is. The USB-C port allows you to connect various external devices, such as storage or monitors, so it can easily transform into an laptop with a processor that’s desktop-class. Apple offers the sleek Magic Keyboard folio case, but at $299/£319 it’s way overpriced, so we’d suggest a third-party Bluetooth keyboard and case as a more frugal option.</p>\n\n<p>The only real downside, apart from a price hike by Apple for non-US customers, is the 64GB of storage available on the base model. This seems very mean-spirited of Apple, especially when its iPhones usually start at 128GB. With that in mind, you’ll probably want to go for the more expensive 256GB configuration as it will age a bit better.  </p>\n\n<p>You can pick up the iPad Air in the following configurations: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>iPad Air (2022, Wi-Fi) 64GB: $599/£669</li>\n\n<li>iPad Air (2022, Wi-Fi) 256GB: $749/£849</li>\n\n<li>iPad Air (2022, Wi-Fi + Cellular) 64GB: $749/£849</li>\n\n<li>iPad Air (2022, Wi-Fi + Cellular) 256GB: $899/£1,029</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The iPad Air is likely to be updated in 2024, read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/new-ipad-air-all-the-rumors-about-apples-6th-gen-ipad-air.html\">2024 iPad Air rumors</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Also read our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675139/best-ipad-air-deals.html\">best iPad Air deals</a> too, so you don’t miss out on any great offers. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668204/ipad-air-2022-vs-ipad-air-2020.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iPad Air (5th gen, M1, 2022) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest luxury option – iPad Pro (2022)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" alt=\"Best luxury option - iPad Pro (2022)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/11-inch-ipad-pro-2022.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tInsanely powerful\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tBest iPads money can buy\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tProMotion displays\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tVery expensive\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tToo much power for most people\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t12.9-inch model is heavy\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$799 (128GB, Wi-Fi only)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLF3RR3?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$783.94 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/473657/7613?prodsku=MNXD3LL%2FA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fgo%2Fproduct%2FMNXD3&amp;intsrc=CATF_3652&amp;subid1=1-1-678457-6-1356635-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$799.00 at  Apple</a><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=5498400&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F5498400%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-678457-6-1356635-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$799.00 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>For those to whom money is no object or require the highest-end performance an iPad can deliver, the iPad Pros are the only choice. Recently upgraded to the latest M2 processor, these are devices that absolutely fly. Every appointment is top-notch, from the Liquid Retina XDR displays with super-smooth ProMotion technology, to the USB-C ports that support Thunderbolt 4. These are Pro devices. With that is the caveat that most people won’t necessarily see these benefits unless they are using pro-level apps that push the device hard. </p>\n\n<p>The Pro comes in two sizes – 11-inch and 12.9-inch – with the latter being an absolute whopper. If you need a large screen then this is as big as it gets, but it comes with a 685g weight that makes it easily the heaviest iPad available. So, good for the eyes, bad for the hands. </p>\n\n<p>To anyone other than a professional designer, animator or digital specialist who can harness the power of the iPad Pros, these are simply too much and your money would be better spent on the iPad Air. But, if that’s you or you just want a luxury iPad to enjoy, then this is the premium end of the street. </p>\n\n<p>The iPad Pro 11-inch (2022) is available in the following configurations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>128GB: $799/£899</li>\n\n<li>256GB: $899/£1,019</li>\n\n<li>512GB: $1,099/£1,249</li>\n\n<li>1TB: $1,499/£1,699</li>\n\n<li>2TB: $1,899/£2,149</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want 5G cellular capabilities, then these are the options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>128GB (Cellular): $999/£1,079</li>\n\n<li>256GB (Cellular): $1,099/£1,199</li>\n\n<li>512GB (Cellular): $1,299/£1,429</li>\n\n<li>1TB (Cellular): $1,699/£1,879</li>\n\n<li>2TB (Cellular): $2,099/£2,329</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2022) is available in these configurations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>128GB: $1,099/£1,249</li>\n\n<li>256GB: $1,199/£1,369</li>\n\n<li>512GB: $1,399/£1,599</li>\n\n<li>1TB: $1,799/£2,049</li>\n\n<li>2TB: $2,199/£2,499</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the prices for the cellular-equipped models:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>128GB (Cellular): $1,299/£1,429</li>\n\n<li>256GB (Cellular): $1,399/£1,549</li>\n\n<li>512GB (Cellular): $1,599/£1,779</li>\n\n<li>1TB (Cellular): $1,999/£2,229</li>\n\n<li>2TB (Cellular): $2,399/£2,679</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676751/best-ipad-pro-m1-deals.html\">best iPad Pro deals</a> to see if you can get a good bargain on these flagship devices.</p>\n\n<p>We think that the iPad Pro will get an M3 chip in 2024, and maybe a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/14-inch-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">14-inch iPad Pro</a> will arrive.  </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"db4cba6fdc2f26bc24ceb4e7cd3a236f24772a1a1d13b0b355e619fea4a3c0ad","category":"Apple"}
