Having said that, the claim is not outside the realm of possibility. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/is-128gb-enough-iphone-storage/\">Is 128GB Enough iPhone Storage?</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nIf Apple drops 128GB as the base on the iPhone 16 Pro, that will leave three Pro storage options across the board: 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's also worth noting that in 2018, Apple's premium iPhone X came with 64GB, an entry-level storage tier that persisted in successive generations until the iPhone 13 in 2021, when Apple adopted 128GB as the new baseline. If Apple makes 256GB the new minimum across its premium devices, it could be settling into a pattern of doubling the minimum capacity every three years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the other end of the scale, a rumor in January out of Korea <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/\">claimed</a> that both iPhone 16 Pro models will be available with double the maximum storage capacity as the iPhone 15 Pro devices, increasing from 1TB to 2TB. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe maximum storage increase is said to be a result of Apple's switch to higher-density Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash for higher storage models. Apple's use of QLC NAND could allow Apple to fit more storage into a smaller space and it is less expensive than Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND, which current iPhones use. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/31/every-iphone-16-rumor-weve-covered-so-far/#\">Every iPhone 16 Rumor We've Covered So Far</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThis year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are rumored to be getting <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/\">bigger display sizes</a>, increasing to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. The new display sizes will be the largest ever for the iPhone, and should also increase the physical space for internal components and parts.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/both-iphone-16-pro-models-256-base-storage/\">Both iPhone 16 Pro Models to Feature 256GB Base Storage, Claims Sketchy Rumor</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/both-iphone-16-pro-models-to-feature-256gb-base-storage-claims-sketchy-rumor.2424279/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ca51f70142b944045c6fb89f2033b1bb4a721511d4685281250218f03456da26","category":"Apple"}
