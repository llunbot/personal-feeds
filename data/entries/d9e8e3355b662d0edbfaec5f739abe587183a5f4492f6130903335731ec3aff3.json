But now, orbiting Earth on board the Space Shuttle, all of his hopes and dreams, everything he had worked on for the better part of a decade as an American scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, had come crashing down around him.</p>\n<p>Wang was the principal investigator of an experiment called the <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19820066627/downloads/19820066627.pdf\">Drop Dynamics Module</a>, which aimed to uncover the fundamental physical behavior of liquid drops in microgravity. He had largely built the experiment, and he then effectively won a lottery ticket when NASA selected him to fly on the 17th flight of the Space Shuttle program, the STS-51-B mission. Wang, along with six other crew members, launched aboard Space Shuttle <em>Challenger</em> in April 1985.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994083#p3\">Read 53 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994083&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d9e8e3355b662d0edbfaec5f739abe587183a5f4492f6130903335731ec3aff3","category":"Tech"}
