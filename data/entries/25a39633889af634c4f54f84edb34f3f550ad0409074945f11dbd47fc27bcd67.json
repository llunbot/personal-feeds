Much like ChatGPT and Google Gemini, Grok can now interpret what your phone sees and respond in real time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/grok-ai-logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nUsing Grok Vision, iPhone users can point their camera at an object and ask \"What am I looking at?\" – and the chatbot will reply aloud with a context-aware response. The feature is now available on the Grok iOS app, but Android users will need to wait a little longer for access.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to visual recognition, Voice Mode now supports multilingual audio, allowing users to converse with Grok in multiple languages. Real-time search is also integrated, giving the chatbot the ability to provide instant answers that reflect the latest information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe enhancements follow last week's rollout of Grok's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/grok-ai-chatbot-gains-memory-feature/\">new memory feature</a>, which enables the chatbot to recall past interactions – including user preferences and previously asked questions – to deliver more personalized replies and suggestions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Introducing Grok Vision, multilingual audio, and realtime search in Voice Mode.
