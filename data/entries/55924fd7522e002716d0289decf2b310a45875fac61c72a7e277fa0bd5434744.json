Sorry, but we’re not going to tell you otherwise; in fact, just the opposite: we’re going to share with you our list of the best road bike upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you happen to have £1,000-plus burning a hole in your pocket, worry not; some of our suggestions will easily swallow that up. But there are also upgrades you can make for less than £20 that will make a real difference to your bike, so that’s where we’ve started on our way up to the serious big ticket items. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of most upgrades can vary wildly, so don’t take our recommendations as too prescriptive: you might find a product you like that’s a lot cheaper than our suggestions, or be looking for the best of the best, with price not a consideration at all. You might also find second-hand premium products at a fraction of the cost on places like Ebay.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Bike upgrades for less than £20</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1.

Proper hydration is vital for performance on the bike and for safety in hot conditions, so bottle cages that hold your bottles securely while making them easy to access are essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are also an easy upgrade to shave a few grams or boost your style points.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bottle-cage\" target=\"_blank\">our guide to the best bottle cages</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.

Ideally you want to change both the cable inners and outers at the same time.

TPU inner tubes make great spares to carry with you, cutting down on bulk and weight. You probably only need one and may be carrying it around unused for ages, but that makes it even more handy if your spare tube doesn’t take up unnecessary space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bike upgrades for less than £100</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>6.

It’s surprising how much difference a quality pair of tyres can make to your ride though. They’ll normally be lighter than budget tyres and have significantly less rolling resistance with better grip, helping to liven up your ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the winter, a set of<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-winter-road-bike-tyres-stay-puncture-free\" target=\"_blank\"> winter tyres</a> can add to your road grip <em>and</em> help save you from punctures. Many will do so without much additional weight or rolling resistance over summer options. Most modern road bikes have tubeless-ready wheels, so you could invest in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">tubeless tyres</a>. You’ll need valves and sealant as well, but running tubeless can make your ride more comfortable, reduce rolling resistance and save you time fixing punctures. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you go tubeless, make sure you equip yourself with a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-tubeless-repair-tool\" target=\"_blank\">tubeless repair kit</a> while you’re at it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7.

For less than £100, you can buy a quality pair of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\" target=\"_blank\">pedals</a>, usually with carbon bodies to save a little weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve not switched to clipless pedals, it’s a good opportunity to try them out or maybe try a different pedal system with popular road offerings from Shimano, Look and Wahoo. New pedals are usually supplied with cleats, so if your pedals are at the end of their lives, it’s a good opportunity to refresh your cleats at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check out our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\" target=\"_blank\">guide to the best clipless pedals for road cycling</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bike upgrades for less than £500</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>8.

There are so many different designs out there that it can be hard to choose the best bike saddle for you. Higher end saddles will cost over £100, but brands usually have lower priced saddles in the same range, making it less expensive to find the right one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing that saddle preference is very personal, many saddle brands offer a money back guarantee if you decide a saddle isn’t for you. Others have test saddles available in some bike shops, so you can get a feel for a saddle before purchasing. A saddle upgrade can also take a chunk of weight out of your bike if it came fitted with a budget steel-railed number. Here are a couple of favourites that are popular with both men and women.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-womens-saddles\" target=\"_blank\">best women’s saddles</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>9. New handlebar</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"655\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/04202326/carbon_bars_buyers_guide_06_zipp_sl-70_aero-970x655.jpg\" alt=\"carbon_bars_buyers_guide_06_zipp_sl-70_aero\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/04202326/carbon_bars_buyers_guide_06_zipp_sl-70_aero-970x655.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/04202326/carbon_bars_buyers_guide_06_zipp_sl-70_aero-300x203.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/04202326/carbon_bars_buyers_guide_06_zipp_sl-70_aero-768x518.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/04202326/carbon_bars_buyers_guide_06_zipp_sl-70_aero-750x506.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/04202326/carbon_bars_buyers_guide_06_zipp_sl-70_aero-1140x770.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/04202326/carbon_bars_buyers_guide_06_zipp_sl-70_aero.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Handlebars are another item spanning a wide price range. There’s a mass of designs with different widths and different amounts of reach to the hoods and drops. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re spending over £100, you can expect a lightweight, quality item. Often carbon handlebars will replace alloy and aero bars usually fall into this price range, offering a more streamlined look, saving a few watts and providing more comfortable tops than a standard round bar. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>10. Winter wheels</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/06174647/deda_elementi_sl45db_carbon_wheelset_9-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"deda_elementi_sl45db_carbon_wheelset_9\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Top notch aero wheelsets (see below) often break the £1,000 barrier – although there are options costing below £1,000 too – but you can find many winter wheelsets that cost below £500. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They may not have the deep section of an aero set and will probably be made of alloy rather than carbon, but you should be able to find a set that is high quality, robust and durable and that will cope with poor riding conditions, allowing you to save your best wheels for when warmer weather returns.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bike upgrades for less than £1,000</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>11. Power meter</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"613\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/06171550/garmin_rallyfamily_ongoing22_crop-970x613.jpg\" alt=\"garmin_rallyfamily_ongoing22_crop\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/06171550/garmin_rallyfamily_ongoing22_crop-970x613.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/06171550/garmin_rallyfamily_ongoing22_crop-300x190.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/06171550/garmin_rallyfamily_ongoing22_crop-768x486.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/06171550/garmin_rallyfamily_ongoing22_crop-750x474.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/03/06171550/garmin_rallyfamily_ongoing22_crop.jpg 1080w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The price of a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-power-meters-an-aid-to-better-training\" target=\"_blank\">power meter</a> that measures left and right side output independently usually falls within this bracket. A power meter is a useful tool to judge your effort on rides and improve your pedalling technique. It also allows you to track trends in your fitness, making it a great addition if you want to improve as a rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>12. Oversize pulley wheels</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"610\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/07102701/oversize_pulley_wheel_systems_1_ceramic_speed_ospw-970x610.jpg\" alt=\"oversize_pulley_wheel_systems_1_ceramic_speed_ospw\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/07102701/oversize_pulley_wheel_systems_1_ceramic_speed_ospw-970x610.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/07102701/oversize_pulley_wheel_systems_1_ceramic_speed_ospw-300x189.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/07102701/oversize_pulley_wheel_systems_1_ceramic_speed_ospw-768x483.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/07102701/oversize_pulley_wheel_systems_1_ceramic_speed_ospw-1536x965.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/07102701/oversize_pulley_wheel_systems_1_ceramic_speed_ospw-750x471.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/07102701/oversize_pulley_wheel_systems_1_ceramic_speed_ospw-1140x716.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/07102701/oversize_pulley_wheel_systems_1_ceramic_speed_ospw.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re getting into flashy territory here, but <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/wheels-of-fortune-oversize-pulley-wheel-systems\" target=\"_blank\">oversize pulley wheel systems</a>, OSPWs, are a hit with the pros who want to save a few watts in their drivetrain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The larger jockey wheels turn more slowly and usually include ceramic bearings, which generate less friction, while the smaller angle through which the chain links have to move relative to one another also cuts down friction. They’re an expensive upgrade, but if you’ve bought a nice new bike, they’ll help it look the part.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bike upgrades for more than £1,000</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>13. Aero wheelset</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/06185139/campagnoloboraultrawto1_crop-970x706.jpg\" alt=\"two bike wheels overlapping on grass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/06185139/campagnoloboraultrawto1_crop-970x706.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/06185139/campagnoloboraultrawto1_crop-300x218.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/06185139/campagnoloboraultrawto1_crop-768x559.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/06185139/campagnoloboraultrawto1_crop-1536x1118.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/06185139/campagnoloboraultrawto1_crop-120x86.jpg 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/06185139/campagnoloboraultrawto1_crop-750x546.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/06185139/campagnoloboraultrawto1_crop-1140x830.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/06185139/campagnoloboraultrawto1_crop.jpg 2016w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although you can find top-notch wheels costing under £1,000, brands’ best wheelsets typically exceed the £1,000 mark. There’s a lot of development and tech that goes into the best bike wheels and at this price you’ll typically find a set that’s both aerodynamically tuned and lightweight. It’s a significant outlay, but a quality set of wheels will make a real difference to your ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>14. Electronic groupset</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"564\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07104014/shimano_105_di2_groupset-970x564.jpg\" alt=\"shimano_105_di2_groupset\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A groupset upgrade is another expensive purchase that can make a big difference. Once you exceed £1,000, you’re in the realm of electronic groupsets. Electronic shifting isn’t just about faster, more reliable changes than manual shifting, it also allows you to change how your shifting works, with sequential shifting and compensating shifting helping to ensure that you’re in the right gear every time after a shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-groupsets\" target=\"_blank\">our guide to road bike groupsets</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Looking for a present and out of ideas?
