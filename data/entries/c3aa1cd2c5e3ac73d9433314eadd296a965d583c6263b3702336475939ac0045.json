Not only has its high-end headphones not received a refresh since their debut in 2020, they are also one of the few remaining Apple devices to still sport a Lightning port. With no immediate rumors of an update anytime soon, engineer Ken Pillonel has taken it upon himself to do it himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pillonel, who previously added <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/550179/iphone-usb-c-ebay-auction-sold.html\">USB-C to the iPhone</a> before Apple, posted a video of the process to his YouTube channel <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@ExploringTheSimulation&amp;xcust=1-1-2250882-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Exploring the Simulation</a> and it’s surprisingly not that difficult. It doesn’t require any drilling or special tools, but you will need to buy a USB-C Flex board for 39.90 Swiss Franc (about $45). The mod adds USB-C charging but doesn’t provide USB-C audio due to the limitations of the AirPods Max’s processor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with previous mods, the USB-C plug fits perfectly in the space occupied by the Lightning port once the metal lip around the opening is removed. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The connector sits on top of the existing Lightning board but Pilonel designed a board that “doesn’t touch any of the tallest components.” He says he spent hours trying to find the right connector and it worked “on the first try.” However, he created a second version of the board with a flexible arm to eliminate excessive force on the other components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you’re tired of waiting for Apple to get around to upgrading AirPods Max with a USB-C port, now’s your chance to get it—without shelling out $550 for a brand new pair of headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performing this operation on your AirPods Max voids your warranty, naturally.</p>\n\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c3aa1cd2c5e3ac73d9433314eadd296a965d583c6263b3702336475939ac0045","category":"Apple"}
