That can be annoying, but NotebookLM is notâ€”this one actually works. NotebookLM, which helps you parse documents, videos, and more using Google's advanced AI models, has been available on the web <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/googles-new-notebooklm-app-builds-a-custom-ai-based-on-a-source-document/\">since 2023</a>, but Google recently confirmed it would finally get an Android app. You can get a look at the app now, but it's not yet available to install.</p>\n<p>Until now, NotebookLM was only a website. You can visit it on your phone, but the interface is clunky compared to the desktop version. The arrival of the mobile app will change that. Google said it plans to release the app at Google I/O in late May, but the listing is <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.labs.language.tailwind\">live in the Play Store early</a>. You can pre-register to be notified when the download is live, but you'll have to tide yourself over with the screenshots for the time being.</p>\n<p>NotebookLM relies on the same underlying technology as Google's other chatbots and AI projects, but instead of a general purpose robot, NotebookLM is only concerned with the documents you upload. It can assimilate text files, websites, and videos, including multiple files and source types for a single agent. It has a hefty context window of 500,000 tokens and supports document uploads as large as 200MB. Google says this creates a queryable \"AI expert\" that can answer detailed questions and brainstorm ideas based on the source data.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/google-finally-reveals-notebooklm-android-app-but-you-cant-use-it-yet/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/google-finally-reveals-notebooklm-android-app-but-you-cant-use-it-yet/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"db4bdc459d5f4a24a4171619d63ff8a437d55a06947cf97a5f52b91ed268f13f","category":"Tech"}
