Its use allows manufacturers to apply very thin layers of materials onto semiconductor devices, including camera components.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn terms of camera lenses, ALD can be used to apply anti-reflective coatings, which can help to reduce photographic artifacts like streaks of light and halos that can occur in the final image when a bright light source such as the sun shines directly into the lens.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/iphone-16-pro-models-rumored-features/\">iPhone 16 Pro Expected Later This Year With These 12 New Features</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nALD can also reduce ghosting, a type of image distortion where faint, secondary images appear in the photo, typically opposite a bright light source. This happens when light reflects back and forth between the surfaces of the lens elements and the camera sensor.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, ALD-applied materials can protect against environmental damage to the camera lens system without affecting the sensor's ability to capture light effectively. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Naver blog claims that the manufacturing process will be applied to a \"Pro model\" in Apple's \"next-generation\" iPhone lineup, which sounds like a reference to one or both premium models in the iPhone 16 series, although given the timing of the rumor, the possibility that this method is being tested for next year's iPhone 17 Pro models should not be discounted.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-five-rumored-features-2025/\">Seven Reasons to Wait for Next Year's iPhone 17</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nBoth upcoming iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/\">tetraprism lens with up to 5x optical zoom</a> â€“ a feature that is currently exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max in Apple's smartphone lineup.
