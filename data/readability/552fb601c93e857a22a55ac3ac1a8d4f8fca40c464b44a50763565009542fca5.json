Still made entirely in Italy, the new 2022 Basso Palta II is both quicker and more off-road-ready thanks to expanded tire clearance, subtly tweaked geometry, increased bump-absorbing comfort, aerodynamic reshaping, and complete integration. It’s even a little bit lighter than before…</p><h2>2022 Basso Palta II made-in-Italy carbon gravel bike</h2><div id=\"attachment_274050\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110125/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_idyllic-Dolomiti-gravel-roads.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-274050\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110125/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_idyllic-Dolomiti-gravel-roads.jpg\" alt=\"2022 Basso Palta II carbon gravel bike review made-in-Italy, photo by Francesco Bonato,&nbsp;riding\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110125/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_idyllic-Dolomiti-gravel-roads.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110125/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_idyllic-Dolomiti-gravel-roads-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110125/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_idyllic-Dolomiti-gravel-roads-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110125/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_idyllic-Dolomiti-gravel-roads-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110125/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_idyllic-Dolomiti-gravel-roads-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-274050\">c.

But while there is a long list of features that have been tweaked and overhauled from their first real gravel bikes, Basso has stuck true to their road-racing background. And this new Palta II is very much still a Basso-style gravel bike, quick-handling but now more off-road ready too…</p><p>In fact, we already were pretty happy with the unique road-inspired fast feel of the first Palta, and Basso worked hard to maintain that while updating this next-gen carbon gravel bike.</p><h3>What’s new?</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110129/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_angled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110129/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_angled.jpg\" alt=\"2022 Basso Palta II carbon gravel bike review made-in-Italy, angled\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110129/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_angled.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110129/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_angled-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110129/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_angled-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110129/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_angled-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110129/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_angled-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110129/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_angled-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Boiling it down to the essentials, the all-new bike is: lighter, more aerodynamic, more integrated, more comfortable, more equipped for adventure, and it fits bigger tires now up to 45mm.

I correctly guessed that the new bike would retain Basso’s road-inspired ride and upgrade to full integrated cable routing like their latest road bikes. I figured that tire clearance would only grow incrementally, but didn’t really anticipate how much more capable the new gravel bike would become off-road.</p><p>Interestingly, what’s not super new is the bike’s geometry, more or less unchanged from the original Palta as Basso worked hard to preserve that road racing character, refined for gravel riding &amp; racing… call it a gravel road bike.</p><h3>Slightly refined Fast Gravel geometry</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110136/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110136/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry.jpg\" alt=\"2022 Basso Palta II carbon gravel bike review made-in-Italy, photo by Francesco Bonato,&nbsp;adventure gravel geometry\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110136/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry.jpg 2000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110136/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-297x178.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110136/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-800x480.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110136/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110136/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-768x461.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110136/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></p><p>Basso kept the core head &amp; seat angles effectively the same as before to preserve their ideal quick handling. The new Palta II’s frame Stack &amp; Reach are tweaked a bit, but Basso says this was less about changing rider position and more adapting to where people actually set their bars.</p><p>The new bike features ~2cm taller stack for the more comfortable &amp; standard performance positioning, yet without needing a tall spacer stack. Most riders should be able to get by with fewer spacers now, and those looking for the most aggressive setup can still #slamthatstem. Small shifts happen in frame Reach too, but mostly to have more consistent reach spreads across the larger frame sizes.</p><p>Surprisingly, the new bikes get 5mm shorter chainstays while increasing tire clearance by as much. But they also pair that with more fork offset for longer front center lengths and improved off-road handling, effectively moving rider weight balance a bit back in the process.</p><h3>Tech details</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110140/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_little-ring-mountain-top.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110140/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_little-ring-mountain-top.jpg\" alt=\"2022 Basso Palta II carbon gravel bike review made-in-Italy, photo by Francesco Bonato,&nbsp;frameset detail\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110140/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_little-ring-mountain-top.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110140/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_little-ring-mountain-top-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110140/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_little-ring-mountain-top-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110140/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_little-ring-mountain-top-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110140/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_little-ring-mountain-top-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110140/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_little-ring-mountain-top-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Getting back into the details, the reduction in weight comes down to refined carbon layup, but Basso admits the weight savings is probably in the tens of grams after moving to larger diameter tube shapes, as well. The made-in-Italy Palta II is still not meant to be an ultralight frameset, and while Basso hasn’t yet shared an official frame weight figure, it looks to hover just under the 1000g level.</p><p>Improved aerodynamics is a bit easier. More dramatic tube shaping, squared &amp; aero with Kamm tail profiles reduces drag with a nice side benefit of actually making for a more seamless &amp; stable setup with bikepacking frame &amp; saddle packs.</p><p>The unique forward-swept Basso fork design returns with more offset and wider open clearance as its crown transitions more smoothly into the downtube for aerodynamics, but with improved vibration damping in the legs as well.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110145/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_integrated-cockpit.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110145/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_integrated-cockpit.jpg\" alt=\"2022 Basso Palta II carbon gravel bike review made-in-Italy, photo by Francesco Bonato,&nbsp;integrated cockpit\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110145/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_integrated-cockpit.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110145/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_integrated-cockpit-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110145/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_integrated-cockpit-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110145/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_integrated-cockpit-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110145/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_integrated-cockpit-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p>Improved integration comes by way of full internal cable routing (1x &amp; 2x, electronic or mechanical compatible) through a straight 1.5″ headset and a stack of split 5mm spacers.

But my first impressions can be summed up as the new gravel bike being more well-rounded than ever.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110204/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_fast-and-loose.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110204/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_fast-and-loose.jpg\" alt=\"2022 Basso Palta II carbon gravel bike review made-in-Italy, photo by Francesco Bonato,&nbsp;descending\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110204/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_fast-and-loose.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110204/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_fast-and-loose-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110204/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_fast-and-loose-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110204/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_fast-and-loose-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/08110204/Basso-Palta-II-upgraded-fast-carbon-gravel-bike_made-in-Italy_photo-by-Francesco-Bonato_fast-and-loose-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p>Without really giving up the fast on-road speed &amp; handling that made the original Palta ride like a road bike, the new Palta II feels even more capable of heading off-road over steeper, more technical terrain now. The new Palta II still feels firmly planted in Basso’s made-in-Italy road bike heritage, but there’s nothing stopping you now from heading deeper off the beaten path.</p><section><a href=\"https://www.bassobikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>BassoBikes.com</em></a></section></section></div>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"552fb601c93e857a22a55ac3ac1a8d4f8fca40c464b44a50763565009542fca5","category":"Cycling"}
