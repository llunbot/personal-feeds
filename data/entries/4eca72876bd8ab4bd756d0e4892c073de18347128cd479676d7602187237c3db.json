{"title":"AWS Week in Review – March 27, 2023","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-week-in-review-march-27-2023/","date":1679925880000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/tag/week-in-review/\">This post is part of our Week in Review series. Check back each week for a quick roundup of interesting news and announcements from AWS!</a></p> \n<p>In Finland, where I live, spring has arrived. The snow has melted, and the trees have grown their first buds. But I don’t get my hopes high, as usually around Easter we have what is called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz70IgmrpG4\" target=\"_blank\">takatalvi</a>. Takatalvi is a Finnish world that means that the winter returns unexpectedly in the spring.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last Week’s Launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some launches that got my attention during the previous week.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS SAM CLI –</strong> Now the <code>sam sync</code> command will compare your local <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model\">Serverless Application Model</a> (AWS SAM) template with your deployed <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">AWS CloudFormation</a> template and skip the deployment if there are no changes. For more information, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/releases/tag/v1.78.0\">latest version of the AWS SAM CLI</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>IAM –</strong> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> has launched <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html\" target=\"_blank\">two new global condition context</a> keys. With these new condition keys, you can write <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html\" target=\"_blank\">service control policies (SCPs)</a> or IAM policies that restrict the VPCs and private IP addresses from which your <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</a> instance credentials can be used, without hard-coding VPC IDs or IP addresses in the policy. To learn more about this launch and how to get started, see <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-policies-to-restrict-where-ec2-instance-credentials-can-be-used-from/\">How to use policies to restrict where EC2 instance credentials can be used from</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon SNS – </strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sns/\">Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)</a> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/03/amazon-sns-content-type-request-headers-http-s-notifications/\" target=\"_blank\">now supports setting context-type request headers</a> for HTTP/S notifications, such as <code>application/json</code>, <code>application/xml</code>, or <code>text/plain</code>. With this new feature, applications can receive their notifications in a more predictable format.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Batch – </strong><a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/batch\">AWS Batch</a> now allows you to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/03/aws-batch-configurable-ephemeral-storage-fargate/\" target=\"_blank\">configure ephemeral storage up to 200GiB</a> on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">AWS Fargate</a> type jobs. With this launch, you no longer need to limit the size of your data sets or the size of the Docker images to run machine learning inference.</p> \n<p><strong>Application Load Balancer – </strong><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html\">Application Load Balancer</a> (ALB) now supports <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/03/application-load-balancer-tls-1-3/\" target=\"_blank\">Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.3</a>, enabling you to optimize the performance of your application while keeping it secure. TLS 1.3 on ALB works by offloading encryption and decryption of TLS traffic from your application server to the load balancer.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon IVS –</strong> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ivs/\">Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS)</a> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/03/amazon-ivs-multiple-hosts-live-streams/\" target=\"_blank\">now supports combining videos from multiple hosts into the source of a live stream</a>. For a demo, refer to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/add-multiple-hosts-to-live-streams-with-amazon-ivs/\">Add multiple hosts to live streams with Amazon IVS</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/24/Image-3-1.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/24/Image-3-1.jpeg\" alt width=\"1025\" height=\"577\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a></p> \n<p><span><strong>Other AWS News</strong></span><br /> Some other updates and news that you may have missed:</p> \n<p>I read the post <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/implementing-an-event-driven-serverless-story-generation-application-with-chatgpt-and-dall-e/\">Implementing an event-driven serverless story generation application with ChatGPT and DALL-E</a> a few days ago, and since then I have been reading my child a lot of <strong> AI-generated stories</strong>. In this post, David Boyne, explains step by step how you can create an event-driven serverless story generation application. This application produces a brand-new story every day at bedtime with images, which can be played in audio format.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/24/My-First-Board-Frame-1-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/24/My-First-Board-Frame-1-1-1024x319.png\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"319\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong>Podcast Charlas Técnicas de AWS – </strong>If you understand Spanish, this podcast is for you.
