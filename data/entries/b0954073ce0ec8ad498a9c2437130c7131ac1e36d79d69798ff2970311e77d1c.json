The Google I/O developer conference is next week, on May 10, where we hope to learn more about the Pixel Fold. But before then, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evleaks\">Evan Blass</a> has posted the official pictures of the device. Blass' account is private, but the pictures are re-hosted in several places now, like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/29/23703925/google-pixel-fold-leak-evan-blass-marketing-renders\">The Verge</a>.</p>\n<p>The most interesting picture shows the inner display in its 7.6-inch glory. Compared to the designs of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-4-gets-a-bit-wider-keeps-1799-price-tag/\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/huaweis-foldable-is-thinner-lighter-and-has-more-battery-than-samsung/\">Huawei</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/xiaomis-first-foldable-smartphone-takes-on-the-samsung-galaxy-fold/\">Xiaomi</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/oppos-foldable-phones-take-on-samsung-with-a-flip-phone-and-a-tablet/\">Oppo</a>, Google made many unique and interesting design decisions here. The first was the decision not to use an in-screen camera like basically all other foldables and instead to shrink the screen, creating a large top bezel for the camera. There seems to be nothing else in that bezel other than that tiny circle, though, which is a huge waste of space.</p>\n<p>The bottom bezel is also supersized compared to other devices on the market. The faint outline in the bezel represents the raised, plastic part of the bezel. Foldables have a raised rim all along the edge of the display to keep the display connected to the phone (foldable displays, since they have to fold, are not entirely bonded to the body) and to prevent the two halves of the display from rubbing against each other. It feels weird to dust off bezel complaints in 2023, but foldables <em>are</em> devices with significant size and weight concerns since they are supposed to fit into a pocket, and this is already a clear area where Google could improve. Foldables becoming lighter and more compact will be <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/xiaomi-clones-the-galaxy-fold-makes-it-40-thinner-adds-a-bigger-battery/\">a big battleground</a> in the future.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935588#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935588&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b0954073ce0ec8ad498a9c2437130c7131ac1e36d79d69798ff2970311e77d1c","category":"Tech"}
