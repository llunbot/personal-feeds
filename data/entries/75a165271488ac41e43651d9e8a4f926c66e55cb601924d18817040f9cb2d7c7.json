The film captures Napoleon's famous battles, relentless ambition and astounding strategic mind as an extraordinary military leader and war visionary.</blockquote>\"Napoleon\" has received Academy Award nominations for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, and Best Visual Effects. This year's Oscar winners will be announced at the 96th Academy Awards on March 10.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nScott's film has drawn both praise and criticism from audiences and reviewers. It has been recognized for its technical excellence, epic battle scenes, and some strong performances, including Vanessa Kirby's portrayal of Josephine in particular. But the script has also faced some criticism for its historical accuracy and a somewhat shallow exploration of a complex historical figure. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nScott is also releasing a four-hour-long cut of \"Napoleon\", exclusive to ‌Apple TV+‌, with extra scenes and the potential to address some of these criticisms, although it's not clear when this will arrive on the streaming service.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Apple TV+‌ received a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-tv-price-increasing-significantly/\">price increase in October</a>, and the service now costs $9.99 per month in the U.S. for new and existing subscribers.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/napoleon-apple-tv-plus-march-1/\">Ridley Scott's Action Epic 'Napoleon' Coming to Apple TV+ on March 1</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ridley-scotts-action-epic-napoleon-coming-to-apple-tv-on-march-1.2419842/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"75a165271488ac41e43651d9e8a4f926c66e55cb601924d18817040f9cb2d7c7","category":"Apple"}
