Six days ago Gurman claimed that the machines would be introduced \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/gurman-iphone-se-4-by-next-week/\">within weeks</a>.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA launch has been thought to be imminent for a while now. In fact, it was originally rumored to be planned as Apple's first hardware launch of the year. However, that is now likely to be the iPhone SE 4, which is expected to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/iphone-se-coming-wednesday-rumor-roundup/\">announced on Wednesday</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple inadvertently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/macos-sequoia-15-2-m4-macbook-air-leak/\">confirmed</a> the upcoming M4 ‌MacBook Air‌ machines back in December when the macOS Sequoia 15.2 software update included files for unreleased \"Mac16,12\" and \"Mac16,13\" machines. The files referenced the \"‌‌MacBook Air‌‌ (13-inch, M4, 2025)\" and the \"‌‌MacBook Air‌‌ (15-inch, M4, 2025).\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince then, we've just been waiting for the new ‌MacBook Air‌ models to launch.
