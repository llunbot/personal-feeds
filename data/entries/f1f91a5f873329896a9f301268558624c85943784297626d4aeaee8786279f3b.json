Today, OpenAI struck back with the public release of o3-mini, its latest simulated reasoning model and the first of its kind the company will offer for free to all users without a subscription.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/\">First teased last month</a>, OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/\">brags in today's announcement</a> that o3-mini \"advances the boundaries of what small models can achieve.\" Like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/\">September's o1-mini before it</a>, the model has been optimized for STEM functions and shows \"particular strength in science, math, and coding\" despite lower operating costs and latency than o1-mini, OpenAI says.</p>\n<h2>Harder, better, faster, stronger</h2>\n<p>Users are able to choose from three different \"reasoning effort options\" when using o3-mini, allowing them to fine-tune a balance between latency and accuracy depending on the task. The lowest of these reasoning levels generally shows accuracy levels comparable to o1-mini in math and coding benchmarks, according to OpenAI, while the highest matches or surpasses the full-fledged o1 model in the same tests.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/openai-hits-back-at-deepseek-with-o3-mini-reasoning-model/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/openai-hits-back-at-deepseek-with-o3-mini-reasoning-model/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f1f91a5f873329896a9f301268558624c85943784297626d4aeaee8786279f3b","category":"Tech"}
