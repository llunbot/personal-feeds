The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">2023 Tour de France</a> gets underway in Bilbao, Spain on 1st July, and this year there are seven British riders among the 176 starters facing 3,404km of riding over the next three weeks to reach Paris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s one less than at the start line last year, the most surprising omission being Chris Froome (Israel-Premier Tech), who is still determined to make one last big splash at the race he’s won four times, but his team decided it wasn’t going to be this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From potential record breakers to Netflix stars to a few debutants, here are the seven British riders at the Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.

Will <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mark-cavendish-interview-2\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Cavendish</a> win one more stage at the Tour de France? The Manx Missile currently shares the all-time stage win record of 34 with Eddy Merckx and recently finished his final Giro d’Italia with a tremendous sprint victory on the last stage in Rome complete with a leadout from friend and former teammate Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is probably why Astana Qazaqstan has <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-national-championships\" target=\"_blank\">hired Mark Renshaw</a> as a sprint and leadout consultant. Renshaw helped Cavendish to many a victory as one of the greatest leadout men in the history of the sport and will be aiming to help shape Astana into a team capable of delivering Cavendish to at least one more Grand Tour stage victory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be Cavendish’s last Tour de France as he <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/mark-cavendish-retirement\" target=\"_blank\">announced his retirement</a> at the end of the 2023 season. Expect that to be sooner should he win in Paris. Fingers crossed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.

The man from London will turn up to the start line of the Tour de France looking resplendent in his new national championship kit following his <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/british-national-championships-2023-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">road race victory</a> in Saltburn, where he beat out James Knox and Stephen Williams to raise his arms in the air in memory of his late teammate <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-tour-de-suisse\" target=\"_blank\">Gino Mäder</a>. It was Wright’s first professional win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep an eye on him as he’ll undoubtedly work his way into a few breakaways and, given his form, could well get another famous win. Go well Fred.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

The 27-year-old rode for Lotto Soudal (now Lotto-Dstny) in 2017–2018. Since then, he’s been racing with the likes of Continental teams SwiftCarbon Pro Cycling and Ribble-Weldtite. Shaw signed a contract with EF Education-EasyPost from 2022 and will be making his debut in the race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said, ‘I have this attitude in life that there are two people that you have got to make proud and they are the eight-year-old version of yourself and the eighty-year-old version of yourself. As long as the eight-year-old version of you looks up to you at the minute and thinks yeah, that guy is who I want to be and the eighty-year-old version of you looks back at you and says yeah, that is the person that I wanted to be, then it doesn’t really matter what anyone else thinks or feels. I think the eight-year-old version of James would be blown away right now.’ <em>Allez </em>James.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.
