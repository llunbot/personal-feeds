OnePlus offers proprietary 65 W quick charging, and Qualcomm's latest charging solution can hit <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/07/qualcomm-quick-charge-5-can-charge-your-phone-in-15-minutes/\">100 W</a>. Google says the Pixel 6 can be charged at 30 W, which is slower than the best Android phones in its price range.</p>\n<p>Our review of the phone noted that the Pixel 6's charging felt slow, but a report from <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-charging-test-3051231/\">Android Authority's</a> Robert Triggs says that the Pixel 6 doesn't even live up to the modest 30 W claims it makes on the spec sheet. In testing, Triggs could only get the phone to hit peaks of 22 W—and even then, not for very long. In his testing, it took 111 minutes to fully charge the Pixel 6 Pro's 5000 mAh battery from zero to 100 percent, even with the official \"30 W\" Google adapter (which is not included in the box).</p>\n<p>Samsung is a great counter-example. The 5000 mAh Galaxy S21 Ultra can charge from 0 to 100 in 62 minutes—that's 49 minutes faster than the \"30 W\" Pixel 6—despite Samsung only advertising \"25 W\" quick charging. Triggs says the Galaxy S21 Ultra actually peaks at 28 W during charging—faster than advertised.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811138#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811138&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9031a1bd7626fb48489915f45d527547c984bc6f3ce346db0f81f94eabc0fad4","category":"Tech"}
