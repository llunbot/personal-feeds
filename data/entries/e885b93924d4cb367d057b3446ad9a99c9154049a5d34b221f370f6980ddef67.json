{"title":"iOS 15 Messages Bug Causes Saved Photos to Be Deleted","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/29/ios-15-messages-bug-deleting-photos/","date":1632947330000,"content":"A serious bug in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> Messages app can cause some saved photos to be deleted, according to multiple complaints we've heard from <em>MacRumors</em> readers and Twitter users.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/iOs-15-Photos-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you save a photo from a Messages thread and then go on to delete that thread, the next time an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Backup is performed, the photo will disappear.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEven though the image is saved to your personal <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-photo-library/\">iCloud Photo Library</a>, it appears to still be linked to the Messages app in â€ŒiOS 15â€Œ, and saving it does not persist through the deletion of the thread and an â€ŒiCloudâ€Œ backup.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo replicate this bug, the following steps must be taken:\r\n<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Save a photo from a Messages conversation to your Camera Roll.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Check to see that the photo has been saved.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Delete the Messages conversation the photo came from. The photo will still be in your â€ŒiCloud Photo Libraryâ€Œ at this point.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Perform an â€ŒiCloudâ€Œ Backup, and the photo disappears.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ol>\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a concern because most users keep the â€ŒiCloudâ€Œ Backup feature enabled and it's something that happens automatically. If you're someone who regularly deletes message threads, if there's a photo that you want to keep, you won't be able to keep it with â€ŒiCloudâ€Œ Backup turned on. We tested this bug on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> running iOS 15.1 beta 2 and had our photo deleted after deleting the Messages thread and performing an â€ŒiCloudâ€Œ Backup, so the issue has not been addressed in the current beta as of yet.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>15.1 beta 2 is still deleting photos from my library when I delete the iMessage thread I saved them from ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜° FB9658241</p>â€” Ezekiel (@superezfe) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/superezfe/status/1443196471160066050?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 29, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nUntil this bug is fixed, if you've downloaded photos from the Messages app, you'll want to make sure to keep those Messages conversations and not delete them to prevent them from being automatically removed from your devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Thanks, Chad!)</em><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/29/ios-15-messages-bug-deleting-photos/\">iOS 15 Messages Bug Causes Saved Photos to Be Deleted</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-15-messages-bug-causes-saved-photos-to-be-deleted.2314464/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BUaH7mhks6U:Qbq1U721MVA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BUaH7mhks6U:Qbq1U721MVA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/BUaH7mhks6U\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e885b93924d4cb367d057b3446ad9a99c9154049a5d34b221f370f6980ddef67","category":"Apple"}
