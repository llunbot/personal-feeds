Cross may be coming first, but winter is not far behind either. For 45Nrth, riding through the cold snowy winters means keeping your extremities warm, and keeping the rubber side down. And for this coming winter, they’ve got new Ragnarök boots and a new fast-rolling Dillinger 4 studded fat bike tire. Plus, there’s new socks, gloves &amp; headwear to keep you warm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And more is on the way in their <em>Winter: We’re Here For It</em> teaser…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>45NRTH Cold weather gear, “<em>Winter: We’re Here For It</em>”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>45Nrth says their 2023-2024 winter campaign anthem is “<em>designed to share our winter stoke with like-minded cold weather riders and encourage our fair-weather friends to extend their riding seasons and try something new this winter</em>“. But it’s also a teaser of several new product launches that will debut this fall. We spotted plenty goodies new and old that suggests new colors are coming to current gear. And there are new merino socks to keep your toes cozy, and more new options in caps, neck gaiters &amp; full-on balaclavas to keep the chill at bay.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cycling-boots-and-Dillinger-4-studded-fatbike-tire_riding.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cycling-boots-and-Dillinger-4-studded-fatbike-tire_riding.jpg\" alt=\"45Nrth Winter 2023-24 teaser, redesigned Ragnarök cold weather boots, studded Dillinger 4 tires &amp; more...\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cycling-boots-and-Dillinger-4-studded-fatbike-tire_riding.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cycling-boots-and-Dillinger-4-studded-fatbike-tire_riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cycling-boots-and-Dillinger-4-studded-fatbike-tire_riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cycling-boots-and-Dillinger-4-studded-fatbike-tire_riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cycling-boots-and-Dillinger-4-studded-fatbike-tire_riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cycling-boots-and-Dillinger-4-studded-fatbike-tire_riding-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all photos c. 45Nrth</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But also it looks like their popular winter riding boots get updated again, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Ragnarök “transition season” cycling boot</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cold-weather-cycling-boots_side.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cold-weather-cycling-boots_side.jpg\" alt=\"45Nrth Winter 2023-24 teaser, redesigned Ragnarök cold weather cycling boots, side Glacier gray\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cold-weather-cycling-boots_side.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cold-weather-cycling-boots_side-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cold-weather-cycling-boots_side-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cold-weather-cycling-boots_side-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Ragnarok-cold-weather-cycling-boots_side-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not quite a full deep-winter boot for year-round riders in the far north, 45Nrth still rates the Ragnarök as comfortable down to 25°F/ -4°C.

To make that work, the tire features 3 taller, more aggressive blocks that span the fast-rolling center. But lower bridges now connect the lugs to prevent squirm. In between, 3 smaller trad lugs for a supportive central arrow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other big difference is in between the center and cornering shoulders, where one of the transition knobs is gone. Then the result now is, between each repeating set of lugs there are now only 4 carbide studs where there had been 6, reducing weight and drag with minimal impact on real grip.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Dillinger-4-fast-rolling-fatbike-tire_options.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"850\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Dillinger-4-fast-rolling-fatbike-tire_options.jpg\" alt=\"45Nrth Winter 2023-24 teaser, redesigned Dillinger 4 fast rolling fatbike tires, black or tan wall\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Dillinger-4-fast-rolling-fatbike-tire_options.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Dillinger-4-fast-rolling-fatbike-tire_options-297x168.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Dillinger-4-fast-rolling-fatbike-tire_options-800x453.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Dillinger-4-fast-rolling-fatbike-tire_options-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_redesigned-Dillinger-4-fast-rolling-fatbike-tire_options-768x435.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The redesigned tubeless-ready 45Nrth Dillinger 4 studded fatbike tire starts at $122 per tire in a 120tpi casing without studs, but ready for you to add as many as you want. For $162 you pick up the tire pre-studded with 168 carbide steel studs in the heavier 60tpi casing. Or then for $212 per tire you get the more supple 120tpi casing, and 168 large concave carbide aluminum studs already installed. So, pick from black or tan walls in some combinations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not cheap to get premium studded fatbike tires. But at the same time, it’s hard to argue with the grip if you ride through icy winters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What more is coming from 45Nrth for this winter?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_Ragnarok-boots_Dillinger-4-tires-and-more.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_Ragnarok-boots_Dillinger-4-tires-and-more.jpg\" alt=\"45Nrth Winter 2023-24 teaser, redesigned cold weather boots, studded tires &amp; more!\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_Ragnarok-boots_Dillinger-4-tires-and-more.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_Ragnarok-boots_Dillinger-4-tires-and-more-297x99.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_Ragnarok-boots_Dillinger-4-tires-and-more-800x267.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_Ragnarok-boots_Dillinger-4-tires-and-more-120x40.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_Ragnarok-boots_Dillinger-4-tires-and-more-768x256.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/45Nrth-Winter-2023-24-teaser_Ragnarok-boots_Dillinger-4-tires-and-more-1536x512.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What more is coming this autumn?
