After sliding out on a fast downhill corner and coming close to disaster over the gritty embankment, the Movistar co-leader briefly remounted before coming to a devastated stop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The coverage lingered on the Murcian as he was comforted by his team director and friend Chente García Costa. The emotional scene looked at the time like a bitter and premature end to a long and storied career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He came away with a broken collarbone that was operated on within days, and an injury to his ribs, but he was back on the indoor trainer in no time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Recovery is going well; the ribs still bother me,” he said. “In principle I return to Sicily, I’m thinking about Il Lombardia.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before starting his 12th season with Team Movistar, Valverde is expected to build to his goal of Il Lombardia – a race he’s never won but has finished runner-up three times – with a series of Italian races starting at the Tour of Sicily in late September. </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/alejandro-valverde-confirms-he-will-continue-racing-in-2022/\">Read More</a>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"06d9bf07fdc48438f9627d3e9cfbfe39e58c48bbc0f8e719dd4aa05e17128269","category":"Cycling"}
