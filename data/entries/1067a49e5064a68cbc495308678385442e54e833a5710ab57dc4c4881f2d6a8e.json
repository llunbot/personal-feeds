{"title":"How The Wall Street Journal Fell Behind in the ‘Apple Is Behind on AI’ Arms Race","link":"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/apple-ai-siri-development-behind-9ea65ee8","date":1717725674000,"content":"\n<p>Aaron Tilley, writing for The Wall Street Journal under the headline “How Apple Fell Behind in the AI Arms Race” (<a href=\"https://apple.news/AxK4bRgiQR8i3WpqPmcnFig\">News+ link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For those who saw them, the demonstrations inside Apple earlier\nthis decade of a revamped Siri offered a showcase of the amazing\ncapabilities a powerful AI voice assistant could have.</p>\n\n<p>The famed assistant, one of the last projects Apple co-founder\nSteve Jobs worked on before his death, had been given a total\noverhaul. Capable of running on an iPhone and without an internet\nconnection, the new Siri impressed people with its improved speed,\nconversational capabilities and the accuracy with which it\nunderstood user commands. Code-named Project Blackbird, the effort\nalso imagined a Siri with capabilities built by third-party app\ndevelopers, according to people familiar with the work.</p>\n\n<p>Yet a competing project won out in an internal contest ahead of\nthe 10-year anniversary of Siri’s launch. Known as Siri X, the\nmore-modest upgrade involved moving more existing Siri software\nonto iPhones from remote servers to improve the voice assistant’s\nspeed and privacy. The Siri X enhancement was unveiled in 2021.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tilley is the WSJ’s Apple beat reporter, and one gets the feeling he was tasked with filing a report with the above headline already written. These opening three paragraphs are the only interesting ones in the entire story. But there’s nothing actually new in them.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s Wayne Ma, reporting for The Information in April 2023 under the headline “<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-siri-chief-struggles-as-new-ai-era-begins\">Apple’s AI Chief Struggles With Turf Wars as New Era Begins</a>” (<a href=\"https://archive.is/fYvPH\">archive</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In some cases, Giannandrea’s new hires have run into seemingly\nimpenetrable bureaucratic obstacles. In one example, he in 2019\nrecruited another close friend, Arthur van Hoff, to explore a\nproject to rewrite Siri from the ground up. Code-named Blackbird,\nthe effort involved creating a lightweight version of Siri, which\nwould delegate the creation of more functions to app developers,\nsaid five former Siri employees. The software would run on iPhones\ninstead of in the cloud, which would improve Siri’s speed and\nperformance while enhancing user privacy, they said. Demos of\nBlackbird prompted excitement among employees on the Siri team\nbecause of its responsiveness, they added.</p>\n\n<p>But there was a problem. Blackbird competed with the work of two\nlongtime senior Siri leaders: Alex Acero and Robby Walker, who\nwere responsible for two important teams that helped Siri\nunderstand and respond to queries. Acero and Walker pushed for\ncompletion of their own project, code-named Siri X, for the 10th\nanniversary of the voice assistant, which aimed to move the Siri\nprocessing software onto the device for privacy reasons.</p>\n\n<p>However, Siri X’s goal was simply to reproduce Siri’s existing\ncapabilities without the more ambitious targets of Blackbird, the\npeople said. Despite that, Acero and Walker won. They assigned\nhundreds of people to their effort, which subsumed and killed\nBlackbird. Most of their project was completed in 2021.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Same story, but Ma’s version from <em>13 months ago</em> included the names of the engineers in charge of the dueling projects.</p>\n\n<p>Back to Tilley’s report at the WSJ yesterday:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple has long prided itself on perfection in its product\nrollouts, a near impossibility with emerging AI models. While\nOpenAI systems have dazzled more than 180 million users with their\ngeneration of writing, images and video, they are prone to\noccasional errors, often called hallucinations. Apple has had\nlimited tolerance for such issues.</p>\n\n<p>“There’s no such thing as 100% accuracy with AI, that’s the\nfundamental reality,” said Pedro Domingos, a professor emeritus of\ncomputer science and engineering at the University of Washington.\n“Apple is not compatible with that. They won’t release something\nuntil it’s perfect.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How does this square with the state of Siri as it works today? Does Tilley think today’s Siri, though limited in scope, is “100 percent accurate” and “perfect”?</p>\n\n<p>Don’t know about you, but that’s not my experience.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/06/how-the-wall-street-journal-fell-behind-in-the-apple-is-behind-on-ai-arms-race\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1067a49e5064a68cbc495308678385442e54e833a5710ab57dc4c4881f2d6a8e","category":"Tech"}
