Back in 2021, Apple said it would invest more than $1 billion in North Carolina, a project that included a new engineering and research center in the Research Triangle area of Raleigh and Durham.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/12/apple_rtp_land.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /><em>Assemblage of seven properties in Research Triangle Park owned by Apple</em></div>\r<br />\nA limited amount of progress on the campus has been made since the announcement, and Apple has not provided updates on construction until now. Apple told <em>Triangle Business Journal</em> that it has paused work on the campus, and it is working with North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and the North Carolina Department of Commerce to extend the project's timeline by four years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo reason was given for the delay, but Apple said that it is still committed to building in North Carolina.\r<br />\n<blockquote>Apple has been operating in North Carolina for over two decades. And we're deeply committed to growing our teams here. In the last three years, we've added more than 600 people to our team in Raleigh, and we're looking forward to developing our new campus in the coming years.</blockquote>\r<br />\nApple last year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/30/apple-north-carolina-campus-first-phase/\">filed development plans</a> for the first phase of construction, but the specific timeline for the project has never been clear. Apple's plans for Research Triangle Park include six buildings and a parking garage totaling 700,000 square feet of office space, 190,000 square feet of accessory space, and close to 3,000 parking spaces spanning 41 acres.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple owns 281 acres of land in the area where it plans to build its campus, so there could ultimately be several phases of construction. As it prepares to build the NC research center, Apple is leasing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/29/apple-metlife-campus-nc/\">more than 200,000 square feet</a> of office space in Cary, North Carolina.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-north-carolina-campus-paused/\">Apple Pauses Work on Planned North Carolina Campus</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pauses-work-on-planned-north-carolina-campus.2430005/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"07651f58f4adf90d3957b6a3357864d95c6146c769b6e080acf806dcaaa7aa39","category":"Apple"}
