One option is to clear the Starliner spacecraft to undock from the space station in early September with Wilmore and Williams onboard, as their flight plan initially laid out, or to bring the capsule home without its crew.</p>\n<p>As of Thursday, the two veteran astronauts have been on the space station for 77 days, nearly 10 times longer than their planned stay of eight days. Wilmore and Williams were the first people to launch and dock at the space station aboard a Starliner spacecraft, but multiple thrusters failed and the capsule leaked helium from its propulsion system as it approached the orbiting complex on June 6.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044910#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044910&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3c4deba144325cf58c09eda5f10ec57ef7066d2ec85284dda468b7175ad67fa6","category":"Tech"}
