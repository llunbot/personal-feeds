Recent measurements of the mass of the elementary particle known as the W boson provide a useful case study as to why. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/04/higher-w-boson-mass-hints-at-chinks-in-standard-models-armor/\">Last year</a>, Fermilab physicists caused a stir when they <a href=\"http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk1781\">reported a W boson mass measurement</a> that deviated rather significantly from theoretical predictions of the so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model\">Standard Model of Particle Physics</a>—a tantalizing hint of new physics. Others advised caution, since the measurement contradicted prior measurements.</p>\n<p>That caution appears to have been warranted. The ATLAS collaboration at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) <a href=\"https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CONFNOTES/ATLAS-CONF-2023-004/\">has announced</a> a new, improved analysis of their own W boson data and found the measured value for its mass was still consistent with Standard Model. Caveat: It's a preliminary result. But it lessens the likelihood of Fermilab's 2022 measurement being correct.</p>\n<p>\"The W mass measurement is among the most challenging precision measurements performed at hadron colliders,\" <a href=\"https://home.cern/news/press-release/physics/improved-atlas-result-weighs-w-boson\">said ATLAS spokesperson Andreas Hoecker</a>. \"It requires extremely accurate calibration of the measured particle energies and momenta, and a careful assessment and excellent control of modeling uncertainties. This updated result from ATLAS provides a stringent test, and confirms the consistency of our theoretical understanding of electroweak interactions.” </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926610#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926610&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"20fa7f502f8f6c15d1103e395610d3db5968d4a122b42b528248e8f10d8645b3","category":"Tech"}
