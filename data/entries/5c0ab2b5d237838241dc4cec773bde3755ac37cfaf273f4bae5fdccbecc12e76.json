Kroger was one of the largest Apple Pay holdouts in the U.S. since the service launched in 2014, alongside Walmart and The Home Depot, but it now accepts Apple Pay at some or all Kroger, Fred Meyer, Ralphs, QFC, King Soopers, and Harris Teeter locations across the country.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Pay allows customers to tap to pay with an iPhone or Apple Watch at checkout, providing a convenient and secure payment method. Alongside Apple Pay, Kroger continues to offer its own service called Kroger Pay, which requires customers to scan a QR code at checkout to pay with a debit or credit card stored in the Kroger app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Apple Pay was rolled out at all locations.</p>â€” Harris Teeter (@HarrisTeeter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HarrisTeeter/status/1651655922140192796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 27, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134\">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/28/harris-teeter-apple-pay/\">Kroger-Owned Grocery Store Chain Harris Teeter Begins Accepting Apple Pay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kroger-owned-grocery-store-chain-harris-teeter-begins-accepting-apple-pay.2388097/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5c0ab2b5d237838241dc4cec773bde3755ac37cfaf273f4bae5fdccbecc12e76","category":"Apple"}
