They are desperate to associate themselves with popular brands like the All Blacks and with New Zealand’s good name, but we shouldn’t let them get away with it.'</p>\n<p>In response to the criticism, chief executive of New Zealand Rugby Mark Robinson played down the environmental concerns and highlighted the opportunities that could arise from the partnership. </p>\n<p>'Ineos will bring an innovative approach and dedication to the partnership with our Teams in Black, qualities we see across all aspects of their business, particularly around sustainability with their commitment to deliver a zero-carbon emission future in line with the Paris Agreement.'</p>\n<p>In the wake of this deal, it is worth noting that the three-time rugby World Cup champions were considering selling a majority share of the team to private equity firms earlier in the year to alleviate major financial issues caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0341cdda062b5d0126e105de7d535ad55a72cb45c5695d5c1504342c0f5a6054","category":"Cycling"}
