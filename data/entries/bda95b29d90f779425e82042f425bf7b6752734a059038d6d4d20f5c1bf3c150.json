SearchGPT is able to respond to questions with up-to-date information from the web. SearchGPT is able to answer follow-up questions in a conversational manner, with shared context included with each additional query.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>We’re testing SearchGPT, a temporary prototype of new AI search features that give you fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources. <br /><br />We’re launching with a small group of users for feedback and plan to integrate the experience into ChatGPT. <a href=\"https://t.co/dRRnxXVlGh\">https://t.co/dRRnxXVlGh</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/iQpADXmllH\">pic.twitter.com/iQpADXmllH</a></p>— OpenAI (@OpenAI) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1816536290822881780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 25, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nOpenAI says that it is committed to a \"thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators\" and that it wants to help users discover publisher sites.

Sites can be surfaced in search results even if they've opted out of generative AI training.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThose interested in testing out SearchGPT can <a href=\"http://chatgpt.com/search\">join OpenAI's waitlist</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/openai-debuts-searchgpt-ai-search-engine/\">OpenAI Debuts SearchGPT AI Search Engine</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/openai-debuts-searchgpt-ai-search-engine.2432230/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bda95b29d90f779425e82042f425bf7b6752734a059038d6d4d20f5c1bf3c150","category":"Apple"}
