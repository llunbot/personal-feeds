The Minnesota-based tool giant is giving away seven 3D-printable pegboard holders for its most popular blue-handled bits and pieces, free of charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Park Tool pegboard hangers to 3D-print at home</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Park-Tool-3D-printed-peg-hook-holders-valve-.png\"><img width=\"1486\" height=\"462\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Park-Tool-3D-printed-peg-hook-holders-valve-.png\" alt=\"Park Tool 3D printed peg hook holders valve\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Park-Tool-3D-printed-peg-hook-holders-valve-.png 1486w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Park-Tool-3D-printed-peg-hook-holders-valve--297x92.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Park-Tool-3D-printed-peg-hook-holders-valve--120x37.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Park-Tool-3D-printed-peg-hook-holders-valve--768x239.png 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(All images / Park Tool)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep, free.

The same is the case for their fancier Professional Chain Tool that doesn’t have the hole in the handle like the more basic chain tools. And have you ever tried to hang a set of vernier calipers?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Park-Tool-3D-printed-peg-hook-holders-DAG-1-.png\"><img width=\"1616\" height=\"586\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Park-Tool-3D-printed-peg-hook-holders-DAG-1-.png\" alt=\"Park Tool 3D printed peg hook holders DAG -1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Park-Tool-3D-printed-peg-hook-holders-DAG-1-.png 1616w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Park-Tool-3D-printed-peg-hook-holders-DAG-1--297x108.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Park-Tool-3D-printed-peg-hook-holders-DAG-1--1536x557.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Park-Tool-3D-printed-peg-hook-holders-DAG-1--120x44.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Park-Tool-3D-printed-peg-hook-holders-DAG-1--768x278.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So Park Tool designed some 3D models that let you print your mountable holders for hard-to-hold Park staples like the CT-15 Pro chain tool, the heavy DAG derailleur alignment tools, digital calipers, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Park designed all of the 3D-print-ready files for standard American pegboard (9/32″ holes, 1″ spacing). They are clean, modular, and easy to install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to remix them for some non-Imperial pegboard, the popular diamond IKEA Skådis pegboard layout, or just your ultra-specific tool cabinet? Go wild. Park’s blessing encourages DIY modifications of the tool holders’ 3D model files.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>No 3D-Printer?

They are each quite specific to unique Park tools, but some look a bit more universal than others.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>CT-15-H3D – 3D Printable Pegboard Holder for CT-15 Pro chain tool</li>\n\n\n\n<li>VC-H3D – 3D Printable Pegboard Holders for VC-1 valve core remover</li>\n\n\n\n<li>UP-H3D – 3D Printable Pegboard Holder for UP-SET hex-handled utility picks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>DC-H3D – 3D Printable Pegboard Holder for Digital Calipers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AWS-H3D – 3D Printable Pegboard Holder for 3-Way Wrenches</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ATD-H3D – 3D Printable Pegboard Holder for ATD-1.2 adjustable t-handle torque wrench</li>\n\n\n\n<li>DAG-H3D – 3D Printable Pegboard Holder for Derailleur Hanger Alignment Gauges</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Given how clean and organized these look in renderings, we wouldn’t be surprised if Park expands this library to include more wrenches, things like specialized BB tools, caliper spacers, and more. Fingers crossed!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This feels like a classic Park Tool move— functional, generous, and geared toward making your workshop a better place. Whether you’re a basement wrench or a full-time shop mechanic, these holders hit that sweet spot of ‘form follows function’ with a dash of customization possibility. If you’ve got a 3D printer—or a buddy who does—download them now and give your tools the home they deserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.parktool.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ParkTool.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/park-tool-3d-print-designs/\">Free and Ready to Print: Park Tool Shares 3D-Printable Pegboard Tool Holders</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0236eda857a6be4ece66a6f8cc999f11cdeaa104de3fa1c8b1001638d9210169","category":"Cycling"}
