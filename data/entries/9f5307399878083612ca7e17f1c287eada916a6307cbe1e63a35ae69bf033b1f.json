Here's a sneak peek into what we can expect:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Bigger Display</h3>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n    <li>While the external designs are not expected to undergo major overall changes, we are expecting slight <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/\">increases in display size</a> and a new aspect ratio for the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models.</li>\r<br />\n    <li>A new Capture Button will be included on all four iPhone 16 models, and it will be used for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/iphone-16-capture-button-video/\">taking photos and videos</a> with more nuanced control.\r<br />\n</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Design Changes</h3>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li>The standard iPhone 16 models are expected to have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/22/iphone-16-vertical-camera-lenses-rumor/\">vertical camera layout</a>. Apple has used a diagonal layout for more recent iPhone models, but the swap may allow for spatial video recording using the Ultrawide and Wide cameras.</li>\r<br />\n<li>The iPhone 15 Pro models include an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/21/iphone-16-everything-new-action-button-will-do/\">Action Button</a>, and in 2024, the Action Button is expected to be expanded to the standard iPhone 16 models. The Action Button used across the iPhone 16 lineup will be identical to the iPhone 15 Pro Action Button. The Action button, which replaces the traditional mute switch, can perform multiple functions such as activating the Flashlight, turning on the Camera, launching a Shortcut, enabling or disabling a Focus mode, using Translate, turning on/off Silent Mode, and more.\r<br />\n</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Apple Intelligence and Improved Siri</h3>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li>With iOS 18.1, Apple will introduce Apple Intelligence, a suit of AI tools powered by large language models. Apple Intelligence only works with current iPhone 15 Pro models, and some of the more cutting-edge generative AI features could be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/\">limited to the iPhone 16 models</a> further down the line.</li>\r<br />\n    <li>The iPhone 16 models are rumored to feature an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-iphone-16-microphone-upgrade-siri-ai/\">upgraded microphone</a> in order to enhance the Siri experience significantly.
