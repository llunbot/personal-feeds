{"title":"Opinion: Bring back the maglia nera at the Giro d’Italia","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/maglia-nera-giro-ditalia","date":1748619852000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/maglia-nera-giro-ditalia\">Opinion: Bring back the maglia nera at the Giro d’Italia</a></p>\n\n<p>The <em>maglia nera </em>was to the Giro d’Italia what the<em> lanterne rouge</em> is to the Tour de France: something to mark the last placed rider in the general classification. It only featured in the race for six years in the mid 20th century, but it made quite the impression, and I think it’s time to bring it back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cycling understandably focusses on the riders competing for victory, but those fighting for survival at the bottom of the standings are often unsung heroes who battle on alone after burying themselves working for more favoured teammates or who are battling on through injury. An award acknowledging last place (and the potential fight for it) would shine a light on the more human side of the sport, bringing some recognition for those who spend their careers in the service of others and providing a means of exposure for teams and riders without them needing to win – which is appropriate in this era of superstars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take Lawson Craddock at the 2018 Tour de France. The American crashed on the race’s opening stage and fractured his shoulder blade, but continued racing and pledged to donate $100 for every stage he finished to help rebuild the velodrome in his home town of Houston, Texas, which had been damaged by Hurricane Harvey. Craddock not only became the first man in history to finish every stage as the <em>lanterne rouge</em>, the exposure generated over $250,000 in donations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Giro d’Italia is clearly trying to find new elements to spice up the racing with ideas like the new Red Bull KM and the ‘Intergiro’ that preceded it, but the return of the <em>maglia nera</em> would provide an extra injection of interest and new stories to tell.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>The origins of the black jersey</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"219\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/giuseppe-ticozzelli-on-bike.webp\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Giuseppe Ticozzelli</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The <em>maglia nera</em> – the black jersey – was actually created thanks to football player Giuseppe Ticozzelli, a defender who played for three top division clubs in Italy from 1914 to 1931. Ticozzelli was also a keen cyclist, and in 1926 he rode in the Giro d’Italia as an independent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time he was playing for Casale, whose kit was black with a white star on the chest, so he decided to wear a black kit for the Giro. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the race, Ticozzelli actually gained an hour on the main group early on, but with no support team he was forced to take long breaks to find food to refuel. He was ultimately forced to abandon on Stage 4 after being hit by a motorbike, and twenty years later organisers decided to introduce the <em>maglia nera</em> in recognition of Ticozzelli’s efforts. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"343\" height=\"472\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/luigi-malabrocca-21b962.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/luigi-malabrocca-21b962.webp 343w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/luigi-malabrocca-21b962-218x300.webp 218w\" /><figcaption>Luigi Malabrocca</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>At the end of each stage, the rider wearing the black jersey won money as well as food and drink, and a rivalry even emerged in the fight for last place and the prize that came with it. The duels between Luigi Malabrocca and Sante Carolo were intense; they would do anything possible to be the last man on GC, including sabotaging themselves, hiding in barns and hanging out with fans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malabrocca came out on top – or should that be bottom? – on the first two opportunities in 1946 and 1947, while Carolo only won the jersey once. That was in 1949 when, annoyed by Malabrocca’s antics, the course judges had already left by the time he rolled in on the final stage over two and a half hours down and so awarded him the same time as the main peloton. As a result, he would finish the Giro in second-to-last place, ahead of Carolo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly given such events, the Giro would drop black jersey after 1951, with Giovanni Pinarello – yes, the founder of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pinarello-classic-bikes-gallery\">Pinarello bikes</a> – the last rider to win it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the jersey itself hasn’t appeared again since, the concept was brought back in 2008 as just a black number. For the record, it was ‘won’ by Milram’s Markus Eichler, who finished over four and a half hours down on winner Alberto Contador.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+3\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the best rides, bikes, kit and pro interviews every month, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>In the black</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are obviously good reasons as to why the <em>maglia nera </em>only lasted six editions, and probably plenty more that might apply in the modern pro racing environment, but there are steps the race organisers could take to get around at least some of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, the lengths those pioneers would go to in order to win the jersey simply wouldn’t be allowed in 2025. Riders wouldn’t be able to hide in bars and cafes, and the sabotaging of equipment would be off the table. Most importantly of all, however, riders would still be required to finish each stage within the day’s time limit to avoid getting kicked out of the race altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more difficult problem to solve is the potential for riders choosing to continue going through injury. Like Craddock at the Tour de France, there are some examples of riders fighting through serious pain for a good cause, but the safety of the rider – both short and long term – would have to be prioritised. If there were to be an actual reward for finishing last, it could blur the lines between when it is safe to ride, and when it isn’t. However, this too could be addressed relatively easily: simply make it a requirement for riders to be pronounced fit by an independent race doctor before they’re able to race.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/combination-jersey\">Does the combination jersey at the Tour de France have a place in modern cycling?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-why-jersey-pink\">The fascinating history of the maglia rosa</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/lanterne-rouge-at-the-tour-de-france\">Lanterne Rouge at the Tour de France</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Once you go black</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"764\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/giovannipinarello-a49c46.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/giovannipinarello-a49c46.webp 764w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/giovannipinarello-a49c46-229x300.webp 229w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/giovannipinarello-a49c46-741x970.webp 741w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/giovannipinarello-a49c46-750x982.webp 750w\" /><figcaption>Giovanni ‘Nani’ Pinarello in the <em>maglia nera </em>in 1951.</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I love underdog stories. I like knowing who is at the foot of the standings and discovering why they’re in such a position. Their stories matter just as much as those of the riders fighting to win the <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-why-jersey-pink\">maglia rosa</a></em>, only theirs mostly go unheard of, especially in the case of riders who have hit the wall and emptied themselves of every last bit of energy just to give their team leaders that tiny fraction more of a chance to take a victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The black jersey would bring an extra point of interest to the Giro, it would be another jersey for the organisers to get sponsorship money for and could bring unique entertainment to the race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So bring back the <em>maglia nera</em> and show the other side of bike racing. The less glamorous but equally important one at the bottom of the rankings. After all, there are no ‘losers’ in cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-970x332.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'stay one step ahead of the pack, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-970x332.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-300x103.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-768x263.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-1536x526.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-2048x701.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-750x257.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-1140x390.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/maglia-nera-giro-ditalia\">Opinion: Bring back the maglia nera at the Giro d’Italia</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"a9d2f39be7718129a6dd9673554823d6541fbca85afe357381a57393618e5da2","category":"Cycling"}
