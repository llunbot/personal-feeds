{"title":"The Pricing Stability of the iMac","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/04/the-pinnacle-of-apples-price-stability-is-the-imac/","date":1743891390000,"content":"\n<p>Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In his piece, Gruber particularly calls out the trashcan Mac Pro\nsticking at $2999 throughout its existence, but I think an even\nmore striking example is the iMac. Introduced in 1998 at a base\nprice of $1299, today’s infinitely more powerful iMac M4 starts at\n… $1299.</p>\n\n<p>Granted, with inflation, those prices would be a little different.\nIn researching the details, I came across <a href=\"https://www.perfectrec.com/posts/iMac-price-history\">this great piece from\nPerfectRec</a> charting the iMac’s price history over the years,\nincluding adjusting for inflation. Impressively, while the iMac’s\nbase price has dipped as low as $1099 in all that time, it’s never\ngone <em>over</em> $1299.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a great example. And bringing inflation into the mix is a key factor I neglected to make <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/unchanging_prices_vs_nonsensical_tariffs\">yesterday</a>. Moore’s Law makes computers very strange manufactured goods. A Honda Civic LX cost about $15,000 in 1998, but now costs about $25,000. BMW 3-series sedans went from around $30,000 to $45,000. But the iMac still starts at $1,299.</p>\n\n<p>Pricing stability is a way that Apple keeps these two forces — Moore’s Law and inflation — in balance.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/05/the-pricing-stability-of-the-imac\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"01d33c2792047b468d907c87a6bff2a473ffa2dad305320237074cc8d638e19c","category":"Tech"}
