After a nearly three-month investigation, ULA engineers determined the upper stage already mounted to the first flight-rated Vulcan rocket inside a hangar in Florida needs more work.</p>\n<p>ULA hasn’t ruled out launching the company’s first new Vulcan rocket by the end of the year, but the recovery from the test stand explosion in March eliminated any chance of getting Vulcan off the ground this summer. This also means the Vulcan rocket won’t become operational for the US military until some time next year, following two “certification” flights to demonstrate the vehicle’s performance and reliability.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950667#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950667&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e3db049c57f9dd0401636046d3d03a646a731b71ac98d83f13253cb9c36a3cf4","category":"Tech"}
