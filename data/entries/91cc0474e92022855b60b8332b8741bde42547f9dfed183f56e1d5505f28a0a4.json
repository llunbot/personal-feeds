In 2020, four of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/06/publishers-sue-internet-archive-over-massive-digital-lending-program/\">wealthiest book publishers sued</a> IA, alleging this kind of digital lending was actually “willful digital piracy” causing them “massive harm.” But IA’s lawyer, Joseph Gratz, argued that the Open Library’s digitization of physical books is fair use, and publishers have yet to show they’ve been harmed by IA’s digital lending.</p>\n<p>“There’s no evidence that the publishers have lost a dime,” Gratz said during oral arguments at a New York district court.</p>\n<p>It’s up to a federal judge, John Koeltl, to decide if IA’s digital lending constitutes copyright infringement. During oral arguments, Koeltl’s tough questioning of both Gratz and the plaintiff’s attorney, Elizabeth McNamara, suggested that resolving this matter is a less straightforward task than either side has so far indicated. Koeltl pointed out that because publishers have a right to control the reproduction of their books, the “heart of the case,” was figuring out whether IA’s book scanning violates copyrights by reproducing an already licensed physical book and lending it without paying more licensing fees to publishers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925368#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925368&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"91cc0474e92022855b60b8332b8741bde42547f9dfed183f56e1d5505f28a0a4","category":"Tech"}
