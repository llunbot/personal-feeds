When you’ve got enough hardware in the world, you just can’t catch <em>everything</em>. Some of those bugs have been big enough that we recommend users <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/357166/ios-15-update-right-away-or-wait.html\">wait to upgrade to iOS 15</a> until a few of them are fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We might have to rethink that recommendation now that iOS 15.0.1 is out. It fixes three of the more commonplace problems, including the frustrating <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/538845/iphone-13-unlock-with-apple-watch-unable-to-communicate.html\">Unlock with Apple Watch bug</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Release notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The release notes for iOS 15.0.1 are quite short. Essentially, this release fixes three known iOS 15 bugs:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><em>This update includes bug fixes for your iPhone.</em><br /><em>– Unlock iPhone with Apple Watch may not work on iPhone 13 models</em><br /><em>– Settings app may incorrectly display an alert that storage is full</em><br /><em>– Audio meditations could unexpectedly start a workout on Apple Watch for some Fitness+ subscribers</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get iOS 15.0.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You get iOS 15.0.1 the way you get any iOS update:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Open the <em>Settings</em> app</li><li>Tap <em>General</em></li><li>Tap <em>Software Update</em></li></ul><p>When you see the update listed, choose Download and Install and follow the instructions. Your iPhone will have to restart.</p>\n</div>","author":"Jason Cross","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"42444cf8142944fd08d5a9ea4a5a9b3cdd801fc3bb4011d626dca07dc2795854","category":"Apple"}
