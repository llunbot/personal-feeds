Apple CEO Tim Cook said there was \"strong demand\" for the M1 MacBook Air in particular.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/ipad-mac-side-by-side.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nNo new Macs were released during the quarter, with the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models not being released until after the quarter ended, but Mac sales have been strong due to a work-from-home environment and as a result of Apple's successful transition to its own custom-designed chips in Macs, starting with the M1 chip last year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's financial chief Luca Maestri said the company's last five quarters for Mac revenue have been its best five quarters ever for the category.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\niPad revenue was $8.25 billion for the quarter, which was not a record, but up 21% from $6.79 billion in the year-ago quarter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\niPad sales were likely boosted by the launch of the redesigned sixth-generation iPad mini and the ninth-generation lower-cost iPad during the quarter, while iPads remain popular as many people continue to work, learn, and connect with others from home.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMaestri said iPad supply was significantly constrained during the September quarter and Apple expects iPad revenue to decline on a year-over-year basis in the December quarter as a result of continued supply constraints. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple reported <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/28/apple-4q-2021-earnings/\">overall revenue of $83.4 billion</a> for the quarter, which ran from late June through late September of this year.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/\">earnings</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/28/mac-revenue-record-q4-2021/\">Apple Reports All-Time Quarterly Revenue Record for Macs With 'Strong Demand' for M1 MacBook Air</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reports-all-time-quarterly-revenue-record-for-macs-with-strong-demand-for-m1-macbook-air.2320350/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UCvVMa5jXSM:kYNEzaWaGOQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UCvVMa5jXSM:kYNEzaWaGOQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/UCvVMa5jXSM\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"de86b8013c33d5f50be0e4ddea9212d6997ea73652ea719dd0bb406e45198a78","category":"Apple"}
