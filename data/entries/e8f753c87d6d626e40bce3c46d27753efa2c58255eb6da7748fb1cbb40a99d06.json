Similar to the Mac Studio, Gurman said two of the ports will be located on the front of the new Mac mini. Technically speaking, at least some of these ports will likely be Thunderbolt 4 ports, which use the USB-C connector design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe exact string is \"Apple silicon Mac mini (5 Port).\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman expects the Mac mini to receive its first major redesign since 2010 this year. He said the new model will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/mac-mini-to-become-smallest-ever-apple-computer/\">nearly as small as an Apple TV</a>, feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/15/m4-macs-and-new-ipads-at-next-apple-event/\">M4 and M4 Pro chip options</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/01/mac-mini-to-lose-usb-a-ports-later-this-year/\">lack the USB-A ports</a> included on previous models. The current Mac mini was released in January 2023 and has four Thunderbolt 4 ports and two USB-A ports, along with an HDMI port, Gigabit Ethernet port, and a headphone jack.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe next Mac mini is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/15/m4-macs-and-new-ipads-at-next-apple-event/\">rumored to be announced at Apple's next event in October</a>, alongside some other M4 Macs and a new iPad mini.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOur image above is merely a mockup of what a smaller Mac mini might look like.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/16/mac-mini-5-usb-c-ports-leak/\">Apple Leaks New Mac Mini With 5 USB-C Ports</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-leaks-new-mac-mini-with-5-usb-c-ports.2436514/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e8f753c87d6d626e40bce3c46d27753efa2c58255eb6da7748fb1cbb40a99d06","category":"Apple"}
