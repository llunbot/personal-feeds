However, if you want to be competitive, a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/time-trial-bikes/\">time-trial bike</a> is a must.</p>\n<p>To address this, the CTT (Cycling Time Trials, the UK’s time trial governing body) introduced an official road bike category in 2022 in a bid to make time trialling “an every person’s sport”.</p>\n<p>The move sees results split by road and time trial bike classifications in open club events, with the season culminating in separate national championship events.</p>\n<p>There are, of course, rules that define what makes a ‘road bike’ in the eyes of the CTT.</p>\n<p>To start, bikes must have drop or flat bars, which means clip-on extensions or tri bars aren’t permitted. Wheels can also be no deeper than 90mm and must have at least 12 spokes, so disc wheels are off the cards.</p>\n\n<p>The 2023 National Road Bike Championships took place on Sunday (1 October) on a rolling 18-mile (29km) course north of Marshfield, in the south-west of England.</p>\n<p>With 180 riders on the start sheet, the general consensus was that the introduction of the road bike category is a welcome one, with promoters FTP Racing surprised by the size of the field.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n
