It uses motion graphics to accentuate the content of phone calls surrounding a supernatural event.<blockquote>\"The work of this motion design team was innovative and original and truly carried the narrative like nothing we had ever seen,\" said Greg Kupiec, motion and title design governor. \"This Emmy-winning work encourages others to continue raising the standard of motion design and to bring awareness of the art and significance of motion design in creating television excellence,\" added Governor Lauraine Gibbons.</blockquote>The awards will be presented at the 2021 Creative Arts Emmy Awards, set to take place at L.A. Live on the weekend of September 11 and September 12. Juried awards like these are decided on by a panel of professionals in the appropriate peer groups.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/apple-tv-plus-calls-for-all-mankind-emmys/\">Apple TV+ Shows 'For All Mankind' and 'Calls' Win Emmy Awards</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-shows-for-all-mankind-and-calls-win-emmy-awards.2308654/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pdRA_IBS-s4:xzvGMiAtoJQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pdRA_IBS-s4:xzvGMiAtoJQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/pdRA_IBS-s4\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7e8b6983a4f696aab022068db75f7ffe697cd3cfdc12caa7b2ef8331c95fcded","category":"Apple"}
