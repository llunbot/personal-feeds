It includes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@DesFit\">DesFit</a>, Dave of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ChaseTheSummit\">Chase The Summit</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@mlegrand\">Matt Legrand</a>.</p>\n<p>When we met up in California ahead of the event, Matt casually mentioned that he had spent “a couple minutes” putting together this game, if we were up for it. The premise of the game was a bunch of super close-up shots of watches (called “macro” shots in photography terms), and then attempt to identify them. These would be very very very close-up, like, the threads of a band. Or the finishes around the outside of a bezel.</p>\n<p>It turns out when he says “a couple minutes” he means like a day of filming with fancy automated sliders, expensive camera lenses, and finely tuned fancy lights. Whereas when the rest of us say “a couple minutes”, we mean we did something for 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>In any event, late that Tuesday night we re-arranged the deserted courtyard of our collective hotel into a film studio. This includes extra iPhones placed in the trees to provide light on the table, via the flashlight (fun tidbit: about an hour later I realized I left mine still in the tree…it was still happily there shining brightly on the unused hot tub area.)</p>\n<p>From there, the master of ceremonies, Matt Legrand, introduced us to the game – which did involve me being blindfolded at one point. Next to a hot tub. With alcohol. Basically, this was one step away from a bad spring break video.</p>\n<p>In any case, go give it a watch (above) – it’s lots of fun! And don’t worry, back to boatloads of reviews later this week – things be getting crazy shortly. Also, next year, I’m gonna do some studying. Just me, sitting in my storage room with a magnifying glass working carefully inspecting watch bezel finishes.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"f1117026ab8e0e10da9a42753600e7c2bef414d79ce4981231e91bfd308283a9","category":"Cycling"}
