For the first time in more than a decade, the US space agency is grappling with budget cuts. Be forewarned, there will be a lot of numbers in this story, but we'll do our best to make sense of them.</p>\n<p>First of all, the space agency only just received its budget for the current fiscal year (October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024) last Friday. If it seems weird that a federal agency should find out how much money it has to spend nearly halfway through that budget year, well, it is. But this is the world we live in, with a fractious Congress unable to agree on much of anything, including budgets.</p>\n<p>In any case, NASA's budget for fiscal year 2024 came to $24.9 billion. This represents an approximately 2 percent cut in the space agency's funding relative to the final budget for fiscal year 2023. It's worth noting that the last time NASA's budget decreased from year to year came more than a decade ago, from fiscal year 2012 to 2013. This was due, in large part, to the end of the Space Shuttle program.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009351#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009351&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8fc4cf3e783e97725eb1f839769c94ee43d439633354163947b9803792dc0e1d","category":"Tech"}
