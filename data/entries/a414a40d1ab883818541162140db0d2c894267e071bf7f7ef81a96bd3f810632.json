Teams working on the project were \"slowed by technical challenges, poor communication and managers split over the wisdom of trying to design the chips rather than buy them.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrom the report:\r<br />\n<blockquote>Apple had planned to have its modem chip ready to use in the new iPhone models. But tests late last year found the chip was too slow and prone to overheating. Its circuit board was so big it would take up half an iPhone, making it unusable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTeams were siloed in separate groups across the U.S. and abroad without a global leader. Some managers discouraged the airing of bad news about delays or setbacks from engineers, leading to unrealistic goals and blown deadlines.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Just because Apple builds the best silicon on the planet, it's ridiculous to think that they could also build a modem,\" said former Apple wireless director Jaydeep Ranade, who left the company in 2018, the year the project began.</blockquote>Apple's ability to design its own microprocessors for iPhones and iPads reportedly caused the company to think it could build modem chips. However, such chips transmit and receive wireless data from various types of wireless networks, and must comply with strict connectivity standards to serve wireless carriers around the world, making them a significantly more challenging undertaking.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nExecutives reportedly better understood the challenge after Apple tested its prototypes late last year. The results weren't good, according to people familiar with the tests who spoke to <em>WSJ</em>. The chip was too slow and prone to overheating, while its circuit board was so big it would take up half an iPhone, making it unusable. The chips were \"essentially three years behind Qualcomm's best modem chip,\" and using them threatened to make iPhone wireless speeds slower than its competitors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple was forced to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/\">settle its lawsuit</a> with Qualcomm and has since used Qualcomm 5G modem chips for its latest ‌iPhone‌ and iPad lineups. As it stands, 2025 may be the soonest that the technology is finally advanced enough for Apple to phase out Qualcomm, according to the report's sources. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"These delays indicate Apple didn't anticipate the complexity of the effort,\" said Serge Willenegger, a former longtime Qualcomm executive who spoke to <em>WSJ</em>. \"Cellular is a monster.\" Underlining the significance of Apple's setback, the company last week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/11/apple-extends-deal-with-qualcomm-as-modem-delayed/\">extended</a> its agreement to obtain modems from Qualcomm for three more years.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/\">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/\">Qualcomm</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-vs-qualcomm/\">Apple vs. Qualcomm</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/\">Apple 5G Modem</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apple-wsj-5gm-modem-project-challenges/\">WSJ: Apple's 5G Modem Prototypes 'Three Years Behind Qualcomm's Best Chip'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wsj-apples-5g-modem-prototypes-three-years-behind-qualcomms-best-chip.2403600/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a414a40d1ab883818541162140db0d2c894267e071bf7f7ef81a96bd3f810632","category":"Apple"}
