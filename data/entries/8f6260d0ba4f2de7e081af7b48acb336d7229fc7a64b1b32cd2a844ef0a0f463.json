There are references to a waitlist, with specific strings that say \"Join the Graymatter Waiting List\" and \"Joined Waitlist.\" There is also wording that refers to it as a \"limited preview.\"\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"While Graymatter is in limited preview, you may experience unusually slow responses when not in a supported region.\"</blockquote>\r<br />\nApple plans to introduce Apple Intelligence during the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-ios-18-beta/\">iOS 18 beta testing period</a> this summer, so the limited preview and waitlist may be something that Apple will use during the beta testing period.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is possible, however, that there will be a waitlist when Apple Intelligence launches publicly in ‌iOS 18‌ given some of the issues that other AI services like ChatGPT have experienced at times due to demand. While <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users will need an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or later to access Apple Intelligence, it will also be available on all <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models, which will launch with ‌iOS 18‌ installed, increasing the number of people using the feature at launch.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-apple-intelligence-limited-preview/\">iOS 18 Apple Intelligence Feature Will Have Waitlist During Initial 'Limited Preview'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-apple-intelligence-feature-will-have-waitlist-during-initial-limited-preview.2428769/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8f6260d0ba4f2de7e081af7b48acb336d7229fc7a64b1b32cd2a844ef0a0f463","category":"Apple"}
