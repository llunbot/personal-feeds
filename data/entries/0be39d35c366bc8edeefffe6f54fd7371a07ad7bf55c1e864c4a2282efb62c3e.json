Cisco included a <a href=\"https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/IOCs/blob/main/2024/04/large-scale-brute-force-activity-targeting-vpns-ssh-services-with-commonly-used-login-credentials.txt\">list</a> of more than 2,000 usernames and almost 100 passwords used in the attacks, along with nearly 4,000 IP addresses sending the login traffic. The IP addresses appear to originate from TOR exit nodes and other anonymizing tunnels and proxies. The attacks appear to be indiscriminate and opportunistic rather than aimed at a particular region or industry.</p>\n<p>“Depending on the target environment, successful attacks of this type may lead to unauthorized network access, account lockouts, or denial-of-service conditions,” Talos researchers <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/large-scale-brute-force-activity-targeting-vpns-ssh-services-with-commonly-used-login-credentials/\">wrote Tuesday</a>. “The traffic related to these attacks has increased with time and is likely to continue to rise.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017646#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017646&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0be39d35c366bc8edeefffe6f54fd7371a07ad7bf55c1e864c4a2282efb62c3e","category":"Tech"}
