After a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/segway-ebike-team-dealer-centric-sales-model-two-new-ebikes/\" target=\"_blank\">slow tease building up to the release of their two debut models</a>, the Xyber and the Xafari, the infamous brand unveiled the details at CES. Both are full suspension, all-terrain ebikes but the two models offer the choice between a conventional looking step-through ebike or a super powerful moto-inspired bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Segway says their ebikes aim to make riding easier, more fun, safer, more convenient and more accessible to more people. Ironically, the Xyber is a massively powerful ebike that’s not street legal, so it’s not very convenient and potentially quite dangerous. However, the Xafari is a more reasonable option that is accessible, and conveniently legal wherever Class 2 bikes can be ridden.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Segway Xyber:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-side.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-side.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xyber, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-side.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-side-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-side-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-side-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-side-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-side-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Xyber has, in Segways words, a “futuristic, moto-inspired aesthetic”. The brand describes it as a mid-range light electric vehicle (LEV), as it does have a full throttle and can get you pretty far, pretty fast. That is, as long as you’re not using any actual road… or don’t care about breaking laws!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before going any further, it’s important to note that this ebike is considered ‘unclassified’ by Segway. It is apparently not intended for on-road use, “or where prohibited”! Perhaps Segway built it simply to showcase the power and electronic gadgets they could offer? More sensibly, Segway does plan to release a second version of the Xyber that will conform to Class 2 ebike requirements. That model should be announced in late spring or early summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Xyber is built around a cast aluminum double-cradle frame. It is a full suspension ebike with a coil-sprung, hydraulically damped inverted fork and rear swingarm. Front travel is 110mm and rear travel is 100mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-wheel.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-wheel.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xyber, front wheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-wheel.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-wheel-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-wheel-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-wheel-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-wheel-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-wheel-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Xyber rolls on 20 x 5.0” multi-surface tires with flat-resistant inserts. Braking is handled by Tektro, with 4-piston front and 2-piston rear hydraulic disc brakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s hope those brakes are up to the task of reeling in the Xyber, as it weighs a whopping 146lbs! With its powerful motor and dual batteries (which hopefully never run out mid-ride), the Xyber can haul a payload of 408lbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Powertrain and Electronics:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-batteries.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-batteries.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xyber, batteries\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-batteries.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-batteries-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-batteries-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-batteries-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-batteries-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-batteries-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Xyber offers serious power output, with it’s direct-drive motor putting out 175Nm of torque and 6000W max. Please note those numbers are only possible with the dual battery Xyber. There will be a single battery version of the bike, but specs were not provided for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Xyber’s dual batteries provide 2880Wh of capacity, allowing a range up to 112 miles. A smart battery management system ensures optimal range. The Xyber’s batteries take four hours to charge, and the batteries and display unit are protected to IPX7 water resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-display-bars.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-display-bars.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xyber, display, handlebars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-display-bars.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-display-bars-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-display-bars-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-display-bars-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-display-bars-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-display-bars-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Xyber offers 12 levels of pedal assist, plus a full throttle option. There are three throttle-only modes: Eco, Sport and Race. In Race Mode (and with dual batteries) the Xyber can accelerate from 0-20mph in 2.7 seconds! Max speed is currently listed at 35mph, but Segway notes this number may change before final production. They also note the max speed can be limited to 20mph via their app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 2.4” TFT multi-function color display screen shows your navigation, ride metrics, etc. and automatically adjusts its brightness as you cruise around. The display unit can connect to your phone to hold or reject calls, or control your phone’s music player so you can listen to tunes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-scroll-wheel.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"799\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-scroll-wheel.webp\" alt=\"Segway scroll wheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-scroll-wheel.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-scroll-wheel-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-scroll-wheel-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-scroll-wheel-768x511.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-scroll-wheel-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-scroll-wheel-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Segway created a handlebar-mounted multi-function scroll wheel to navigate through assist levels and display screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-end.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-end.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xyber, front end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-end.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-end-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-end-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-end-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-end-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-front-end-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Segway includes their Intelligent Lighting System on the Xyber. The system includes an integrated 1300 lumen auto-headlight and tail lights. The headlight offers high and low beams, plus a daytime running light. A USB port on the bike allows you to charge mobile devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Segway Intelligent Ride System:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-guy-approaching.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-guy-approaching.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xyber, man approaching\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-guy-approaching.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-guy-approaching-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-guy-approaching-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-guy-approaching-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-guy-approaching-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xyber-guy-approaching-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the Xyber and Xafari include Segway’s Intelligent Ride System, which is a suite of smart technology and features (as listed below).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Airlock:</strong> A wireless security system that engages mechanical locks and shuts down system access when you walk away from the bike, and unlocks the bike when you return. A built-in alarm will sound if someone moves the bike when locked, and the tone gets louder until it is deactivated. The app also sends a notification to your phone to let you know your bike has been disturbed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple FindMy + Segway GPS tracking:</strong> Dual-component tracking with high-frequency location refresh makes it easy to locate your bike at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-phone-display.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-phone-display.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xafari, phone, display\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-phone-display.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-phone-display-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-phone-display-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-phone-display-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-phone-display-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-phone-display-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Segway IOT integration:</strong> Assists with GPS monitoring, allows for app control of the bike, over the air updates, and maintenance reminders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Health/Fitness app syncing:</strong> Connects your ebike to Apple and Android mobile health apps and Segway’s Mobility app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adaptive Pedal Assist:</strong> Uses sensors on the bike and an algorithm to automatically adjust pedal assist output as you ride, based on slope angle, terrain and rider input.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Segway Xafari:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-side.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-side.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xafari, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-side.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-side-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-side-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-side-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-side-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-side-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Xafari features something we don’t see too often: A step-though frame that offers 70mms of rear suspension with adjustable preload and compression damping. The Xafari’s 80mm suspension fork includes a lockout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Xafari is a certified Class 2 ebike, you can ride it without breaking any laws! Segway notes the classification, acceleration and top speed are subject to federal, state and local regulations. That said, the bike can be configured to fit into Class 1, 2 or 3 by using Segway’s app. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-man-woman.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-man-woman.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xafari, man and woman\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-man-woman.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-man-woman-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-man-woman-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-man-woman-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-man-woman-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-man-woman-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The “all-terrain electric cruiser” Xafari rides on 26 x 3.0” all-terrain tires, and provides upright, comfortable frame geometry. A quick-release seat clamp allows easy saddle height adjustment, so Segway says this bike will fit riders from 5’1” to 6’2”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Xafari gets a pair of Tektro 2-piston hydraulic brakes. This model gets the same Intelligent Lighting System as the Xyber, with a 1300 lumen auto-headlight with high/low beams, daytime running light, and tail lights.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-rear-angle.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-rear-angle.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xafari, rear angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-rear-angle.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-rear-angle-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-rear-angle-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-rear-angle-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-rear-angle-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-rear-angle-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To help haul cargo, the Xafari includes a rear rack as well as in-frame storage. Hard and softshell in-frame bags are included with the bike to organize and protect your ride essentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Xafari weighs 85lbs, and can carry a maximum of 395lbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Powertrain and Electronics:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-woman-riding.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-woman-riding.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xafari, woman riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-woman-riding.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-woman-riding-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-woman-riding-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-woman-riding-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-woman-riding-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-woman-riding-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While it doesn’t match the Xyber, the Xafari’s motor outputs a more typical 80Nm max torque and 750W of power. The Xafari can accelerate from 0-20mph in 5.2 seconds. Since this model is compliant with Class 2 requirements (in that setting), its top assist speed is limited to 20mph. Like the Xyber, the Xafari offers 12 levels of adaptive pedal assist and a throttle mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Power comes from a 936Wh battery, which is removeable for easy indoor charging. That battery (and its smart management system) provides a range up to 88 miles. The Xafari’s battery fully charges in six hours, and the display and battery are IPX7 water resistant.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-charging-phone.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-charging-phone.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xafari, charging phone\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-charging-phone.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-charging-phone-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-charging-phone-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-charging-phone-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-charging-phone-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Segway-Xafari-charging-phone-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to all the Intelligent Ride System features listed above, the Xafari shares a few other features with the Xyber. It has a similar 2.4” display with Segway’s scroll wheel to control functions. It also gets an integrated 20W USB A/C port to charge devices while you ride.
