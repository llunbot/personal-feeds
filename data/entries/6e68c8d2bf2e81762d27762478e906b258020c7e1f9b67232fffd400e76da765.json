A Netflix spokesperson also confirmed to\n<em>MacRumors</em> that the rollout is underway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When you’re watching a movie on an iPhone or iPad, spatial audio is a  game changer for degree of immersiveness. Henceforth when preloading a movie or two for a plane trip, I’ll favor titles with spatial audio support. It really helps make up for the small screen by having big immersive sound.</p>\n\n<p>Not surprised that Netflix is adding support sooner rather than later — one thing Netflix gets right is they want viewers to be happy. Spatial audio makes me happy.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/18/netflix-spatial-audio\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6e68c8d2bf2e81762d27762478e906b258020c7e1f9b67232fffd400e76da765","category":"Tech"}
