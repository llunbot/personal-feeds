There’s a rumor that it could feature <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2550395/the-macbook-with-a-modem-dream-may-finally-come-true.html\">cellular connectivity</a>, but perhaps more relevant to a wider audience is that the 2026 MacBook Pro could sport an OLED display, according to an <a href=\"https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1864535769668571431\">X post by Jukanlosreve</a>, who got access to an Apple adoption roadmap by industry analyst firm Omdia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “OLED coming to the MacBook Pro” speculation <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2508939/major-changes-are-coming-to-the-macbook-pro-but-not-until-2026.html\">isn’t new</a>, but what is new is that in Omdia’s report, the OLEDs Apple will use are identified as “Hole Cut” screens. That’s a change from current models, which use mini LED “Notch Cut” screens that first appeared in the redesigned 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro. “Hole Cut” seems to indicate that Apple is going to replace the current notch with a centered pinhole for the FaceTime Camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pinhole would allow for more usable pixels in the menu bar, which is currently disrupted by the notch. It would also be less obvious and more aesthetically pleasing and likely match the aesthetic of the iPhone 18, which is rumored to move away from the static pill-shaped cutout. With the move to a pinhole, it seems less likely that Apple will use it as a UI element for Dynamic Island in macOS. It’s not clear whether Apple plans to incorporate a Dynamic Island element into the MacBook’s hole cutout, but it’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1068105/dynamic-island-macbook-pro.html\">something we have wanted</a> since the iPhone 14 Pro arrived. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/julanlosreve-macbook-pro-tweet.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"julanlosreve macbook pro tweet\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/julanlosreve-macbook-pro-tweet.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/julanlosreve-macbook-pro-tweet.jpg?resize=300%2C194&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/julanlosreve-macbook-pro-tweet.jpg?resize=768%2C497&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/julanlosreve-macbook-pro-tweet.jpg?resize=1200%2C776&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/julanlosreve-macbook-pro-tweet.jpg?resize=1536%2C993&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/julanlosreve-macbook-pro-tweet.jpg?resize=2048%2C1324&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"776\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><a href=\"https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1864535769668571431/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\">X/julanlosreve</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Another interesting tidbit from Omdia’s report is that Apple may update the MacBook Air with OLEDs, but not until 2027–and that OLED will continue to have a “Notch Cut,” not the “Hole Cut.” It appears that Apple wants to use the camera notch and hole as a way to further distinguish the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the 2025 MacBook Pro, it’s rumored to get nothing more than an upgrade to the M5 chip series when it becomes available, likely in the fall. Apple is expected to release the M4 MacBook Air in the spring of 2025.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"554fc2e978eacab52a3b5ed768b215bfcfe2dbf8021412a9e0d40a789033df34","category":"Apple"}
