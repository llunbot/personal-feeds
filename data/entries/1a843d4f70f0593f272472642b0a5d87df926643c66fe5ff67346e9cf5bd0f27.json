That's why id Software made <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/06/dumbphone-exclusive-doom-rpg-has-been-reverse-engineered-by-fans/\"><em>Doom RPG</em>, the weirdest official <em>Doom</em> game</a> that is also still a bit fun. A group of fans known as GEC.Inc ported that game to modern PCs, and they've finally gotten around to its sequel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/135602-doom-ii-rpg-port-reverse-engineering-version-01/\"><em>Doom II RPG</em></a>, the iOS version from 2009, is playable the same way <em>Doom RPG</em> was: with an understanding that you, a person in 2023, will somehow have access to the original, potentially still copyrighted assets of the game. The instructions lead you through setting up <a href=\"https://www.openal.org/downloads/\">OpenAL</a>, then loading in an .ipa iOS file (the Internet Archive has a copy). You can use a touchscreen, most modern game controllers, or just your keyboard and mouse. You'll then get to play a <em>Doom II</em> that's not quite like what you're thinking of when you think of <em>Doom II.</em></p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-113238-980x734.png\" alt /></div>\n          <p>\n            Playing <em>Doom</em> without the Doom Guy? The 2000s were a wild time.                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>How does it play? A bit awkwardly, unless you're used to the turn-based, grid-moving, RNG-dominated RPGs of earlier eras. With each turn, you can move in one of four directions, attack with a weapon, or perform some other action, like ripping a toilet fixture off the wall for later throwing (if you're strong enough). If you end up face to face with an imp, there's not much else to do except trade blows, hoping the random hit/miss mechanics are in your favor or that you have enough health packs or snacks to hold out.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937668#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937668&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1a843d4f70f0593f272472642b0a5d87df926643c66fe5ff67346e9cf5bd0f27","category":"Tech"}
