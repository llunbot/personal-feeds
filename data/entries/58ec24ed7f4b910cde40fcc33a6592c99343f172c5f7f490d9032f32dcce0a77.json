{"title":"Juno YouTube App for Vision Pro Removed From App Store","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/juno-vision-pro-removed-app-store/","date":1727818732000,"content":"Juno, an app designed for watching YouTube on the Vision Pro, has been removed from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, developer Christian Selig <a href=\"https://christianselig.com/2024/10/juno-removed/\">said today</a>. Back in April, YouTube emailed Selig and said that Juno was violating the YouTube Terms of Service and the YouTube API by modifying the native YouTube.com web user interface, and used YouTube trademarks and iconography that could be confusing to customers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/juno-removed-from-app-store.jpg\" width=\"1951\" height=\"1097\" />\r<br />\nIn response, Selig switched from using the embed player to the website player, made it clear that Juno was an unofficial YouTube viewer, and explained to YouTube that as a web viewer, Juno is not using YouTube APIs. At the same time, though, YouTube filed a complaint with the ‌App Store‌, and Selig went on to warn customers that he would not fight Google on any decision regarding Juno.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nJuno has now been removed from the ‌App Store‌ by Apple in response to YouTube's complaint. Selig says that he does not agree with the decision because Juno is a simple web view and that that modifies CSS to make the player look more \"visionOS like,\" but he does not plan to appeal the decision.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/juno-1-1-youtube.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nSelig, for those unaware, was the developer of the Reddit app Apollo, and he faced a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/30/apollo-app-shutting-down-today/\">public fight with Reddit</a> over its third-party API changes and fees last year. The dispute ultimately ended up with Apollo shutting down. According to Selig, Juno was just a fun hobby project.\r<br />\n<blockquote>Juno was a fun hobby project for me to build. As a developer I wanted to get some experience building for the Vision Pro, and as a user I wanted a nice way to watch YouTube on this cool new device. As a result, I really enjoyed building Juno, but it was always something I saw as fundamentally a little app I built for fun.</blockquote>\r<br />\nYouTube does not have a dedicated app for the Vision Pro, which is why Selig designed and released Juno <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/juno-app-youtube-apple-vision-pro/\">last February</a>. Prior to when the Vision Pro launched, YouTube said that it would not develop a Vision Pro app, nor would it allow the YouTube <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> app to run on the headset. With Juno removed, those who want to watch YouTube on Vision Pro will need to use Safari.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nJuno for YouTube was priced at $4.99, and Selig says that customers who purchased the app should still be able to use it even though it's been removed from the ‌App Store‌.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/\">visionOS 2</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/\">YouTube</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/juno-vision-pro-removed-app-store/\">Juno YouTube App for Vision Pro Removed From App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/juno-youtube-app-for-vision-pro-removed-from-app-store.2438853/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"58ec24ed7f4b910cde40fcc33a6592c99343f172c5f7f490d9032f32dcce0a77","category":"Apple"}
