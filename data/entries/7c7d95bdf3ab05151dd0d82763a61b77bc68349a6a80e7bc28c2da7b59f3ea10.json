This is how I’m\nstanding up.”</p>\n\n<p>On October 11, Patrick Soon-Shiong, who bought the newspaper for\n$500 million in 2018, informed the paper’s editorial board that\nthe Times would not be making an endorsement for president.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, was like, “Hold my beer...” <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement-president/\">Here’s William Lewis</a>, CEO and publisher of the Post, which Bezos wholly owns:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Washington Post will not be making an endorsement of a\npresidential candidate in this election. Nor in any future\npresidential election. We are returning to our roots of not\nendorsing presidential candidates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/on-the-newspaper-non-endorsements\">only rational explanation</a> for this decision is cowardice on Bezos’s part in the face of Donald Trump’s vindictiveness. Lewis tries, haplessly, to couch this as a return to the Post’s “roots”, hand-wavingly justifying the decision by pointing out that, prior to 1976, the newspaper declined to issue endorsements:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That was strong reasoning, but in 1976 for understandable reasons\nat the time, we changed this long-standing policy and endorsed\nJimmy Carter as president. But we had it right before that, and\nthis is what we are going back to.</p>\n\n<p>We recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including\nas a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of\nanother, or as an abdication of responsibility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s that last one.</p>\n\n<p>The “understandable reasons” for <em>The Washington Fucking Post</em> to endorse Carter in 1976, not delineated by Lewis, were — you know — the crimes of Republican Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, as reported by the Post’s own legendary reporting duo, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Woodward and Bernstein are having none of Lewis’s and Bezos’s bullshit, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement-president/\">issuing a clear condemnation of the decision</a> (which, conspicuously, the Post’s own news desk published):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We respect the traditional independence of the editorial page,\nbut this decision 12 days out from the 2024 presidential election\nignores the Washington Post’s own overwhelming reportorial\nevidence on the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy. Under Jeff\nBezos’s ownership, the Washington Post’s news operation has used\nits abundant resources to rigorously investigate the danger and\ndamage a second Trump presidency could cause to the future of\nAmerican democracy and that makes this decision even more\nsurprising and disappointing, especially this late in the\nelectoral process.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Marty Baron, recently-retired executive editor of the Post, on X, <a href=\"https://x.com/PostBaron/status/1849847940761657353\">minced even fewer words</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is cowardice, with democracy as its casualty.\n<a href=\"https://x.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realdonaldtrump</a> will see this as an invitation to further\nintimidate owner <a href=\"https://x.com/JeffBezos\">@jeffbezos</a> (and others). Disturbing spinelessness\nat an institution famed for courage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A joint column <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/25/post-columnist-no-endorsement-2024-trump-harris/\">signed by 17 <em>current</em> Washington Post columnists</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Washington Post’s decision not to make an endorsement in the\npresidential campaign is a terrible mistake. It represents an\nabandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the\nnewspaper that we love. This is a moment for the institution to be\nmaking clear its commitment to democratic values, the rule of law\nand international alliances, and the threat that Donald Trump\nposes to them — the precise points The Post made in endorsing\nTrump’s opponents in 2016 and 2020. [...] An independent newspaper\nmight someday choose to back away from making presidential\nendorsements. But this isn’t the right moment, when one candidate\nis advocating positions that directly threaten freedom of the\npress and the values of the Constitution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Alexandra Petri — one of those 17 columnists — in a solo column, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/26/washington-post-endorses-kamala-harris-satire/\">mocking the absurdity of Lewis’s justification for the decision</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We as a newspaper suddenly remembered, less than two weeks before\nthe election, that we had a robust tradition 50 years ago of not\ntelling anyone what to do with their vote for president. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4\">It is\ntime we got back to those “roots,” I’m told!</a></p>\n\n<p>Roots are important, of course. As recently as the 1970s, The Post\ndid not endorse a candidate for president. As recently as\ncenturies ago, there *was *no Post and the country had a king! Go\neven further back, and the entire continent of North America was\ntotally uninhabitable, and we were all spineless creatures who\nlived in the ocean, and certainly there were no Post subscribers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Garza, the editor who resigned in protest from the LA Times, made clear in her interview with CJR that the point of newspaper endorsements is not based on the premise that they sway elections:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“I didn’t think we were going to change our readers’ minds — our\nreaders, for the most part, are Harris supporters,” Garza told\nme. “We’re a very liberal paper. I didn’t think we were going to\nchange the outcome of the election in California. But two things\nconcern me: This is a point in time where you speak your\nconscience no matter what. And an endorsement was the logical\nnext step after a series of editorials we’ve been writing about\nhow dangerous Trump is to democracy, about his unfitness to be\npresident, about his threats to jail his enemies. We have made\nthe case in editorial after editorial that he shouldn’t be\nreelected. [...]”</p>\n\n<p>“And it’s perplexing to readers, and possibly suspicious, that we\ndidn’t endorse her this time.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Chan, the CJR writer Garza spoke to, <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/los-angeles-times-editorials-editor-resigns-after-owner-blocks-presidential-endorsement.php\">continues</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Indeed, hours after Semafor reported on Tuesday that Soon-Shiong\nhad blocked the endorsement, former president Donald Trump’s\nrapid-response team sent out an email calling the newspaper’s\ndecision “the latest blow” for Harris.</p>\n\n<p>“In Kamala’s own home state, the Los Angeles Times — the state’s\nlargest newspaper — has declined to endorse the Harris-Walz\nticket, despite endorsing the Democrat nominees in every election\nfor decades,” the campaign said. “Even her fellow Californians\nknow she’s not up for the job. The Times previously endorsed\nKamala in her 2010 and 2014 races for California attorney general,\nas well as her 2016 race for US Senate — but not this time.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What’s so maddeningly disingenuous about this is that it’s not “the newspapers” that refused to endorse Harris. It was their cowardly owners. Both newspapers had <em>already written</em> their Harris endorsements. Liberal newspapers breaking tradition to not endorse anyone is <em>worse</em> than if their owners had forced them to endorse Trump instead. A Trump endorsement from the LA Times or Washington Post would be absurd. No one, not even the derpiest of MAGA trolls, would believe that. It would be like a steakhouse endorsing veganism. But refusing to endorse Harris? That, on the surface, is plausibly suspicious.</p>\n\n<p>Before this week, I’d never heard of Patrick Soon-Shiong, the LA Times’s owner. I just assume now he’s a self-interested idiot. But Jeff Bezos turning coward surprises me. I didn’t have Bezos pegged as a chickenshit. What’s the point of having so much “fuck you” money if you’re afraid to tell a petty tyrant like Donald Trump to pound sand? And Bezos is smart, really smart, which makes it baffling that he thinks Trump, if elected, might remember this craven gesture of abject subservience, and decline to lash out against Amazon, Blue Origin, or Bezos personally, after a single negative news story in The Washington Post. Transactions work only one way with Donald Trump. Toward him. Only going on stage with Trump and <a href=\"https://x.com/therecount/status/1848815517919789212\">dancing like a dipshit</a> might actually gain <em>derp Führer</em>’s favor.</p>\n\n<p>Jonathan Last, writing at The Bulwark, “<a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/bezos-kills-washington-post-endorsement-guardrails-falling\">The Guardrails Are Already Crumpling</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These guys can hear the music. They’ve seen the sides being\nchosen: Elon Musk and Peter Theil assembling with Trump’s gangster\ngovernment in waiting. They see Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE7SyQWf4_U\">praising Trump as\na “badass</a>.” And now they see Bezos getting in line, too.</p>\n\n<p>What’s remarkable is that Trump didn’t have to arrest Bezos to\nsecure his compliance. Trump didn’t even have to win the election.\nJust the fact that he has an even-money chance to become president\nwas threat enough.</p>\n\n<p>Or maybe that’s not remarkable. One of Timothy Snyder’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Twenty-Lessons-Twentieth-Century/dp/0804190119/?tag=bulwark08-20\">rules for\nresisting authoritarians</a> is that “most of the power of\nauthoritarianism is freely given.” People surrender preemptively\nmuch more often than you might expect.</p>\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, Ian Bassin and Maximillian Potter wrote what might\nbe the most prophetic essay of the year. They warned about\n<a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/analysis/anticipatory-obedience-bassin-potter-scheppele-orban-trump-hungary-media-punish.php\">“anticipatory obedience”</a> in the media.</p>\n\n<p>Seventeen days later, Bezos made his demonstration.</p>\n\n<p>In case you needed reminding: The “guardrails” aren’t <em>guardrails</em>.\nThey’re people.</p>\n\n<p>And they’re already collapsing. Before a single state has\nbeen called.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is no time to get squishy. I have never once unsubscribed from a newspaper in protest, and I certainly haven’t encouraged you to. But there’s a line for everything, and this abject cowardice, in the face of the greatest threat to our democracy itself since the Civil War, crossed that line. I’ve been a paying subscriber to The Washington Post for many years. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/10/washington-post-cancellation.png\">Not anymore</a>. I recommend you do the same.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7c7d95bdf3ab05151dd0d82763a61b77bc68349a6a80e7bc28c2da7b59f3ea10","category":"Tech"}
