It is also the world's most expensive commercially produced rocket, a fact driven not just by its outsize capability but also its complexity.</p>\n<p>Now, United Launch Alliance's last Delta IV Heavy rocket is set to lift off Thursday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, with a classified payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, the US government's spy satellite agency.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012923#p3\">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012923&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2491b7c1b30bd1c16cb8cee2f9985fc57261922435d91d8c7de47ae0d2fbd3c5","category":"Tech"}
