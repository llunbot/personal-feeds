Sources familiar \nwith Microsoft’s plans tell The Verge that Microsoft is \nconfident that a round of new Arm-powered Windows laptops will \nbeat Apple’s M3-powered MacBook Air both in CPU performance and \nAI-accelerated tasks. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Keep in mind when this event takes place that raw CPU performance isn’t what makes Apple silicon great. It’s performance-per-watt, along with the efficiencies of the entire OSes being optimized for the architecture.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After years of failed promises from Qualcomm, Microsoft believes \nthe upcoming Snapdragon X Elite processors will finally offer the \nperformance it has been looking for to push Windows on Arm much \nmore aggressively. Microsoft is now betting big on Qualcomm’s \nupcoming Snapdragon X Elite processors, which will ship in a \nvariety of Windows laptops this year and Microsoft’s latest \nconsumer-focused Surface hardware. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the next version of Bluetooth might offer rock-solid reliability.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Microsoft is so confident in these new Qualcomm chips that it’s \nplanning a number of demos that will show how these processors \nwill be faster than an M3 MacBook Air for CPU tasks, AI \nacceleration, and even app emulation. Microsoft claims, in \ninternal documents seen by The Verge, that these new Windows AI \nPCs will have “faster app emulation than Rosetta 2” — the \napplication compatibility layer that Apple uses on its Apple \nSilicon Macs to translate apps compiled for 64-bit Intel \nprocessors to Apple’s own processors. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Faster x86 emulation than Rosetta 2 would be quite the achievement, but is it really a bragging point? Three-and-a-half years into the Mac’s Apple silicon era, we’re so far into the transition that almost every app is now native. Are there any remaining pro Mac apps, where performance matters, that still only run under Rosetta?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/09/microsoft-surface-event-arm-chips\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"366ea4853759a43140ea47259eb3e222c13712798719a9255631b2aa1ef84077","category":"Tech"}
