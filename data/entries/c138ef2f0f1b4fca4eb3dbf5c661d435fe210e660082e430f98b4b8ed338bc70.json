{"title":"The Murky World of ZFC Zero Friction Cycling: Botched Testing, Frigged Results","link":"https://www.hambini.com/the-murky-world-of-zfc-zero-friction-cycling-botched-testing-frigged-results/","date":1726679989000,"content":"Zero Friction Cycling, run by former policeman Adam Kerin, presents itself as a trusted source for friction-reducing products, but behind the scenes, a lack of engineering knowledge and unverified testing methods raise red flags. Despite requesting sensitive industry data without doing foundational research, Kerin's approach appears more focused on marketing high-margin products than adhering to rigorous engineering standards. His testing setup is flawed, and the data he presents, particularly in support of ceramic bearings and chain lubricants, lacks scientific backing. Is this the work of an expert or just another slick sales pitch?","author":"admin","siteTitle":"Hambini Engineering","siteHash":"1914e5a1ff85f6709ba64c29f2993b45bb8ae4b7452977e0a1f13e2e79329648","entryHash":"c138ef2f0f1b4fca4eb3dbf5c661d435fe210e660082e430f98b4b8ed338bc70","category":"Cycling"}
