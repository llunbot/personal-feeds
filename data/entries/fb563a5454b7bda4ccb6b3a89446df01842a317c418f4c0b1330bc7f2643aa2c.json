The problem is they are less energy-efficient than fixed-wing aircraft, which can fly greater distances and stay airborne for longer but need a runway, a dedicated launcher, or at least a good old-fashioned throw to get to the skies.</p>\n<p>To get past this limit, a team of Swiss researchers at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne built a fixed-wing flying robot called RAVEN (Robotic Avian-inspired Vehicle for multiple ENvironments) with a peculiar bio-inspired landing gear: a pair of robotic bird-like legs. “The RAVEN robot can walk, hop over obstacles, and do a jumping takeoff like real birds,” says Won Dong Shin, an engineer leading the project.</p>\n<h2>Smart investments</h2>\n<p>The key challenge in attaching legs to drones was that they significantly increased mass and complexity. State-of-the-art robotic legs were designed for robots walking on the ground and were too bulky and heavy to even think about using on a flying machine. So, Shin’s team started their work by taking a closer look at what the leg mass budget looked like in various species of birds.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/robotic-bird-like-legs-let-drones-hop-over-obstacles-launch-to-the-skies/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/robotic-bird-like-legs-let-drones-hop-over-obstacles-launch-to-the-skies/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fb563a5454b7bda4ccb6b3a89446df01842a317c418f4c0b1330bc7f2643aa2c","category":"Tech"}
