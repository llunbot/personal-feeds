This is the stock photo from KLOV/VAPS and was one of the few images of the pneumatic machine available during my initial research.

It was also said that if you hit a button hard enough, you could knock out your opponent with one hit! Certain people were supposedly seen climbing on and jumping up and down on the buttons of the machine in the hope of making a killing strike.\n<p>As a child of the '80s who loved video games, this game intrigued me.</p>\n<p>I soon discovered that the game was called <em>Street Fighter</em> (<em>SF1</em>), and it was made by a company called Capcom. In my local arcade, it consisted of a large, curvy cabinet with two sets of controls to accommodate two players at once. Each player had a start button, an eight-way joystick, and two large pressure-sensitive rubber buttons. This cabinet is now often called the \"deluxe\" or \"crescent\" cab, and the pressure-sensitive buttons are often called \"bash pads\" or \"pneumatic buttons.\" It looked totally rad.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923290#p3\">Read 94 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923290&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c2a39310dee54957aec9e462e8632906d33815e747cb9439d3a2ef203720d40b","category":"Tech"}
