However, this change is only visible in vehicles with a larger center display. For example, a MacRumors Forums member <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-beta-1-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2449908/post-33753569\">noticed the change</a> in a Toyota Tundra, which can be equipped with up to a 14-inch screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnd on some wide displays, CarPlay now shows five columns of icons, up from the standard four.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn our testing, CarPlay still showed two rows of four icons in a Honda Civic with a 9-inch screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile this is only a minor change, CarPlay showing more icons when possible is a nice quality-of-life improvement for Apple's phone mirroring system, allowing drivers to quickly access more apps with less swiping between pages.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing beta testing, iOS 18.4 is expected to be released to the public in early April.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/23/ios-18-4-carplay-change/\">iOS 18.4 Includes a Small But Useful Change for CarPlay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-includes-a-small-but-useful-change-for-carplay.2450039/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4047415f919237937667276ae5d8e65e8a077ea80d890692d1f1a27f2e726298","category":"Apple"}
