According to a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-imessage-text-effects/&amp;xcust=1-1-2353012-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MacRumors story</a> citing “multiple sources familiar with the matter,” iOS 18 is going to take the fun text effects a step further by allowing you to add text effects to <em>individual words within the message</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not clear if these will be the same text effects currently available to entire messages, entirely new ones (like bold or italics), or something else entirely. You can already add a handful of fun <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1525097/how-to-imessage-effects-balloon-glitter-lasers.html\">effects to your iMessages</a>. There are full-screen effects like balloons, lasers, and confetti, or text effects like slam or invisible ink. Those text effects apply to your entire message, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Messages in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a> is expected to get quite an upgrade with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2141884/iphone-imessage-rcs-support-later-in-2024.html\">RCS support</a> allowing for much better communication with Android phones, AI-powered autocomplete features, and maybe even custom <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2346900/apples-ios-18-macos-15-generaticve-ai-emoji-wwdc.html\">AI-generated emojis</a>. It’s not clear if these text effects will apply only to iMessages or will work with RCS messages as well, but Apple is incentivized to continue making iMessage a more full-featured and desirable alternative to the “green bubbles,” even if Android users can send messages that are more advanced that the current SMS ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll learn about all the changes coming to Messages in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS 15</a> at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC in June</a>.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f714fd03f5c253059c8082d63cdc5c773b093b3f6c6b6236b8b8fef0af6bf327","category":"Apple"}
