We get it. Bikerumor staffers try phone mounts regularly, and many come back to QuadLock and keep mounts on all of their bikes (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2018/11/05/review-quad-lock-iphone-x-case-out-front-bike-mount-keeps-smartphone-camera-ready/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">read our full review here</a>).</p><p>The QuadLock system includes a case, your choice of two out-front handlebar mounts, or a strap-on stem mount. Your phone connects in the same way that cycling computers attach to their mount – pop it on and twist it to lock. The mount holds your phone securely, yet it’s easy to detach it quickly. The cases are slim but protective, and the mounts are sleek enough that they won’t look out of place on rides without your phone on it.</p><p>While this case/mount combo is pricier than others upfront, additional mounts are relatively inexpensive. You’re committing to a system, but QuadLock has been around since 2011 and keeps up with new phone technology, so you can rest assured that your new phone will have a QuadLock case that works with it (they were shipping iPhone 13 cases just a couple weeks after Apple debuted them). And they make mounts for everything: Dash, moto, suction cup, tripod, armband, stick-on, desktop, and more. There’s even a clear silicone “poncho” cover to protect it from inclement weather.</p><p>Got a case you already love? Just order the stick-on adapter to use it with any of their mounts. The company makes cases for iPhone, Galaxy, Pixel, Huawei, and a even universal option.</p><p><strong>MSRP:</strong>$60-$90 for case+mount kit, depending on mount<strong><br>PROS</strong>: Full system with different mount options, ultra secure, camera ready<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Case may not work well with all wireless chargers<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;FLOOR PUMP: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F132166%2Ftopeak-joeblow-sport-iii-bike-floor-pump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Topeak Joe Blow Sport 3</a>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111906/topeak-joe-blow-sport-3-bicycle-floor-pump.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111906/topeak-joe-blow-sport-3-bicycle-floor-pump.jpg\" alt=\"topeak joe blow sport 3 bicycle floor pump review\" width=\"1072\" height=\"1177\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111906/topeak-joe-blow-sport-3-bicycle-floor-pump.jpg 1072w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111906/topeak-joe-blow-sport-3-bicycle-floor-pump-273x300.jpg 273w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111906/topeak-joe-blow-sport-3-bicycle-floor-pump-800x878.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111906/topeak-joe-blow-sport-3-bicycle-floor-pump-109x120.jpg 109w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111906/topeak-joe-blow-sport-3-bicycle-floor-pump-768x843.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111906/topeak-joe-blow-sport-3-bicycle-floor-pump-696x764.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111906/topeak-joe-blow-sport-3-bicycle-floor-pump-1068x1173.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/07111906/topeak-joe-blow-sport-3-bicycle-floor-pump-383x420.jpg 383w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px\"></a></p><p>If you’re not a longtime cyclist, you may not realize that even if your tires need air until it’s too late.

If you only ride to work occasionally, you can likely get away without a specific bike commuter-friendly backpack, though some gear like a sturdy bike lock is non-negotiable.</p><p><strong>Consider where you’re riding.</strong> If you’re doing a longer or harder ride to get to the office, you may want to streamline your accessories with a focus on saving weight and wearing cycling gear that’s more cycling-specific, then changing at the office. If you’re doing a short commuter by bike, you can likely use a heavier bike that allows you to carry all of your gear comfortably. And if you’re doing a half-and-half commute where you take a train or bus partway, commuter accessories that are just as useful when walking are great options.</p><p><strong>You always need a lock.</strong> Period. Even if you normally keep your bike in the office, you never know when a bike room is going to be closed for repair, or you need to run a quick errand on your way home. (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/08/02/best-bike-locks/\">We have a list of the best locks right here</a>.)</p><p><strong>Focus on safety.</strong> We included plenty of safety-focused accessories in this roundup because prioritizing safety on your commute is key. That means a helmet, reflective gear, appropriate lights, and even clothing that won’t get caught in your chain as you pedal!</p><div id=\"attachment_270718\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07081213/scott-axis-eride-evo-tour-fs-fox-awl-fork-pannier-rack-commuter-ebike.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-270718\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07081213/scott-axis-eride-evo-tour-fs-fox-awl-fork-pannier-rack-commuter-ebike.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07081213/scott-axis-eride-evo-tour-fs-fox-awl-fork-pannier-rack-commuter-ebike.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07081213/scott-axis-eride-evo-tour-fs-fox-awl-fork-pannier-rack-commuter-ebike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07081213/scott-axis-eride-evo-tour-fs-fox-awl-fork-pannier-rack-commuter-ebike-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07081213/scott-axis-eride-evo-tour-fs-fox-awl-fork-pannier-rack-commuter-ebike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07081213/scott-axis-eride-evo-tour-fs-fox-awl-fork-pannier-rack-commuter-ebike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07081213/scott-axis-eride-evo-tour-fs-fox-awl-fork-pannier-rack-commuter-ebike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-270718\">Photo c. Scott Sports</p></div><h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Bike Commuting</h2><p><strong>What kind of bike do I need for a commute?</strong><br>Different styles of bike might suit different types of riders. For instance, commuters who ride the train or bus for part of their commute before pedaling the final stretch may prefer a folding bike that can be stored under a seat. For longer commutes, a road bike (and a full change of clothing at the office) might be preferable and more efficient.</p><p>Alternatively, for longer commutes or for riders who need a bit of a boost, an e-bike might be ideal. And if you live in a small apartment or you’re on a tight budget, your best option for a commuter bike might simply be whatever type of bike you prefer to ride when you’re riding for fun. Don’t feel like you’re locked into a strictly “commuter” option, consider your needs and how you prefer to ride. But if you are looking for something new, we have a roundup of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/07/28/best-commuter-bikes/\">our favorite commuter bikes right here.</a></p><p><strong>Do I need a messenger bag, backpack or panniers?</strong><br>It depends how much you bring to the office! We don’t really love messenger bags unless you’re actually a bike messenger who needs to regularly swing your bag around for easy access. Because they will swing down, and, honestly, can be kind of annoying.</p><p>We do love a good backpack, though, especially if you’re only bringing a laptop and maybe a few small items to and from work. But if you bring a lot with you to and from the office, a bike with a rear rack and panniers (that can convert into easy-to-carry tote bags) is a great solution. It helps avoid back sweat, and allows you to carry everything from your computer to your lunch to a full change of clothing. They’re great for farmer’s market runs, too!</p><div id=\"attachment_260350\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/28123850/Nutcase-Helmet-Brand-Image.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-260350\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/28123850/Nutcase-Helmet-Brand-Image.jpg\" alt=\"Father and child on bike wearing nutcase helmets\" width=\"1200\" height=\"751\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/28123850/Nutcase-Helmet-Brand-Image.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/28123850/Nutcase-Helmet-Brand-Image-297x186.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/28123850/Nutcase-Helmet-Brand-Image-800x501.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/28123850/Nutcase-Helmet-Brand-Image-120x75.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/28123850/Nutcase-Helmet-Brand-Image-768x481.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/28123850/Nutcase-Helmet-Brand-Image-696x436.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/28123850/Nutcase-Helmet-Brand-Image-1068x668.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/28123850/Nutcase-Helmet-Brand-Image-671x420.jpg 671w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-260350\">Commuter helmets come in all shapes, sizes &amp; colors. Photo c. Nutcase</p></div><p><strong>Do I need a commuter helmet?</strong><br>Absolutely not—you can use whatever helmet you have at home. We do like having a commuter helmet in addition to your nice road or MTB one, though, because commuter helmets tend to be a bit less pricey, a bit more comfort-focused, and less likely to leave you with Helmet Hair.</p><p><strong>What should I keep at the office to make my commute smoother?</strong><br>We suggest keeping a small bag of ‘extras’ at the office to make your commute easier. They can include:</p><ul><li>Office shoes (especially if you only wear one type of shoe in the office, like a basic loafer, so you can change out of cycling shoes or sneakers when you get there)</li><li>Deodorant</li><li>Body wipes for sweatier-than-anticipated rides</li><li>Full change of clothing, including underwear (you never know when a sudden rainstorm or—unfortunately—a crash can mess up your work clothes during your commute, so having a spare set can be helpful in a pinch)</li><li>Any easy extras that you would normally bring to and from work every day, like a coffee mug</li><li>Charging cables for your bike lights (in case you forgot to charge at home)</li></ul><p><strong>What should I carry with me on the ride?</strong><br>You may be tempted to leave your mini-pump at home, but carry all of the same bike tools you’d take on a normal ride—bike pump, spare tube, patch kit, and multi-tool. If you’re not great at fixing a flat, take some time and practice so that if you do get a flat on the way to work, you don’t miss the morning meeting because you’re on the side of the road trying to pry a tire off.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SKS-Longboard_extended-mud-flap-full-coverage-Bluemels-road-bike-commuter-fenders-mudguards_front-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SKS-Longboard_extended-mud-flap-full-coverage-Bluemels-road-bike-commuter-fenders-mudguards_front-detail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SKS-Longboard_extended-mud-flap-full-coverage-Bluemels-road-bike-commuter-fenders-mudguards_front-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SKS-Longboard_extended-mud-flap-full-coverage-Bluemels-road-bike-commuter-fenders-mudguards_front-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SKS-Longboard_extended-mud-flap-full-coverage-Bluemels-road-bike-commuter-fenders-mudguards_front-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SKS-Longboard_extended-mud-flap-full-coverage-Bluemels-road-bike-commuter-fenders-mudguards_front-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SKS-Longboard_extended-mud-flap-full-coverage-Bluemels-road-bike-commuter-fenders-mudguards_front-detail-600x400.jpg 600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SKS-Longboard_extended-mud-flap-full-coverage-Bluemels-road-bike-commuter-fenders-mudguards_front-detail-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SKS-Longboard_extended-mud-flap-full-coverage-Bluemels-road-bike-commuter-fenders-mudguards_front-detail-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SKS-Longboard_extended-mud-flap-full-coverage-Bluemels-road-bike-commuter-fenders-mudguards_front-detail-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"></a></p><p><strong>How do I attach a rack or fenders to my bike?</strong><br>If your bike has eyelets (also referred to as bosses, rack mounts, or fender mounts) near the dropouts on the frame and fork and some higher up near the seat post clamp or fork crown, chances are you can use the bolt-on style rack like the Topeak one we recommend here.</p><p>If not, you’ll want to look at universal racks like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N6RORTM/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thule Tour Rack</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ASSQJYU/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">optional side frames</a> if you want to add panniers.

If you’re leaving your bike locked outside, especially in higher crime areas, then you need a locking axle on the wheels if you want to keep them.</p><p>These replace your quick-release skewers and require a special key or tool (or both) to remove, and more time, all of which are very strong deterrents for would-be thieves.&nbsp;Left to right, here are our three favorite options:</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23131452/best-locking-bicycle-wheel-skewers-to-prevent-wheel-theft-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23131452/best-locking-bicycle-wheel-skewers-to-prevent-wheel-theft-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"the best locking bike wheel skewers to prevent bicycle wheel theft\" width=\"2560\" height=\"713\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23131452/best-locking-bicycle-wheel-skewers-to-prevent-wheel-theft-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23131452/best-locking-bicycle-wheel-skewers-to-prevent-wheel-theft-297x83.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23131452/best-locking-bicycle-wheel-skewers-to-prevent-wheel-theft-800x223.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23131452/best-locking-bicycle-wheel-skewers-to-prevent-wheel-theft-120x33.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23131452/best-locking-bicycle-wheel-skewers-to-prevent-wheel-theft-768x214.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23131452/best-locking-bicycle-wheel-skewers-to-prevent-wheel-theft-1536x428.jpg 1536w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23131452/best-locking-bicycle-wheel-skewers-to-prevent-wheel-theft-2048x570.jpg 2048w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23131452/best-locking-bicycle-wheel-skewers-to-prevent-wheel-theft-696x194.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23131452/best-locking-bicycle-wheel-skewers-to-prevent-wheel-theft-1068x297.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23131452/best-locking-bicycle-wheel-skewers-to-prevent-wheel-theft-1920x535.jpg 1920w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23131452/best-locking-bicycle-wheel-skewers-to-prevent-wheel-theft-1508x420.jpg 1508w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"></a></p><p><strong>Hexlox Skewers<br></strong>Perhaps the sleekest, lightest, and coolest anti-theft wheel skewers out there, the Hexlox bolts use a proprietary plug-and-key system to effectively block access to the bolt. Meaning, you can’t insert an Allen wrench to loosen the axle until you’ve removed the plug…and you absolutely can not do that unless you have the key. You can even buy just the plug-and-key sets to secure your seatpost, saddle, stem, and almost any other part on your bike! MSRP is $70 for a complete set, available <a href=\"https://hexlox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">directly from Hexlox</a>. Or <a href=\"https://robertaxleproject.com/product/hexlox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">just add the cap</a> to your existing thru axle!</p><p><strong>Pinhead Quick Release Skewers</strong><br>Similar to Hexlox, except using a keyed pattern on a matching lever that acts as both key and tool to remove the bolt. Not quite as stealthy, but a little more affordable at $60 MSRP. Available through <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001Y9VNS4/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=0d15472d-796a-41f7-afb4-32437118891b&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fequipment%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-racks-fenders-locks%2Fbike-locks%2Fpinhead-quick-release-lock-2-piece-set%2Fp%2F26952%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trek Bikes</a>.</p><p><strong>ABUS NutFix<br></strong>These work a bit differently in that you’ll need a thin 8mm wrench (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CVC5BDL/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">like these</a>) to remove your wheel, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2017/02/16/abus-nutfix-security-wheels-seatposts-now-available/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the NutFix caps</a> simply prevent access to that bolt while the bike is upright &amp; locked to a rack. Meaning, you’ll need to lay your bike flat on the ground for the cap to lift and allow access to the bolt, and we doubt any thief will figure that out. MSRP is $70 for the set, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J9IG2IM/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">available on Amazon</a>. They also make <a href=\"https://www.sears.com/search=ABUS%20NUTFIX%20SOLID%20AXLE%202%20PACK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">larger versions</a> for the bolt-on wheels commonly found on 20″ – 26″ kids’ bikes, must make sure you order the correct M8, M9 or M10 version to match the solid axle’s size!</p><p>All three of these brands also make locking seatpost bolts, too—no one wants to ride home on a bike that no longer has a saddle.</p></section></div>","author":"Molly Hurford","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"cf1c823b3e7b279b1e68692206aad4553d864bd5dc086225007f3a57316e51f6","category":"Cycling"}
