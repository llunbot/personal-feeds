One year later, it added a variant of the same machine with a larger, 15-inch display. Both the 2018 and 2020 Intel-based ‌MacBook Air‌ models have been discontinued. Apple still sells a ‌MacBook Air‌ with this design, the 2020 model with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip starting at $999 – the cheapest ‌MacBook Air‌ available from the company today, and even lower prices may be found with third-party retailers or second-hand. In terms of the latest models, the 13-inch ‌M2‌ ‌MacBook Air‌ starts at $1,099, while the 15-inch ‌M2‌ model starts at $1,299.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSee the breakdown below for each new feature, change, and improvement that was added with each ‌MacBook Air‌ model since 2018 compared to its direct predecessor:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacBook Air (M2, 2022/2023)</h3>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li>Thinner design with flat lid, rounded bottom edges, and uniform thickness</li>\r<br />\n<li>13.6- or 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display</li>\r<br />\n<li>Apple ‌M2‌ chip</li>\r<br />\n<li>Up to 10-core GPU</li>\r<br />\n<li>Hardware-accelerated H.264, HEVC, ProRes and ProRes RAW</li>\r<br />\n<li>ProRes encode and decode engine</li>\r<br />\n<li>Up to 24GB unified memory</li>\r<br />\n<li>100GB/s memory bandwidth</li>\r<br />\n<li>500 nits brightness</li>\r<br />\n<li>1080p <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> HD camera</li>\r<br />\n<li>Four-speaker sound system or six-speaker sound system with force-cancelling woofers </li>\r<br />\n<li>3.5mm headphone jack with support for high-impedance headphones</li>\r<br />\n<li>Bluetooth 5.3</li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> 3</li>\r<br />\n<li>Fast-charge capable with available 70W USB‑C Power Adapter</li>\r<br />\n<li>Available in Silver, Space Gray, Starlight, and Midnight</li>\r<br />\n<li>1.24 kg (2.7 pounds) or 1.51 kg (3.3 pounds)</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacBook Air (M1, 2020)</h3>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li>Apple ‌M1‌ chip</li>\r<br />\n<li>8-core CPU</li>\r<br />\n<li>Up to 8-core GPU</li>\r<br />\n<li>Media engine</li>\r<br />\n<li>Hardware-accelerated H.264 and HEVC</li>\r<br />\n<li>Video decode engine </li>\r<br />\n<li>Video encode engine</li>\r<br />\n<li>16-core Neural Engine</li>\r<br />\n<li>Up to 16GB unified memory</li>\r<br />\n<li>62.5GB/s memory bandwidth</li>\r<br />\n<li>Wide colour (P3)</li>\r<br />\n<li>Image signal processor with computational video</li>\r<br />\n<li>Up to 18-hour battery life</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacBook Air (Intel, 2020)</h3>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li>Up to Intel Core i7 processor</li>\r<br />\n<li>Intel Iris Plus Graphics GPU</li>\r<br />\n<li>Up to 2TB storage</li>\r<br />\n<li>Magic Keyboard</li>\r<br />\n<li>Bluetooth 5.0</li>\r<br />\n<li>1.29 kg (2.8 pounds)</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacBook Air (Intel, 2018)</h3>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n<li>Tapered \"wedge\" design</li>\r<br />\n<li>13.3-inch Retina display</li>\r<br />\n<li>Up to Intel Core i5 processor</li>\r<br />\n<li>Up to 4-core CPU</li>\r<br />\n<li>Intel UHD Graphics 617</li>\r<br />\n<li>Up to 16GB memory</li>\r<br />\n<li>Up to 1.5TB storage</li>\r<br />\n<li>Butterfly Keyboard</li>\r<br />\n<li>400 nits brightness</li>\r<br />\n<li>Full standard colour (sRGB)</li>\r<br />\n<li>720p ‌FaceTime‌ HD camera</li>\r<br />\n<li>Stereo speakers </li>\r<br />\n<li>3.5mm headphone jack</li>\r<br />\n<li>802.11ac Wi‑Fi 6</li>\r<br />\n<li>Bluetooth 4.2</li>\r<br />\n<li>Up to 12-hour battery life</li>\r<br />\n<li>Available in Silver, Space Gray, and Gold</li>\r<br />\n<li>1.25 kg (2.75 pounds)</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the ‌M1‌ ‌MacBook Air‌ is ostensibly good value for money at $999 and can be found even cheaper with education pricing and elsewhere via third-party retailers, it is notable that the ‌M2‌ 13-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ is now just $1,099. 2018 or 2020 Intel ‌MacBook Air‌ users will still benefit from upgrading to the ‌M1‌ ‌MacBook Air‌, but given that it is only $100 cheaper than the ‌M2‌ model – they are much better off upgrading to the latest model. $100 is a comparatively small price to pay for a much newer machine with a more modern design, the ‌M2‌ chip, a larger and brighter display, faster memory, a 1080p camera, better speakers, ‌MagSafe‌ 3, fast-charging, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/13-vs-15-inch-macbook-air/\">13-Inch vs. 15-Inch M2 MacBook Air Buyer's Guide</a></li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost ‌M1‌ ‌MacBook Air‌ users will still stand to benefit from upgrading to the ‌M2‌ model, especially if they are looking for a bigger screen and opt for the 15-inch model, but some will be better off waiting for the next major refresh.
