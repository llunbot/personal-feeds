Surely the \nresponsibility for the Humane AI Pin lies with Humane; the \npeople who benefited from Brownlee’s honesty were his viewers, \nthe only people to whom Brownlee owes anything. To think of this \nreview — or even just the title — as “distasteful” or \n“unethical” is to view Humane — a recognizable entity, to be \nsure — as of more worth than the 3.5 million individuals who \nwatched Brownlee’s review. </p>\n\n<p>This is one of the challenges of scale: Brownlee has so many \nviewers that it is almost easier to pretend like they are some \nunimportant blob. Brownlee, though, is successful because he \nremembers his job is not to go easy on individual companies, but \ninform individual viewers who will make individual decisions about \nspending $700 on a product that doesn’t work. Thanks to the \nInternet he has absolutely no responsibility or incentive to do \nanything but. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The review is now up to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA&amp;t=1287s\">4.2 million views</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/16/mkbhds-for-everything\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6cdff9e0e95a65ef6459c47ada6499ba23a20daa807fcf516759a89c4ca06397","category":"Tech"}
