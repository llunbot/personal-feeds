In the immediate hours after launch on Wednesday, the spacecraft was beset by two helium leaks in its propulsion system. Then, on Thursday, several of Starliner's spacecraft thrusters went offline for a time. Far more often than originally planned, spacecraft commander Butch Wilmore had to take manual control of Starliner while engineers on the ground worked on these and other issues.</p>\n<p>However, at 1:34 pm ET on Thursday, Wilmore and the mission's other crew member, Suni Williams, successfully docked with the space station. A couple of hours later, they floated through the hatch, making a triumphant entry onto the station—and making history.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029550#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029550&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9f2daf8ebf35a04bd1539372b337a77bc34f5b270d9081a0cc23987ab5c1ce9e","category":"Tech"}
