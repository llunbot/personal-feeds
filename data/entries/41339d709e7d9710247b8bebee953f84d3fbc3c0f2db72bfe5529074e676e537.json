It’s wireless and works inside a small room, RV, van, or even a tent with no installation required. That said, it comes with exhaust duct adapters for more efficient climate control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WAVE 2 is 20% smaller than its predecessor and has 27% more power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The compressor creates 5,100 BTU of cooling power that can lower a room’s temperature by 18 degrees in 5 minutes. Likewise, it cranks 6,100 BTU heating to raise the temperature by 18 degrees in 5 minutes. It runs for as long as 8 hours of cooling using an add-on battery. Plugged into an EcoFlow portable power source (like the Delta Max or Delta 2) it can run up to 18 hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, it runs at a library-quiet sound level. A little white noise may just help you sleep more soundly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, read <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ecoflow-portable-cooler-refrigerator-ac-heater-electric-battery/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>our coverage</strong></a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Save at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C6GBB73V?maas=maas_adg_E5446AA7CFF982D0D03D20D5BF6C05B0_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Amazon</strong></a> July 11-12, or at checkout on <a href=\"https://us.ecoflow.com/products/wave-2-portable-air-conditioner\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>EcoFlow’s site</strong></a> through July 16 with promo code <strong>JUNKIEPD</strong>.</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C6GBB73V?maas=maas_adg_E5446AA7CFF982D0D03D20D5BF6C05B0_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas\" target=\"_blank\">Check Price at Amazon</a>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66154X1501138&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=gjdloutdoorpd&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.ecoflow.com%2Fproducts%2Fwave-2-portable-air-conditioner%3Fvariant%3D40541971710025\" target=\"_blank\">Check Price at EcoFlow</a>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZWGZDWT?maas=maas_adg_170B5EDCBFEABB1CEF3F9ECD5AFD7F9E_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas\" target=\"_blank\">GLACIER Portable Car Refrigerator, Cooler &amp; Ice Maker with Extra Battery</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1.png\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-800x450.png\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-800x450.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-297x167.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-120x68.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-768x432.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-400x225.png 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-1200x675.png 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a 3-in-1 refrigerator, ice maker, and power station on wheels.
