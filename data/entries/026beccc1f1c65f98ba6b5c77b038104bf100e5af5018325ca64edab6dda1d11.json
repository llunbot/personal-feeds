Perhaps more importantly, what choice would ChatGPT make?</p>\n<p>Autonomous driving startups are now experimenting with AI chatbot assistants, including one self-driving system that will use one to <a href=\"https://www.virgin.com/about-virgin/latest/wayve-pioneers-new-ai-model-for-autonomous-driving\">explain its driving decisions</a>. Beyond announcing red lights and turn signals, the large language models (LLMs) powering these chatbots may ultimately need to make moral decisions, like prioritizing passengers’ or pedestrian’s safety. In November, one startup called <a href=\"https://www.ghostautonomy.com/blog/ghost-autonomy-announces-investment-from-openai-startup-fund-to-bring-multi-modal-llms-to-autonomous-driving\">Ghost Autonomy</a> announced experiments with ChatGPT to help its software navigate its environment.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009868#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009868&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"026beccc1f1c65f98ba6b5c77b038104bf100e5af5018325ca64edab6dda1d11","category":"Tech"}
