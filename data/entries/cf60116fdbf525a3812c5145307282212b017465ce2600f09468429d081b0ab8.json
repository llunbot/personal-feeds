Where uphill speed matters, the direct connection from crank to axle, without some energy-inefficient suspension spoiling the fun, is the quickest way to get up to speed.</p>\n<p>Riding rough-and-ready trails on a hardtail might beat you up a little more, but there’s something almost zen-like about being able to pick the smoothest line between the chunder, while pumping through rollers to generate free speed.</p>\n<p>Hardtails might also be lighter, easier to maintain and cheaper too, because there are simply fewer moving parts to add weight, a requirement to service or that need building in the first place.</p>\n<p>Here, we’ve put together our pick of the best hardtail mountain bikes as ridden, rated and reviewed by the BikeRadar team.</p>\n<p>While many hardtails make their way into our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-2000\">best mountain bikes under £2,000</a> list, competing with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">best trail bikes</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">best cross-country bikes</a>, the simplicity of hardtails makes them a more affordable option for many.</p>\n<p>So, if you’re looking for a less expensive bike you can <a href=\"#besthardtailunder1000\">skip to the best hardtail mountain bikes for under £1,000</a> below.</p>\n<p>We also have a guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you/\">how to choose the right mountain bike for you</a> if you are still deciding what type of mountain bike to pick.</p>\n\n<section><div>\n        <h2>Best hardtail mountain bikes in 2021</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Bird Forge:</strong> £695 / $952 / €962 (frame only)</li>\n<li><strong>Canyon Stoic 4:</strong> £1,639 / $1,799 / AU$2,649 / €1,699</li>\n<li><strong>Merida Big.

The frame has a 64-degree head tube angle and 77-degree seat tube angle with a long reach and low bottom bracket. We found this slack geometry inspired confidence when the trail got rough, and the short chainstays didn’t make it hard to lift the front wheel over obstacles.</p>\n<p>Bird offers custom builds and our setup with wireless SRAM Eagle, Formula Selva R fork, SRAM G2 RSC brakes and DT Swiss rims on Hope hubs proved to be excellent value for money.</p>\n<p>The only really niggle we had was with the Deathgrips, which made accessing the AXS upshift paddle tricky, but Bird does offer other grip options.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/bird-forge-review/\">Read our full Bird Forge review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Canyon Stoic 4</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Canyon Stoic 4 is a serious contender when it comes to hardtails with downhill potential.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Modern geometry and well-considered spec</li>\n<li>The aluminium frame can be harsh</li>\n<li>£1,639 / $1,799 / AU$2,649 / €1,699 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Canyon Stoic 4 is designed for everything from technical trails to bike park sessions.</p>\n<p>The low and long geometry gave even the best full-suss trails bikes a run for their money when descending – even if the burly aluminium frame did feel a little harsh at times. The trade-off here is that it doesn’t feel as playful as some other bikes.</p>\n<p>Despite the gravity focus, the 75-degree seat tube angle positions your weight nicely, so winding up steep climbs never feels arduous.</p>\n<p>Canyon has opted to spec the smaller frames with 27.5in wheels and the larger frames with 29in wheels.</p>\n<p>This top-specced bike has a 140mm RockShox front fork, SRAM 12-speed NX Eagle drivetrain and Iridium 170mm dropper. Value for money is pretty impressive, which we’ve come to expect from direct-to-consumer brands like Canyon.</p>\n<p>The Stoic 4 should be high on your list if you’re seeking hardtail simplicity with downhill performance.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/canyon-stoic-4-review/\">Read our full Canyon Stoic 4 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Merida Big.Trail 500</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Merida has chosen some top-performing parts for its spec.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Impressive downhill and a comfortable climber</li>\n<li>Fairly noisy on rough terrain</li>\n<li>£1,350 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>It might not be the first brand that comes to mind, but Merida’s Big.Trail 500 is a strong contender in the trail hardtail category.</p>\n<p>While the geometry might not be as long and low as some other bikes, the short seat tube means you can go up a size and effectively unlock a very progressive bike.</p>\n<p>When it comes to performance, the Big.Trail is impressive downhill with the Recon fork aiding the aluminium frame’s calm handling. The bike is also a competent climber, with the Shimano Deore 11-52t cassette providing a low enough gear to get you up steep inclines.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of nifty features too, such as internal cabling and mounts for mudguards, and the bike will take a tapered steerer tube if you ever want to upgrade the fork.</p>\n<p>Pick the right size, and the Big.Trail promises to be a fun and impressive bike for the money.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/merida-big-trail-500-review/\">Read our full Merida Big.Trail 500 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Pipedream Moxie Mx3</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This latest Moxie hardtail shares its top tube with The Full Moxie, Pipedream’s full-suspension bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Versatile ride that suits long days out and blasts in the woods</li>\n<li>Frameset only</li>\n<li>£3,300 custom build in testing</li>\n<li>£649 (frameset) as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Pipedream Moxie Mx3 is made from chromoly steel tubes and adaptability is put front and centre.

When climbing, the 77.5-degree seat tube centres your weight nicely.</p>\n<p>The difference between the long and short settings is subtle, but we found the short setting preferable because it gives the bike a fun-loving personality.</p>\n<p>At the time of testing, Pipedream only offered the Moxie as a frameset with no off-the-shelf builds. This means you can customise your build however you want, but we would say be prepared to play around with stem length to get the right handling.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/pipedream-moxie-mx3-review/\">Read our full Pipedream Moxie Mx3 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Canyon Exceed CFR Team</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Canyon Exceed CFR Team is a pure cross-country machine.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Classic XC feel</li>\n<li>Traditional geometry</li>\n<li>£6,229 / AU$9,099 / €5,799 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Exceed CFR Team is Canyon’s thoroughbred XC race bike, with a stiff and uncompromising carbon frame.</p>\n<p>The relatively short and steep geometry puts you in an aggressive position and forces you to push all your effort through the backend.

You can push the wide bar into the 2.5in Maxxis tyres to unlock loads of grip. The fairly low bottom bracket also aids cornering.</p>\n<p>Uphill, the 75-degree seat tube angle centres you nicely above the bottom bracket for comfortable pedalling, but you need to pay attention to rear tyre pressure otherwise the bike can feel draggy on climbs.</p>\n<p>The spec on the bike is decent and the 130mm RockShox 35 fork is good for this end of the market.
