You can snatch a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D54JZTHY/\">four-pack of AirTags for $70 right now</a>, a 29 percent discount on its $99 MSRP and bringing the price down to just $17.50 per AirTag. If you’d rather just get one, it will <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWXNS552/\">only cost you $19</a>, but you get an even better value from the larger pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These AirTags are extremely useful because they’re affordable and can help you keep track of your keys, wallet, or luggage when you’re traveling. They’re super easy to set up with your iPhone or iPad, offering precise tracking complete with pointing their location on the map.
