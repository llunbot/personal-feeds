These five tips will turn you into one too","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2500811/mac-power-user-tips-accessories-displays-macos-storage.html","date":1740652200000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the great aspects of the Mac is that it’s just about ready to go right out of the box. Yes, macOS takes you through a few steps to set up your new machine, but after that, you can get to work. And that’s probably what most people do, only adjusting macOS settings when absolutely necessary and using whatever accessories that came with the Mac. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you don’t spend some time getting to know it, you’re not taking full advantage of your Mac. From the vital points of contact such as your mouse and keyboard, to pulling the curtain of macOS’s polished exterior to adjust settings and make hidden tweaks, you’re not far from being a serious power user. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are five things you can do that will make your Mac experience immediately better. These range from accessories to settings and tweaks that will improve usability. You’ll also find that you’re working more efficiently, saving time, and being more productive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. <strong>Ditch Apple’s accessories</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The only Macs that include a keyboard and mouse are the iMac and Mac Pro. Regardless of what Mac you are buying, when you buy directly from Apple, the only choices you have are Apple’s own Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/magic-mouse-mac-pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Magic Mouse Mac Pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/magic-mouse-mac-pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/magic-mouse-mac-pro.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/magic-mouse-mac-pro.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/magic-mouse-mac-pro.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/magic-mouse-mac-pro.jpg?resize=1200%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/magic-mouse-mac-pro.jpg?resize=1536%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/magic-mouse-mac-pro.jpg?resize=2048%2C2048&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/magic-mouse-mac-pro.jpg?resize=1240%2C1240&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The Magic Mouse looks nice, but you can find a third-party mouse that’s more useful.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Magic Mouse itself has a series of unfortunate attributes that make it less than ideal. Its charging port is on the bottom so you can’t use it while it charges. Furthermore, it is not the best ergonomically or most responsive technically. Lags and other quirky behaviors can often be experienced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re better off going with a third-party mouse. A popular favorite is the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2374078/logitech-mx-master-3s-for-mac-review-seven-button-wonder-mouse.html\">Logitech MX Master 3S</a>, which comes in both grey and white. It works via Bluetooth but the wireless USB dongle offers better connectivity (if you can spare a USB port). Keep in mind the Mac-branded version does not include this dongle, so look for the PC version that does. It works perfectly fine on a Mac since it is the same mouse. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mice.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Mac mice and Magic Trackpad\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mice.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mice.jpg?resize=300%2C262&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mice.jpg?resize=768%2C669&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mice.jpg?resize=1200%2C1046&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mice.jpg?resize=1536%2C1339&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-mice.jpg?resize=2048%2C1785&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1046\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Don’t limit yourself to the Magic Mouse.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The world of mice is vast and you’ll find plenty of other options. Mice meant for gaming often work wonderfully on the Mac and have terrific ergonomics. They are often fine-tuned for precision, tactility, and responsiveness. Some, such as Logitech, even offer software for the Mac so that you can configure your mouse as you’d like. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some brands, like Razer, work out of the box but don’t allow further tweaking since they do not offer Mac software for customization. Third-party apps, such as <a href=\"https://macmousefix.com/\">Mac Mouse Fix</a>, can help you regain some of that control. Mapping key buttons such as back, forward, and even Mission Control can make for a more fluid workflow. We also have some tips on <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671652/how-to-right-click-on-a-mac.html\">getting the most out of the second button on a mouse</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a MacBook Pro user and love the trackpad, consider picking up a Magic Trackpad for desktop use. You can even use it alongside a mouse. Video editors often use both to maximize the flexibility of mouse accuracy and the scrolling capabilities of the Magic Trackpad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keyboards are a similar story to mice–choice is abundant. The Magic Keyboard has Touch ID and works seamlessly with the Mac, but its shallow typing touch is lacking. You give up some convenience with third-party keyboards, but you gain a more satisfying typing experience. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/keychron.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Keychron Q5\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/keychron.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/keychron.jpg?resize=300%2C147&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/keychron.jpg?resize=768%2C377&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/keychron.jpg?resize=1200%2C589&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/keychron.jpg?resize=1536%2C754&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/keychron.jpg?resize=2048%2C1005&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"589\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Mechanical keyboards like the Keychron Q5 Max are popular.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Mechanical keyboards have been all the rage lately, and many work wonderfully with the Mac. The <a href=\"https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q5-max-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard\">Keychron Q5 Max</a>, for example, offers Mac keys, Bluetooth, and a buttery smooth tactile feel. Glorious offers products such as the <a href=\"https://www.gloriousgaming.com/collections/gmmk-3-keyboards\">GMMK Pro</a> which has Mac keys and a customizable experience. Logitech also makes the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668394/the-best-keyboards-for-mac.html\">MX Keys S for the Mac</a>, which pairs nicely with its MX 3S mouse. Many keyboards will have a toggle switch to go from PC to Mac, for keys to function as you’d expect. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other accessories to jazz up your setup include a good pair of speakers. While some monitors will have them built-in, separate external speakers offer a much better audio experience. The <a href=\"https://www.harmankardon.com/home-audio/HK+SOUNDSTICKS+4.html\">Harman Kardon Sound Sticks</a>, famously designed by Jony Ive, are still around and sound great. The <a href=\"https://us.creative.com/p/speakers/creative-pebble-x-plus\">Creative Pebble X</a> can upgrade your sound without much wire clutter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more options, check out our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668394/the-best-keyboards-for-mac.html\">Best Mac keyboards</a> we’ve reviewed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Add s second display</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The MacBook Pro has a gorgeous Retina display, but it still tops out at only 16 inches. An iMac is 24 inches, but in a production workflow, the screen can feel restrictive. A larger display or multiple displays can significantly improve your workflow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple 5K Studio display pairs wonderfully with the Mac and slots in significantly cheaper than the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667913/apple-pro-display-xdr-review-hands-on.html\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>. It also adds the capability to both charge the MacBook and connect the display via a single Thunderbolt cable. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">Apple Studio Display</a> has an excellent speaker system, and with its built-in camera, it can also minimize the number of devices that you’d need for a teleconferencing setup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are thinking about getting a display, it <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668700/best-mac-monitors-displays.html\">doesn’t have to be one by Apple</a>. Macs can support high-refresh rate monitors at 4K and even 6K resolutions at 60Hz. The increased resolution alone of some options can be beneficial to your workflow, opening more on-screen pixels for your desktop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If going from a 16-inch to, say, a 27-inch display isn’t enough to turbocharge your workflow, consider upping the monitor count. With a two-monitor setup, the main display can serve the function of activities that you need to do directly. This will be writing, browsing the web, working with Final Cut Pro, etc. The second monitor can serve the purpose of displaying more static information that is accessible via a simple glance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to use it for Mail or iMessage, so I can quickly look at incoming messages. A third screen opens up even more possibilities—the third display can serve as another static place for stuff you reference throughout the day. It can also be where you can keep Finder open to move files around all screens, or even have a video playing without needing to minimize other apps. The Mac can also support an ultrawide display–some of which come with USB-C charging for your MacBook. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-ultra-wide.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Mac with an ultra ultrawide display\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-ultra-wide.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-ultra-wide.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-ultra-wide.jpg?resize=768%2C427&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-ultra-wide.jpg?resize=1200%2C667&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-ultra-wide.jpg?resize=1536%2C853&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-ultra-wide.jpg?resize=2048%2C1137&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-ultra-wide.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"667\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>An ultrawide display is a good alternative to having two displays, but it may not support higher resolutions.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to add additional monitors, you need to understand how many your Mac can support. We have a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675869/how-to-connect-two-or-more-external-displays-to-apple-silicon-m1-macs.html\">guide to connecting two or more external displays on M-series Macs</a>, but the gist is that the more powerful the chip, the more displays it can handle.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t have the space or budget for multiple monitors, there are other workarounds, too. MacBook Air and Pro users can use their laptop as a second monitor when connected to an external display. The iPad Pro can also serve as a second display, with continuity making the experience seamless. Continuity works across all your Apple devices, such as iPhone, Watch, and iPad. You can even use your iPhone as a webcam for video conferencing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universal control allows you to use the same mouse and keyboard directly on your Mac and iPad simultaneously, doubling its utility as a second screen. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ipad-studio-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Studio Display and iPad\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ipad-studio-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ipad-studio-display.jpg?resize=300%2C154&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ipad-studio-display.jpg?resize=768%2C394&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ipad-studio-display.jpg?resize=1200%2C615&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ipad-studio-display.jpg?resize=1536%2C787&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ipad-studio-display.jpg?resize=2048%2C1050&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"615\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Got an iPad Pro?

Unleash the hidden power tools in macOS </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming a Mac power user also means making the most out of macOS. Apple builds tremendous tools within the Mac operating system to make your workflow easier and faster. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The simplest keyboard shortcuts can make your everyday tasks move gracefully. For example, pressing Command + Space Bar quickly brings up Spotlight Search. A Mission Control shortcut can be mapped either to your keyboard or a button on your mouse. It is by far the easiest way to move around macOS with many apps open. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/edit-widgets.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Edit Widgets in macOS\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/edit-widgets.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/edit-widgets.jpg?resize=300%2C160&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/edit-widgets.jpg?resize=768%2C410&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/edit-widgets.jpg?resize=1200%2C640&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/edit-widgets.jpg?resize=1536%2C819&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/edit-widgets.jpg?resize=2048%2C1092&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"640\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>You can add lots of widgets  to personalize and enhance your desktop</p>.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Widgets, especially when paired with large or multiple screens, can keep information handy for when you need it. Everything from stocks, and news, to the weather can be customized and save you time opening apps. For example, a widget displaying the battery status of a connected Apple device can be a huge help–your AirPods may need a charge, for example. It is an easy way to have one less surprise throughout your day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiding your Dock can also be a clever way to free up screen space. If using multiple screens, simply hovering near the bottom of the screen with the mouse pointer will move the dock to that monitor. You can also automatically show and hide the dock, by going to your Mac’s settings under Desktop &amp; Dock. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Expand your storage options</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the most affordable standard configurations, Macs typically come with stingy internal storage sizes. You may need to fork up more dough for pricy upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you can use the Mac’s Thunderbolt/USB-C ports to connect an external storage device. With a MacBook, you’ll want to use the external drives for files you don’t necessarily need all the time, unless you’re going to use a portable external drive and will carry it along with your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668458/best-external-ssd-for-mac.html\">Best external SSD for Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668430/best-external-hard-drive-for-mac.html\">Best Hard Drive for Mac</a>. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-pro-external-storage.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Mac Pro external storage\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-pro-external-storage.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-pro-external-storage.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-pro-external-storage.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-pro-external-storage.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-pro-external-storage.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-pro-external-storage.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-pro-external-storage.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mac-pro-external-storage.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>External storage devices make file management much easier.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use an external drive Time Machine, macOS’s utility that can perform automatic backups of your Mac. If you do need to recover a file, it is easy to go back to a certain date, find it, and recover the file. Time Machine is handy if you work with large files that are too bulky for frequent cloud backups, such as video files. (There are other Mac backup options in our round up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668696/best-mac-backup-software.html\">Best software to backup your Mac</a>). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managing external drives on the Mac has been fairly straightforward, with Disk Utility serving as your control center for formatting drives, portioning them, and mounting/dismounting them from the Desktop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t want to use an external drive? You can use <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2495742/icloud-drive-review.html\">iCloud</a> to seamlessly integrate with your Mac if you sync the Desktop and Documents folder. Anything that you drop in these areas will automatically go to iCloud and be visible on other devices. Likewise, turn the setting on to access iCloud data on the web, so have access anywhere. iCloud backup also works seamlessly with the Mac and you will not need to add external storage. It does come at an extra cost and will be limited by your internet connection if you need to move around large files frequently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do decide to add an external drive—and even if you don’t–you may want to pair your Mac with a good Thunderbolt dock to supply more ports. Along with conveniences such as SD card slots, Thunderbolt docks can also give you a smattering of USB-A and Thunderbolt ports. This can be especially useful for those using a laptop as a workstation. They can even charge and provide display functionality, too.

Embrace Apple’s changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is something many Mac veterans can lose sight of. Part of being a Mac power user includes embracing changes to the Mac ecosystem. Sure, 2013 Mac Pro owners may still have some sour notes about some changes, but things typically improve with time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One prime bleeding-edge example is the Apple Vision Pro. While it is expensive and has somewhat limited use cases, there are power users who have paired it nicely with their Mac. It can expand your desktop experience significantly, especially with upcoming wide display support. Mirroring your Mac within the Vision Pro is one of the best features these devices can do together. Being in a virtual environment surrounded by your apps and windows has the potential to transform how you work. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac-vision-pro-06.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Mac Pro Apple Vision Pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac-vision-pro-06.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac-vision-pro-06.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac-vision-pro-06.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac-vision-pro-06.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac-vision-pro-06.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac-vision-pro-06.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac-vision-pro-06.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mac-vision-pro-06.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Apple Vision Pro has some promising features that work with the Mac.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thiago Trevisan/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The keyword here is <em>potential</em>–spatial computing is still not ready for prime time. It remains a visionary idea in its infancy, however, with mixed results in actual daily use. Comfort and a more natural integration of the technology will improve over time, as will cost. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mac is not afraid to leave things behind, with Apple often getting criticized by some for some notable changes. The removal of USB ports or even the design of the maligned 2013 Mac Pro still haunts some owners. Still, when Apple gets it right, it is worth it to be on the edge of new Mac changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Intelligence is the next horizon that will make your workflow even better. Boasting some underwhelming features at present, like e-mail summaries, it surely has a lot to improve on. Other improvements in newer software include mirroring your iPhone, helping workflow, or easing distractions while at your desk. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2583512/apple-passwords-review-free-and-simple-password-manager.html\">new Passwords app</a> is also great, piecing together the management of important login information in a more integrated fashion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a> is a key area for power users to keep a keen eye on, however. When implemented fully in the future, it has the potential to change your workflow tremendously. A competent Siri assistant will be able to do much more than it can currently, for example. Apple is pushing towards this goal, but at present remains stifled with no significant features yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of Apple Intelligence features revolve around communication and language, as do most current AI models. Improving text and searching for new information are also primary goals for the technology. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the combination of what is already inside macOS, together with some hardware and accessories, your workflow can reach an entirely new level. A power user is not just focused on the speed, but enjoying the process of using your Mac, too.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"68846c769597503016362da7fc32ac66887ff8a0f98ab9baf47dc32697dafce3","category":"Apple"}
