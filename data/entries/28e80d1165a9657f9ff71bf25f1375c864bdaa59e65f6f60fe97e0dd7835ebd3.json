This is only a minor inconvenience, as charging the mouse is a quick and infrequent process, but it sounds like Apple will finally relocate the port in the accessory's next incarnation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has apparently designed a prototype of the new mouse that incorporates a mixture of touch, voice controls, and hand gestures, making it more suitable for today's computing demands. It reportedly plans to release the new Magic Mouse alongside the OLED, \"M6\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> in 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe overall look of the Magic Mouse has not changed much since 2009, so a redesign seems to be long overdue. Notable changes over the years include switching from AA batteries to a built-in rechargeable battery in 2015, new color-matching options with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> in 2021, and the switch from Lightning to USB-C earlier this year.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-mouse/\">Magic Mouse</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/\">Naver</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/30/redesigned-magic-mouse-coming-in-2026/\">Redesigned Magic Mouse With Touch and Voice Controls Reportedly Coming in 2026</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/redesigned-magic-mouse-with-touch-and-voice-controls-reportedly-coming-in-2026.2446404/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"28e80d1165a9657f9ff71bf25f1375c864bdaa59e65f6f60fe97e0dd7835ebd3","category":"Apple"}
