Apple's focus has been on building developer academies in the region instead of establishing local manufacturing facilities, according to the report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe setback comes at a time when Apple has seen strong iPhone sales globally, especially in China. Indonesia in particular is a significant market for Apple â€“ the country's $1 trillion economy has over 350 million active mobile phones among its 270 million residents.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApproximately 9,000 iPhone 16 units have entered Indonesia through personal imports by passengers, crew members, or postal delivery, but these devices are strictly limited to personal use and cannot be sold commercially, according to ministry officials.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/indonesia/\">Indonesia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/indonesia-bans-iphone-16-sales/\">Apple Banned From Selling iPhone 16 Models in Indonesia</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-banned-from-selling-iphone-16-models-in-indonesia.2441111/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"772a0ab02a7b79ff8b7f04cf4b836cad9b7faa0bfcc561e03598ee172d417969","category":"Apple"}
