His hand covered his mouth in shock as he realised what he was about to do: claim an Olympic silver medal, have his name written in the history books, riding for his country, in his home nation. The chance of a lifetime realised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a rare sight – not the celebration of a silver medal, which in the Olympic Games can represent many things from defeat to the fulfilment of a lifetime dream – but the celebration of second place by a cyclist. In a sport where only one rider can raise their arms as they cross the finish line, where winning is everything. Or at least that’s how it seems at first glance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Olympic Games, and perhaps to a slightly lesser extent, the World Championships, are a rare example of a time when road cyclists can truly celebrate coming second, or even third. To stand on a podium at events like these and to take home a medal – even if it isn’t gold – are some of the highest achievements a cyclist can aspire to. It’s widely accepted that the Olympics doesn’t mean as much in cycling as it does in other sports, where it represents the absolute pinnacle of success, however it doesn’t render an Olympic medal any less significant. If a rider were to enjoy a decade-long career, they may be lucky enough to have three chances to win one of nine medals. That’s pretty low odds, even by cycling standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Olympics aside, it could be argued that Madouas’s reaction, while elevated based on circumstance, represents a broader issue in the world of men’s cycling at the moment. Because to take on so-called ‘superhuman’ riders like Remco Evenepoel and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pogacar-vs-merckx\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a> is to accept that in many, if not all, cases, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-if-tadej-pogacar-didnt-exist\" target=\"_blank\">coming second</a> is the best you can hope for.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Group Two Syndrome</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0077-min-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0077-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0077-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0077-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0077-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0077-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0077-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0077-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0077-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0077-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0077-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Step away from the pomp and ceremony of the major races and the plight of the above-average-but-not-superhuman rider is clear: you enter a race with Tadej Pogačar in (or dependent on the race: Remco Evenepoel or Mathieu van der Poel – or Primoz Roglič if it’s the Vuelta), and you are effectively signing yourself up to lose. The statistics are clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it’s never over until it’s over, and the myriad external factors that can and do occur on a race by race basis may turn the hand of fate against even the most accomplished riders. However probability determines that once one of these titans takes off on a solo jaunt for the win, the likelihood is you’re battling for second place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what options do the rest have once that day’s blistering solo attack is launched? From here, a decision must be made: work together to chase the leader in the vain hope that victory might still an option, or attack one another, aiming for the best outcome they can possibly achieve?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has led to frustration multiple times in recent seasons, as fans urge chasing groups to work together to catch the lone leader, as surely, however good Pogačar or Evenepoel are, physical laws still apply? Surely the might of the many can overpower that of the individual? But call it what you want – mind games, brinkmanship, a societal breakdown in miniature – the cohesion that would be required to orchestrate such a comeback is lost. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it’s lost after they’ve actually worked well together for a time. Perhaps it’s lost the moment one rider stops pulling his weight in the group and they start to look at one another. In reality though, the psychological war has already been waged before a single rider has ridden a pedal stroke in anger. And it’s been won. Usually by the tufted Slovenian, the moment he signs his name and clatters his cleats across the presentation platform that morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not as if breakaways are incapable of making it all the way – even when Pogačar is in a race. Usually though, it’s a Grand Tour stage, and only after UAE have reluctantly loosened their iron grip on the race – but Grand Tours are a different kettle of fish. In a one-day race it’s all-out power, all the way to the line, and the odds are never in your favour. And with every passing race, that certainty becomes more deeply embedded in the collective psyche of the peloton, leading to an ever-quicker relinquishing of hope, and a refocussing, as they prepare to take on those around them rather than engage in a fruitless chase for a victory that’s already gone.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

350w\" /><figcaption>Zac Williams/ZW Photography</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If we’re honest with ourselves, this dominance is here to stay for a while, and after Pogačar has proven he’s capable of attacking from 100km out and still not running out of energy, this pattern of giving up the chase and focussing on the fight for second place will become even more commonplace. It’s a tough pill to swallow if ‘the superhumans’ aren’t your favourite riders, even if you’re impressed their exploits, but on the biggest stages – in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\" target=\"_blank\">Monuments</a>, Worlds and on the top step of the GC at the Grand Tours – these guys probably have a monopoly sewn up for a few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s time, therefore, to get comfortable in our discomfort. To begin to derive pleasure from the fun and games of ‘group two syndrome’ as top riders do battle with one another to achieve the best result that they can. Yes, cycling has traditionally been all about the winning, but beloved riders like <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-history-anquetil-and-poulidor-go-head-to-head\" target=\"_blank\">Raymond Poulidor</a> and more recently <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/wout-van-aert-classics\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a> have become synonymous with that second place position, and rather than ridicule them for being the best ‘bar one’, why not celebrate consistent performances, top ten finishes, podium spots, and generally just having the skill and determination to be up there among the best riders in the world, in an era that truly is going to go down in the history books?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, these positions don’t mean nothing. For the individuals who build <em>palmarès</em> to be proud of it’s something they can look back on after their racing careers and say, ‘I was up there when Pogačar won his fourth Il Lombardia’. In a more practical and immediate sense, for the teams these riders are a part of high placings are genuinely meaningful in terms of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-points-relegation\" target=\"_blank\">UCI points</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a three-year cycle of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\" target=\"_blank\">relegation</a> from the WorldTour, for many of the teams who are launching their best and brightest up the road despite the infinitesimally small possibility of victory, there’s plenty more to play for. The whopping 715 points gleaned by Ben O’Connor for his excellent – and also greatly celebrated – second place to Pogačar at the Worlds road race will buffer the Decathlon-AG2R coffers despite his imminent departure. The 400 points for Pello Bilbao, second in the GP Montreal? Gratefully received by Bahrain Victorious, although not desperately needed – they currently find themselves tenth in the UCI rankings – but every place could mean a more attractive prospect for potential sponsors. The 225 points for Ion Izagirre in fifth place in the same race, by contrast, <em>was </em>desperately needed and likely well celebrated by a Cofidis team languishing at the bottom of the standings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a fan’s perspective, and to the riders who we see giving their all for the win time and time again, winning may be the most important thing, but it’s not everything. To see <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/romain-s-road-romain-bardet-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Romain Bardet</a> placing second at Liège-Bastogne-Liège at the tail end of his career meant so much to so many – not least to his team, who enjoyed the fruits of his labour, 640 delicious UCI points to bolster their total, which they greatly required given their position second from bottom in the rankings. But much more than that, in a race where the Frenchman had stepped off the bike two years prior to help Julian Alaphilippe after a nasty crash, that ‘best of the rest’ finishing position represented a reward for a good man in the form of his career going out on a high in his final full season on the circuit. It really meant something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To look back on your results from the year and see 2s, 3s, even 8s or 9s, could mean the world to a rider – whether it’s the greatest achievement of their entire career or simply because in practical terms it may represent a healthy wedge of prize money or a pay-rise. And while as fans, we’ll never give up hope of our favourites winning – and those sweet moments of victory will remain the pinnacle of the fan experience, however few and far between – let’s cut ourselves, and the riders, a little slack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s celebrate second like it’s a win. Embrace a podium finish and recognise all the hard work that has gone into getting onto that step.

That third place meant something – and these lower placements will continue to enjoy an enhanced level of significance in the years to come – as they always should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps there’s no finer example of the celebration of second and third than Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale’s departing GC leader Ben O’Connor, who not only openly expressed that his aim for the season was to podium at a Grand Tour (he did so at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-a-espana-2024-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">the Vuelta</a>, after coming fourth at the Giro), but also celebrated that success as a win, because it was a fulfilment of an ambition and a proof of his self-belief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As O’Connor and the like set themselves their own personal targets, free of the burden that being a history-defining athlete entails, it’s a reminder to all of us that however cruel sport can be, it also offers athletes an arena in which they can evolve into the best possible versions of themselves. To be able to witness these evolutions, alongside the incredible feats of the once and future kings of the sport, is a true, if not more subtle privilege, and one that can also be celebrated, if, like them, we are able to look beyond victory.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/worldtour-mvp-duos-2024\">Pro cycling MVPs: Which team duos scored the most points in the men’s WorldTour?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-if-tadej-pogacar-didnt-exist\">What if Tadej Pogačar didn’t exist?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pogacar-vs-merckx\">Pogačar vs Merckx: Who had the best season ever?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/valentin-madouas-interview-2024\">Valentin Madouas Q&amp;A: ‘The one major objective for my career is to win a stage at the Tour de France’</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-art-of-second-place\">Comment: The gentle art of coming second in the age of superstars</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"cabb6ece40e82ee35af6800e0c5fb48009064dbc88e4e45c088dea4745a945c1","category":"Cycling"}
