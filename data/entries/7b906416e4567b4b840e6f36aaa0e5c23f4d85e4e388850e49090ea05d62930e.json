However, it is unclear if that info is still accurate, as there have not been any recent HomePod mini rumors from credible sources.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo did not reveal any new features planned for the next HomePod mini, but plausible upgrades could include a newer S-series chip for more advanced computational audio, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip for a lower-latency Handoff experience, and new color options. The current HomePod mini is equipped with an S5 chip and a U1 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has already refreshed the color options for the HomePod mini a few times. The speaker was released in Blue, Orange, and Yellow in November 2021, and Space Gray was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/homepod-mini-midnight-color/\">replaced with a virtually-identical Midnight finish</a> in July.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDue to the lack of recent rumors, the likelihood of a new HomePod mini being imminent seems low. However, a new HomePod mini could end up being a surprise announcement at Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/new-ipad-mini-rumored-for-october/\">rumored October event</a>, or it could be introduced in a press release on the Apple Newsroom website at any point over the coming months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRead our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini roundup</a> for more details about the speaker.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/homepod-mini-2-rumors/\">Will a HomePod Mini 2 Launch This Year?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-a-homepod-mini-2-launch-this-year.2439630/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7b906416e4567b4b840e6f36aaa0e5c23f4d85e4e388850e49090ea05d62930e","category":"Apple"}
