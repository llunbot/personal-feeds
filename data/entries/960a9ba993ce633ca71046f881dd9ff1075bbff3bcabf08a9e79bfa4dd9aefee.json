This is one of the latter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s not much in the iOS 18.1.1 and iPadOS 18.1.1 update other than a pair of <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/121752\">critical security vulnerabilities</a>. But these are important updates to the JavaScript Core framework and WebKit that have been actively exploited already (on Intel-based Macs), according to Apple. The JavaScript vulnerability allows malicious web content to potentially execute arbitrary code, which is very bad. The WebKit flaw opens it up to cross-site scripting attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/121752\">Apple security page</a> says that it is aware of both of them being used on Intel-based Macs, though that doesn’t mean they <em>only</em> affect Intel-based Macs. If you want to trust in the security of your devices, update your iPhones and iPads right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to update to iOS 18.1.1 or iPadOS 18.1.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To update your device, follow these steps when connected to Wi-Fi:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Settings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>General</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>Software Update</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>Update Now</em> and follow the on-screen instructions.</li>\n</ol>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"960a9ba993ce633ca71046f881dd9ff1075bbff3bcabf08a9e79bfa4dd9aefee","category":"Apple"}
