But it appears that Apple is going to start 2025 in a big way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a new <a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/10/23/apple-makes-headway-on-m4-macbook-air-and-plans-new-low-end-ipad/\">report</a> by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is gearing up to start production of the M4 MacBook Air for a release in “early 2025.” How early? Gurman states that Apple has a December software update planned (likely <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">macOS 15.2</a>), and then after that, Apple will release the M4 MacBook Air between January and March of next year. The new MacBook Air will simply be a chip update from the M3 to the M4 for both the 13- and 15-inch models, which Gurman said have the codenames J713 and J715. The M4 MacBook Air release will come about a year after the M3 MacBook was released in March of this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman also reports that the new Mac Studio once had a similar schedule as the M4 MacBook Air, but Apple has decided to push it back to a March or June release. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1948425/mac-studio-m2-max-review.html\">current Mac Studio</a>, released in June 2023, features an M2 Max or M2 Ultra chip. It is presumed that Apple will outfit the new Mac Studio with M4 Max and M4 Ultra chips since the company is phasing out the M3 series. The rescheduling will mean the Mac Studio will go two years between updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman reports that an M4 Mac Pro is still in the works but offered no updates on its release schedule. Gurman had previously <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2426453/m4-processor-mac-mini-studio-pro-imac-macbook-air.html\">reported</a> that the M4 Mac Pro could be available in late 2025 or at WWDC in June at the earliest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the first half of 2025 isn’t just for the Mac. Gurman reports that for the “spring product release cycle,” Apple plans to release “a revamped iPhone SE, fresh iPad Air models and upgraded iPad keyboards” as well as the 11th-generation iPad. As heavily rumored, the iPhone SE will represent a complete redesign for the budget phone, with an iPhone 14-style design, Apple Intelligence support, and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2478796/leak-claims-the-iphone-se-4-will-have-an-apple-made-5g-modem.html\">first Apple-design modem</a>. The 11th-gen iPad and iPad Air updates will likely be smaller spec bumps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To catch up on all the rumors, check out the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">M4 MacBook Air: Everything you need to know</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">M4 Mac Studio: Everything you need to know</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320613/m3-m4-ultra-mac-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">M4 Ultra Mac Pro: Everything you need to know</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE 4: Everything you need to know about Apple’s next budget phone</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303108/m4-macbook-pro-release-date-price-specs-rumors.html\">M4 MacBook Pro: Everything you need to know</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2423527/m4-imac-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">M4 iMac: Everything you need to know</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">M4 Mac mini: Everything you need to know</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"18296b87cb81e6c0e045e2621cdaae5bb175e86cbb1c7dff420bdb6d2759a784","category":"Apple"}
