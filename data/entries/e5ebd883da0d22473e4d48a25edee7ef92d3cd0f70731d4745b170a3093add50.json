Shortly after, 1UP started making its own vertical carry hitch rack, which they creatively named the Recon. I <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/1up-recon-rack-review/\" target=\"_blank\">tested the five-bike version</a> of the outgoing Recon and loved it. It was easy enough to use, versatile, and seemingly indestructible. It was also obnoxiously heavy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Wisconsin-based bike rack manufacturer 1UP-USA launches a completely redesigned Recon Vertical Hitch Rack. 1UP says the new Recon Rack “<em>represents a full overhaul from the hitch up.</em>” </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1UP USA Recon Rack redesigned, lighter than ever!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Recon was built around the company’s ethos that gear should be repaired, not replaced. As such, it has a more modular design that aims to enhance serviceability and repair. The new Recon is also claimed to be 15% lighter and includes a handful of user-friendly upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>We tasked our world-class engineers with reimagining the Recon to embody the durability, serviceability, and versatility that 1UP customers expect,</em>” said Kurt Barclay, Marketing Director at 1UP-USA. “<em>The result is a rack that sets a new benchmark for performance and longevity in vertical bike transport</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6206.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1228\" height=\"691\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6206-edited.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6206-edited.webp 1228w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6206-edited-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6206-edited-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6206-edited-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6206-edited-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Loaded up with the redesigned 1UP Recon. <em>(All photos/1UP-USA)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 Recon Highlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>15% Weight Reduction</strong>: The 2025 Recon features a combined aluminum and steel construction that cuts unnecessary weight without sacrificing ruggedness. The 4-bike configuration now weighs just 72 pounds, while the 5- and 6-bike models come in at 80 pounds and 84 pounds, respectively. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fully Bolt-Together Design</strong>: Gone are the welds. The new modular frame is fully serviceable and swappable, ensuring every component can be replaced or repaired, not tossed. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wedge-Style Hitch Connection</strong>: The newly integrated wedge hitch locks the rack into place, eliminating sway and rattle for a rock-solid ride every time. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Upgraded Pivot System</strong>: A redesigned tilt mechanism with a heavy-duty pin and easy-access lever makes it simpler than ever to get into the back of your vehicle, even when fully loaded. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>New Aluminum Baskets</strong>: The symmetrical baskets are lighter and compatible with a wider range of bikes, including MTB, gravel, and fat tires, without the need for adapters. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Now Available in 4, 5, and 6-Bike Options</strong>: For the first time, the Recon is available in a 4-bike configuration, offering more flexibility for families and shuttle crews alike. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>APS Side Panel Compatibility</strong>: The Recon works seamlessly with 1UP’s APS (Accessory Panel System) Side Panel, allowing users to mount tools, gas, water, and other essentials right to the rack — ideal for trail builders and overlanders.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6165.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6165.webp\" alt=\"close-up of the replaceable machined aluminum rear tire cradles on the new 1UP-USA Recon Rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6165.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6165-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6165-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6165-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6165-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6165-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6165-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The machined aluminum rear tire cradles help reduce weight, are replaceable, and look easier to use, compared to the previous version.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the highlights listed above, the weight reduction is the one I’m most excited about. The mixed aluminum and steel construction drops the weight by roughly 15%, which addresses my main complaint about the previous all-steel version. The 5-bike Recon I tested weighed 92 pounds on my scale, while the new version weighs a claimed 80 pounds. It’s still heavy, but that’s a significant difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of aluminum parts and the fully bolt-together design also enhances its serviceability and should make it easier to repair if/when needed. For example, the lower crossbar, including the tire cradles, on the previous Recon was cut from a single piece of steel. The new Recon uses replaceable machined aluminum tire cradles. Not only does this contribute to the weight reduction, but it also appears to be much easier to loop the rear tire strap around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6172.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6172.webp\" alt=\"The redsigned, symmetrical front wheel baskets on the 1UP Recon\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6172.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6172-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6172-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6172-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6172-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6172-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6172-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The redesigned, symmetrical front wheel baskets are different and should work with a large range of wheel and tire sizes.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The symmetrical design of the front wheel baskets is also new and somewhat novel. While most wheel baskets are angled to one side or the other, this open, symmetrical style lets you choose. More importantly, 1UP claims they are compatible with wheels from 24 to 29 inches and tires up to 5 inches wide. This should eliminate the need for different-sized baskets for kids’ bikes or fat bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1UP also did away with the “Smooth Pivot Operation” and the oversized pivot carried over from the original pre-1UP Recon Racks and replaced it with what looks like a simpler and lighter design. The tilt mechanism’s “heavy-duty pin” and “easy access lever” look sturdy and relatively easy to access when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6244.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6244.webp\" alt=\"The updated pivot and tilt mechanism on the 1UP Recon\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6244.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6244-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6244-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6244-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6244-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6244-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6244-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The updated pivot and tilt mechanism.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like most vertical carry racks, the new Recon only comes in a 2-inch receiver size, and a welcome addition is the wedge-style hitch connection. Hopefully, this eliminates any play in the receiver and enhances the rack’s stability. Even with a solid anti-wobble system, fully loaded vertical carry racks can be prone to some side-to-side movement. So, 1UP added attachment points for stabilizing straps to the 2025 Recon, and it comes with a set. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the product page on 1UP’s website, the support straps are recommended when using the Recon off-road. On that note, the rack is rated for off-road use, and the 4-bike version is also rated for use on RVs (with support straps).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously only offered in five and six-bike configurations, the addition of the four-bike version gives consumers more options. One thing that hasn’t changed, however, is the 45-pound per bike weight limit. While that’s plenty for most non-electric mountain, gravel, and lightweight eMTBs, the full-power eMTB crowd will still want to look elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6135.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1739\" height=\"1158\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6135.webp\" alt=\"The 1UP Recon rack on a vehicle with several bike loaded.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6135.webp 1739w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6135-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6135-1536x1023.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6135-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6135-768x511.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6135-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Recon-6135-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Recon racks, in 4, 5, and 6-bike versions, sell for $1,100, $1,300, and $1,500, respectively. That’s not cheap, but if you do the math, they are among the most affordable ways to transport four to six bikes at a time on a rack. Tray-style <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-hitch-bike-racks/\" target=\"_blank\">hitch bike racks</a> with add-ons max out at four bikes and often exceed the price of the 4-bike Recon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all 1UP-USA products, the redesigned Recon is proudly made in the USA. The 2025 Recon is available now and sold exclusively on 1UP-USA’s website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://1up-usa.com/product/recon-rack\" target=\"_blank\">1up-USA.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/1up-usa-launches-redesigned-recon-rack/\">1UP USA Launches Redesigned Recon Rack that’s 15% Lighter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e5ebd883da0d22473e4d48a25edee7ef92d3cd0f70731d4745b170a3093add50","category":"Cycling"}
