{"title":"MacOS 15 Sequoia Adds Weekly — That’s Right, Weekly — Nagging Permission Prompts for Screenshot and Screen Recording Apps","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/06/macos-sequoia-screen-recording-privacy-prompt/","date":1723084097000,"content":"\n<p>Chance Miller, writing for 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With macOS Sequoia this fall, using apps that need access to\nscreen recording permissions will become a little bit more\ntedious. Apple is rolling out a change that will require you to\ngive explicit permission on a weekly basis to these types of apps,\nand every time you reboot your Mac. [...] In the current macOS\nSequoia beta, this prompt says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“[App name] can access this computer’s screen and audio. Do you\nwant to continue to allow access? This application may be able to\ncollect information from any open applications on your desktop\nwhile the app is running.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Users can then choose to “Continue To Allow” that app to have\nscreen recording access, or they can click “Open System Settings”\nand immediately be taken to the preferences pane for screen\nrecording permissions.</p>\n\n<p>This prompt is designed to appear on a weekly basis. The first\ntime you attempt to use the app each week, you’ll see this prompt\nand have to decide whether to “Continue To Allow” or change the\npermission settings. The prompt will also appear each time (for\neach app) when you use that app for the first time after rebooting\nyour Mac.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think it shows just how much care and thoughtfulness went into turning up the dial on these nags that the button label <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/applestyleguide/c-apsgb744e4a3/web\">incorrectly capitalizes the “to”</a> in “Continue To Allow”. You can say, well, that’s a little thing. But that’s exactly the sort of little thing that almost never shipped from Apple, even in beta, until the last few years.</p>\n\n<p>Having to click through these confirmation nags every week, for every such utility you use, is not a little thing at all. It’s the sort of thing companies do when decisions like this are made by people looking to cover their asses, not make insanely great products.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/07/macos-15-sequoia-weekly-permission-prompts\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"198c9087d3e1528b1d264a2cba805df77c231947bd2b3b9b3355848c6d8601e1","category":"Tech"}
