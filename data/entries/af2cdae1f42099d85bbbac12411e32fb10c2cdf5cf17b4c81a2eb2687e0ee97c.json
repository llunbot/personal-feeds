You can pass a well-maintained Submariner down to your progeny. You can generally sell a Nomos or an Omega long after you purchase it, often at a profit. Or you can simply keep it on your wrist as a reminder of the inexorable march of time, the importance of punctuality, and the genius of so many tiny mechanical pieces working together toward one simple but crucial function.</p>\n<p>This will not happen with the first Apple Watch Edition models, despite Jony Ive's <a href=\"https://www.wareable.com/apple/jony-ive-fashion-accessory-report-apple-watch-7361\">strong desire to enter that realm</a>. As of September 30, Apple moved the original Apple Watch models to its \"obsolete\" list, at least internally. That includes the \"Edition\" models that ranged from $10,000 to $17,000 at their April 2015 launch. When a product is \"obsolete,\" Apple no longer offers parts, repairs, or other replacement services for it.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972795#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972795&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"af2cdae1f42099d85bbbac12411e32fb10c2cdf5cf17b4c81a2eb2687e0ee97c","category":"Tech"}
