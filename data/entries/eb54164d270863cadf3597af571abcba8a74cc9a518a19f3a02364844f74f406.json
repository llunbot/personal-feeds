These miniature spacecraft provide so-called last-mile service and are particularly useful for satellites that launch as a part of rideshare missions and seek to reach a different altitude or inclination than that of the primary payload.</p>\n<p>However these space logistics vehicles, offered by a variety of companies, such as D-Orbit, Momentus, Launcher, and several others, generally are designed for satellites with a mass of a few dozen to a few hundred kilograms.</p>\n<p>What has been lacking so far is a larger in-space tug that can haul bigger satellites to more distant orbits. That's the market that a new spacecraft built by Impulse Space, Helios, intends to serve.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996443#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996443&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eb54164d270863cadf3597af571abcba8a74cc9a518a19f3a02364844f74f406","category":"Tech"}
