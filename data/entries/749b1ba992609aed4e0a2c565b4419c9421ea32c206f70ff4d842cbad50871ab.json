Most of us just haven't created a complex set of APIs and brokered deals across regulation and industry to hold onto the essential essence of cookies.

The very short version is that Google had a \"path,\" <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html\">first announced in January 2020</a>, to turn off third-party (i.e. tracking) cookies in the most-used browser on Earth, bringing it in line with Safari, Firefox, and many other browsers. Google has proposed a number of alternatives to the cookies that follow you from page to page, constantly pitching you on that space heater you looked at three days ago. Each of these alternatives has met varying amounts of resistance from privacy and open web advocates, trade regulators, and the advertising industry.</p>\n<p>So rather than turn off third-party cookies by default and implement new solutions inside the Privacy Sandbox, Chrome will \"introduce a new experience\" that lets users choose their tracking preferences when they update or first use Chrome. Google will also keep working on its Privacy Sandbox APIs but in a way that recognizes the \"impact on publishers, advertisers, and everyone involved in online advertising.\" Google also did not fail to mention it was \"discussing this new path with regulators.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038576#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038576&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"749b1ba992609aed4e0a2c565b4419c9421ea32c206f70ff4d842cbad50871ab","category":"Tech"}
