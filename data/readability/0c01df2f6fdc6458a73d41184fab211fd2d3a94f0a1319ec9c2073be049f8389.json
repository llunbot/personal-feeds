The show’s conceit is to conceal the identity of the celebrity singers beneath elaborate costumes, with the losing singer from each week forced to remove their mask.</p><p>If you are in the market for an illegal video rip of Nairo’s entire performance, some everyday hero in Bogotá has come through with the goods. It’s in Spanish, a language which I do not speak, but that fact did not negatively impact my sense of childlike wonder:</p><figure><p></p></figure><p>Quintana, who is not widely known for his dancing chops or extroversion, failed to win over judges and voting public alike and was the first celebrity evicted from the show.</p><p>The day prior to the show going to air, Quintana finished 11th at il Lombardia. He was not jetlagged to oblivion during his performance; rather, the show was pre-filmed, and then delayed for months due to a cocaine-trafficking scandal involving the husband of one of the jury members.</p><p>After being ousted from the show, Quintana said that he was “happy to be here. Very happy to be sharing the stage with all these celebrities. Happy because all the people who show me their affection (…) I have also given everything I could for my country and for my people. We continue forward.”</p><p>Quintana also alleged that, due to his costume, he “sweated more than on the bicycle.”</p><blockquote><p>WHAT.
