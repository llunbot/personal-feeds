{"title":"An Apple TV Refresh is Coming in 2025 - Here's What You Should Know","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/05/apple-tv-2025-whats-coming/","date":1738779439000,"content":"Apple hasn't refreshed the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> since 2022, but rumors suggest that we're finally going to get an update in 2025. We don't have a full picture of what to expect yet, but we have some hints on what's coming.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\n<h2>Updated A-Series Chip</h2>\r<br />\nThe current ‌Apple TV‌ 4K uses the A15 Bionic chip that was in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 13 lineup, and it's time for an update. Apple doesn't design chips specifically for the ‌Apple TV‌, and it instead uses chips from the ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf Apple wants to bring <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> features to the ‌Apple TV‌, the next-generation model will have the A17 Pro or better along with at least 8GB RAM.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Apple Intelligence‌ makes sense for the ‌Apple TV‌ given that part of ‌Apple Intelligence‌ is a new, smarter version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>. ‌Siri‌ has always been a specific focus on the ‌Apple TV‌, with Apple encouraging users to ask ‌Siri‌ to find content to watch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe A17 Pro would also allow for higher-quality console-style games because it supports hardware-accelerated ray tracing. The ‌iPhone‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> can support console games like Resident Evil 4 and Death Stranding, and those games are also likely to be playable on the next ‌Apple TV‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Wi-Fi 6E</h2>\r<br />\nApple is expected to use a custom Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip for the ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ 4K. The chip will support Wi-Fi 6E, which will allow the ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ to connect to faster 6GHz networks when available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRight now, Apple offers both a Wi-Fi only ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ 4K and a Wi-Fi + Ethernet model, and that could continue with the next-generation model. We could also see the next ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ adopt Bluetooth 5.3.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ is expected to continue to offer Thread integration and support for Matter when used as a home hub for smart home products. Wi-Fi 6E could theoretically improve connectivity for smart home products because the 6GHz band typically has reduced signal interference and more bandwidth.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Design</h2>\r<br />\nIt's looking like Apple has no plans to redesign the ‌Apple TV‌. We're not expecting form factor updates, and the next-generation ‌Apple TV‌ will continue to feature the same slimmed-down black plastic body that the current model uses.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\r<br />\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has been saying that Apple might debut a cheaper ‌Apple TV‌, and that under $100 would be the \"sweet spot.\" Apple may lower prices on the new model, but it's more likely that the current version will stick around and be sold at a discount.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current ‌Apple TV‌ starts at $129 for 64GB of storage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Launch Date</h2>\r<br />\nWe're expecting the ‌Apple TV‌ to see a refresh sometime in late 2025, likely in September or October.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/05/apple-tv-2025-whats-coming/\">An Apple TV Refresh is Coming in 2025 - Here's What You Should Know</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/an-apple-tv-refresh-is-coming-in-2025-heres-what-you-should-know.2448836/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d2f7704e021452726ff8ba6f786cfe96ad83649a8a2e0375c23bf80c708692ab","category":"Apple"}
