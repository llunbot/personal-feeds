It also lowered its minimum order quantities to just one item.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with competition from longer-established custom manufacturers – such as Cuore and Champion System – Rapha was not the only kit brand jostling for consumer spend, and its pricepoint was typically higher than its competitors’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a press release announcing the closure, Rapha said that “despite our best efforts, we have struggled to deliver an experience, both digitally and physically, that our customers, local teams and communities expect from the Rapha brand.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rapha-Custom-feature-img-1340x838.jpg\" /><figcaption>Rapha says more than 2,200 teams were kitted out by Rapha Custom over the life of the program.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has historically had more hits than misses, so it’s nonetheless a little surprising to see it stepping away from an entire market segment – especially after what was presumably a significant investment to get it up in the first place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to questions from CyclingTips, a representative from Rapha elaborated further: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><em>“An announcement went up on our website yesterday, and we are in the process of communicating with our customers regarding the news.  <br /><br />“We are proud of what the Custom team and the wider business has achieved over the past two years but we are sorry to say that there will be some impact on the teams. We are going through a period of consultation as we discuss roles and reporting line changes. There are up to three roles facing redundancy.”</em></p><p></p></blockquote>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/raphas-custom-division-has-been-shut-down/\">Read More</a>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"e8b0d66102a702033b357293040b5a9c0034b7f1197fb07e134d4682e0d82de2","category":"Cycling"}
