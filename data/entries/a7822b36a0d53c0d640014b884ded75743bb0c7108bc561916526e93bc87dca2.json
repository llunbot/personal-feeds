The report claims that one of the key features of the new ‌iPad mini‌ will be the A15 chip, which is expected to debut in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> lineup later this year. The A15 is expected to be made with the same 5nm fabrication process as the A14 chip, and Apple is said to be working on a more powerful \"A15X\" variant for other <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> models set to launch at a later date.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs previously reported by the leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/\">Jon Prosser</a>, the sixth-generation ‌iPad mini‌ will also have a USB-C port instead of the current model's Lightning port to open it up to a wider range of peripherals and accessories, bringing it in line with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe other major upgrade claimed to be arriving with the new ‌iPad mini‌ is a ‌Smart Connector‌, as previously shown on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/\">Jon Prosser's renders</a> of the device that were purportedly based on leaked images. The report says that Apple is planning to release ‌Smart Connector‌ accessories for the new ‌iPad mini‌, but it is not clear what these may be.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSeparately, the report also stated that the entry-level ‌iPad‌, reportedly codenamed \"J181,\" is set to receive an update with the A13 chip from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> lineup. The current model features the A12 chip, meaning that the A13 could give the device a significant performance boost.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/12/sixth-generation-ipad-mini-this-fall/\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> has said that the new ‌iPad mini‌ is expected to launch this fall, and despite a range of inconsistent rumors around the device, most reports seem to have agreed on the device featuring a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/14/kuo-apple-glasses-2022-new-ipads-2020/\">larger display</a> in the region of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/ipad-mini-6-slim-bezels-march-launch/\">8.4-inches</a> with slimmer bezels and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/12/sixth-generation-ipad-mini-this-fall/\">iPad Air-style redesign</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini 5</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/9to5mac-com/\">9to5mac.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/ipad-mini-6-a15-chip-and-smart-connector/\">iPad Mini 6 Rumored to Feature A15 Chip and Smart Connector</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-6-rumored-to-feature-a15-chip-and-smart-connector.2304871/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZVAiN3kHF2A:NDCY4bvHpek:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZVAiN3kHF2A:NDCY4bvHpek:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ZVAiN3kHF2A\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a7822b36a0d53c0d640014b884ded75743bb0c7108bc561916526e93bc87dca2","category":"Apple"}
