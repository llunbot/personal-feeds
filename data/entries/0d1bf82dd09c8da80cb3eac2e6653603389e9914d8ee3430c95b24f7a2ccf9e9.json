The feature can currently be used with only a single Mac display, but analyst <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/the-apple-vision-pro/\">Ben Thompson today suggested</a> that Apple has internally tested the ability to use multiple displays.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Vision-Pro-Mac-Virtual-Display.jpg\" width=\"1178\" height=\"663\" />\r<br />\n\"I have heard through the grapevine that Vision Pro users at Apple headquarters can project two Mac screens,\" said Thompson, in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/the-apple-vision-pro/\">his review of the headset</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple engineers have access to future visionOS versions, and feature flags that enable extra functionality, so this revelation is certainly believable. However, it's unclear if Apple plans to let the public use the feature with multiple displays.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor now, if your Mac has external displays connected to it, the Vision Pro only shows the main display that you have set in the Mac's System Settings app. While the Vision Pro is showing a Mac's display, the computer's built-in display and any external monitors that are connected to it appear black and cannot be used during that time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature is compatible with any Mac running macOS Sonoma, but the maximum display resolution is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/03/apple-vision-pro-can-display-intel-macs/\">limited to 3K for Intel-based Macs</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/vision-pro-virtual-display-multiple-macs/\">Apple Engineers Allegedly Able to Use Vision Pro With Two Mac Displays</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-engineers-allegedly-able-to-use-vision-pro-with-two-mac-displays.2418652/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0d1bf82dd09c8da80cb3eac2e6653603389e9914d8ee3430c95b24f7a2ccf9e9","category":"Apple"}
