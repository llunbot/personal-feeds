For example, in January-March 2024 Brazil and South Korean students could claim free AirPods with purchases, but Australian and New Zealand students were given Apple gift vouchers. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673191/apple-back-school-sale.html\">Apple’s Back To School offer</a> kicked off in June 2024 in the U.S. where students are able to get vouchers with qualifying purchases until mid-September. In Europe and the U.K. the same offer will start in mid-July and will run until October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students can also get <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674847/students-can-get-apple-tv-free-with-half-price-apple-music.html\">Apple Music for half price</a> with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673723/how-to-get-apple-tv-plus-free.html\">free Apple TV+</a> included.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How much is the Apple student discount?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple doesn’t offer a single, universal discount to students. It sets different prices for each product range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students can save up to $200/£220 on Macs and up to $100/£100 on iPads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how the iPad MSRP compares to the student price: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Product</strong></th><th>U.S.</th><th>U.K.</th><th>Australia</th><th>Canada</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>iPad (10th gen) MSRP</td><td>$349</td><td>£349</td><td>$599</td><td>$499</td></tr><tr><td>iPad (10th gen) Student Price</td><td>$329</td><td>£329</td><td>$559</td><td>$469</td></tr><tr><td>iPad mini MSRP</td><td>$499</td><td>£499</td><td>$829</td><td>$679</td></tr><tr><td>iPad mini Student Price</td><td><br />$449<br /></td><td>£449</td><td>$749</td><td>$609</td></tr><tr><td>iPad Air (11-inch, M2) MSRP</td><td>$599</td><td>£599</td><td>$999</td><td>$799</td></tr><tr><td>iPad Air (11-inch, M2) Student Price</td><td>$549</td><td>£549</td><td>$919</td><td>$729</td></tr><tr><td>iPad Air (13-inch, M2)<br />MSRP</td><td>$799</td><td>£799</td><td>$1,299</td><td>$1,099</td></tr><tr><td>iPad Air (13-inch, M2) Student Price</td><td>$749</td><td>£749</td><td>$1,219</td><td>$1,029</td></tr><tr><td>iPad Pro (11-inch, M4) MSRP</td><td>$999</td><td>£999</td><td>$1,699</td><td>$1,399</td></tr><tr><td>iPad Pro (11-inch, M4) Student Price</td><td>$899</td><td>£899</td><td>$1,529</td><td>$1,249</td></tr><tr><td>iPad Pro (13-inch, M4) MSRP</td><td>$1,299</td><td>£1,299</td><td>$2,199</td><td>$1,799</td></tr><tr><td>iPad Pro (13-inch, M4) Student Price</td><td>$1,199</td><td>£1,199</td><td>$2,029</td><td>$1,649</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Apple’s discounted price for students compared to the usual price.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how the Mac MSRP compares to the student price: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Product</strong></th><th>U.S.</th><th>U.K.</th><th>Australia</th><th>Canada</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>13.6-inch MacBook Air, M2, MSRP</td><td>$999</td><td>£999</td><td>$1,599</td><td>$1,299</td></tr><tr><td>13.6-inch MacBook Air, M2, Student discount</td><td>$899</td><td>£899</td><td>$1,439</td><td>$1,169</td></tr><tr><td>13.6-inch MacBook Air, M3, MSRP</td><td>$1,099</td><td>£1,099</td><td>$1,799</td><td>$1,449</td></tr><tr><td>13.6-inch MacBook Air, M3, Student discount</td><td>$999</td><td>£999</td><td>$1,649</td><td>$1,299</td></tr><tr><td>15-inch MacBook Air, M3, MSRP</td><td>$1,299</td><td>£1,299</td><td>$2,199</td><td>$1,749</td></tr><tr><td>15-inch MacBook Air, M3, Student discount</td><td>$1,199</td><td>£1,199</td><td>$1,999</td><td>$1,599</td></tr><tr><td>14-inch MacBook Pro M3 MSRP</td><td>$1,599</td><td>£1,699</td><td>$2,699</td><td>$2,099</td></tr><tr><td>14-inch MacBook Pro M3 Student discount</td><td>$1,499</td><td>£1,589</td><td>$2,529</td><td>$1,969</td></tr><tr><td>14-inch MacBook Pro, M3 Pro MSRP</td><td>$1,999</td><td>£2,099</td><td>$3,499</td><td>$2,699</td></tr><tr><td>14-inch MacBook Pro, M3 Pro Student discount</td><td>$1,849</td><td>£1,939</td><td>$3,239</td><td>$2,399</td></tr><tr><td>16-inch MacBook Pro, M3 Pro MSRP</td><td>$2,499</td><td>£2,599</td><td>$4,299</td><td>$3,299</td></tr><tr><td>16-inch MacBook Pro, M3 Pro Student discount</td><td>$2,299</td><td>£2,389</td><td>$3,949</td><td>$2,939</td></tr><tr><td>iMac M3 MSRP</td><td>$1,299</td><td>£1,399</td><td>$2,199</td><td>$1,699</td></tr><tr><td>iMac M3 Student discount</td><td>$1,249</td><td>£1,349</td><td>$2,109</td><td>$1,629</td></tr><tr><td>Mac mini MSRP</td><td>$599</td><td>£649</td><td>$999</td><td>$799</td></tr><tr><td>Mac mini Student discount</td><td>$499</td><td>£539</td><td>$829</td><td>$669</td></tr><tr><td>Mac Studio MSRP</td><td>$1,999</td><td>£2,099</td><td>$3,299</td><td>$2,699</td></tr><tr><td>Mac Studio Student discount</td><td>$1,799</td><td>£1,889</td><td>$2,969</td><td>$2,429</td></tr><tr><td>Mac Pro MSRP</td><td>$6,999</td><td>£7,199</td><td>$11,999</td><td>$8,999</td></tr><tr><td>Mac Pro Student discount</td><td>$6,599</td><td>£6,789</td><td>$11,309</td><td>$8,479</td></tr><tr><td><br /></td><td><br /></td><td><br /></td><td><br /></td><td><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Apple’s discounted price for students compared to the usual price.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>MacBook student discounts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are the discounts on the base model Macs, there are bigger discounts on the more expensive models.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3466634/lifestyle_kids_home_learning_11.jpg\" alt=\"MacBook University\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"MacBook University\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"MacBook University\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How much can students save on the 13-inch MacBook Air, M2?

Do you qualify for Apple’s student discounts? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to shop at Apple’s Education Stores and take advantage of the lower prices you need to qualify as a student or work in an education institution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were hoping that you could get a discount for the Mac you want to buy your 13-year-old the bad news is that you can’t, unless you are employed by the school and buying for the institution, or you are a home educator. Students in high school don’t qualify for this discount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three types of people who can qualify for a student discount:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Students in higher education (post-secondary education, e.g. university, college).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>People who are buying for education institutions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Parents of higher education students buying on their behalf.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Home-based educators. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple spells this out in more detail in its terms and conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the U.S. these state that the following groups are “eligible to purchase from the Apple Store for Education:”</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>K-12</strong> <strong>staff</strong>: Any employee of a public or private K-12 institution in the United States is eligible, including homeschool teachers (this doesn’t include people educating their children during lockdowns). In addition, school board members who are currently serving as elected or appointed members are eligible. PTA or PTO executives currently serving as elected or appointed officers are eligible.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Higher education staff and students</strong>: Faculty and staff of higher educational institutions in the U.S.; and students attending, or accepted into a higher educational institution in the U.S. are eligible to purchase. Purchases from the Apple Store for Education Individuals are not for institutional purchase or resale.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Higher education parents</strong>: Parents purchasing on behalf of their child, who is a student currently attending or accepted into a public or private higher educational institution in the U.S. are eligible to purchase.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has a similar set of terms and conditions for eligibility in the U.K.:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Employees of any education institution</strong>: Any employee of a public or private education institution in the U.K.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Post-secondary education students</strong>: Students attending or accepted into a post-secondary education institution in the U.K.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Parents of post-secondary students</strong>: Parents purchasing on behalf of their child, who is a student currently attending or accepted into a public or private post-secondary education institution in the U.K.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re attending higher education, or have been accepted into a higher education/post-secondary institution, you qualify for an Apple discount. (In the U.K. post-secondary means university, or any other formal education that takes place after secondary education is complete. Therefore, this excludes sixth-form colleges, although it may be worth inquiring at an Apple Store to see if the company is prepared to relax the rules.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents of post-secondary/higher education students do not qualify when buying for themselves, but they can pick up a discounted Mac for their child from the education store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anybody who works in an educational environment qualifies for a discount on certain Apple products. It’s not just limited to teachers and lecturers but also covers administrative workers and other staff members. Essentially, it’s anybody who works at or for a school, college, or university. (This is not limited to post-secondary institutions. Apple refers to “any education institution.”)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This does mean that you can’t get a discount for a Mac or iPad for your child who is currently at school, although the school could make the purchase and provide the equipment for students. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t qualify for an Apple Education Store discount, we’d recommend instead checking out the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Refurbished Store</a>, which offers discounts for everyone. You can’t apply a student discount in Apple’s Refurbished Store. We also recommend that you check our round-ups of the latest and best <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/deals\">Apple deals</a> we find at various Apple resellers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How many products can I buy?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/open/salespolicies\" target=\"_blank\">this Sales Policy document</a> (<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://tinyurl.com/mss9bsvh&amp;xcust=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">or here</a>) on the U.S. Apple site and the same on the <a href=\"https%3A%2F%2Fapple.sjv.io%2Fc%2F321564%2F435298%2F7615&amp;subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">U.K. Apple Education site</a>, students can purchase the following with education pricing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Desktop Mac: One may be purchased per year</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Laptop Mac: One may be purchased per year</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad: Two may be purchased per year</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Accessories: Two accessories with Education Pricing may be purchased per year</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get a student discount at Apple</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having established that you qualify for an education discount, how can you get money off at Apple?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may think that all you need to do is visit the Apple Store for Education and you will find the products you want at a lower price. However, before you can access Apple’s Education Store you will need to verify that you are a student or that you qualify in another way (e.g. you work in a school or college). Different countries have different sequences of steps to go through, which we will run through below. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to get an Apple student discount in the U.S.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a student in the U.S. it is quite easy to get an Education discount at the U.S. Apple Store–in fact, a loophole may mean it is possible to get a student discount without any proof that you are a student. If you are a student you should follow these steps: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Visit <a href=\"https%3A%2F%2Fapple.sjv.io%2Fc%2F321564%2F435031%2F7613%3FsubId1%3D1-1-670705-1-0-0%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.apple.com%252Fus-edu%252Fshop&amp;subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/store\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s U.S. Education Store</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose the Mac or iPad you want and click on your selection. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once you have customized your Apple product, click <em>Continue</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enter your delivery details and check out. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Beware that Apple can request to see evidence that you are a student at any point during or after the purchase and will charge an additional fee if you fail to provide it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any problems, we recommend you get your student status verified with <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.myunidays.com/US/en-US/partners/appleeducationstore/spotlight/online&amp;xcust=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">UNiDAYS</a> or log on from your university network. Make sure you have quick access to some form of official identification that proves you qualify for the education discount. Your student ID is a good choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2022, Apple changed the U.S. Education Discount Store to require validation from UNiDAYS before students can get a discount, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/606352/apple-removes-unidays-verification-education-store.html\">but it then removed the requirement</a>. Apple could re-implement this validation step that students in other countries have to go through. If it does it may still be possible for non-students in the U.S. to avoid the validation step, as per this <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/s7g5t6/apple_education_store_now_requires_unidays_and/&amp;xcust=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canadian students can follow the same steps as the U.S. Start shopping at <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/ca_edu_93120/store\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s Canada Education Store</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to get an Apple student discount in the U.K.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>U.K. students will need to register with UNiDAYS before they can get a discount from the Apple Education Store. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Visit <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/campaigns/education-pricing\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s U.K. Education Store</a> to access the Apple Education site.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once there you’ll be encouraged to sign up on the student discount website <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.myunidays.com&amp;xcust=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">UNiDAYS</a>.
