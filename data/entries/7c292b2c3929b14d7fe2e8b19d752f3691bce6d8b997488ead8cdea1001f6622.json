DT Swiss says the new wheels are optimised for 28mm tyres.</p>\n<p>According to DT Swiss’s wind tunnel testing, the new ERC 1100 DICUT 35 and ERC 1100 DICUT 45 (fitted with 700x28c <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/continental-gp5000-tl-tyre-review/\">Continental GP5000 TL</a> tyres) outperform key competitors such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/zipp-303-s/\">Zipp 303S</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/hunt-ud-carbon-spoke-disc/\">Hunt Carbon 44 Disc</a> and Vision Metron 44 DB by a margin of one to two watts, depending on the yaw angle.</p>\n<p>Small margins, undoubtedly, but nice to have if the claims stand up to scrutiny.</p>\n<h2>VU-shape rims, new hubs and new spokes</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new rim profile uses a VU shape, as first seen on DT Swiss’s ARC DICUT aero wheels.</span></figcaption><span> <i>simon.bromley@immediate.co.uk</i></span></div>\n<p>In a nod to its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/dt-swiss-arc-dicut-1100-1400/\">ARC DICUT</a> wheel range, DT Swiss says the new rim profile has been formed with its Aero+ design philosophy in mind.</p>\n<p>As well as optimising them for the wider tyres many road cyclists are now using, DT Swiss says improving handling stability and reducing aerodynamic drag were key objectives.</p>\n<p>Just like the ARC DICUT wheels, these latest ERC DICUT wheels move away from a U-shape rim to a more VU-shape, with a wide rim and a slightly pointier trailing edge than before.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> DT Swiss says the ERC 1100 DICUT 45 wheels produce less aerodynamic drag than its key competitors.</span></figcaption><span> <i>DT Swiss</i></span></div>\n<p>DT Swiss says this new rim profile results in a wheelset that not only bests its competitors in terms of aerodynamic drag, but also reduces what it calls the “steering moment” – which it defines as “the physical counterforce he or she [the rider] must exert in order to keep the wheel in position when it is hit by crosswinds” – by 20 per cent compared to a 50mm-deep ARC DICUT wheel.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Handling stability on the ERC 1100 DICUT 45 wheelset is claimed to be 20 per cent better than a 50mm-deep ARC DICUT wheelset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>simon.bromley@immediate.co.uk</i></span></div>\n<p>While the rims are the same on both sets, the pricier ERC 1100 DICUT wheelsets get DT Swiss 180 hubs with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/ceramic-bearings/\">ceramic bearings</a>, and DT Swiss’s latest DT Aerolite II and DT Aero Comp II aero spokes, for an additional claimed aerodynamic gain of around 1.1 watts.</p>\n<p>Again, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/from-pillows-to-pinarellos-inside-team-skys-marginal-gains-world/\">marginal gains</a>, but nice to have if the claims are to be believed.</p>\n<p>The cheaper ERC 1400 DICUT wheelsets make do with DT Swiss’s original DT Aero Comp aero spokes and DT Swiss 240 hubs with steel bearings.</p>\n<h2>Hooked rims</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> DT Swiss has stuck with a hooked rim for the new ERC DICUT wheels.</span></figcaption><span> <i>simon.bromley@immediate.co.uk</i></span></div>\n<p>Unlike many players in the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-wheels/\">road bike wheels</a> market, DT Swiss is sticking with hooked rims (as opposed to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/hookless-rims-road-tubeless/\">hookless rims</a>) for the new ERC DICUT wheels.</p>\n<p>As you’d expect, the rims are <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless</a> compatible (which is handy, given many of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">best road bike tyres</a> are tubeless-ready these days), with tubeless rim tape pre-installed and tubeless valves supplied as standard.</p>\n<p>Maintaining a hooked rim, however, means compatibility with clincher tyres is retained.</p>\n<p>DT Swiss acknowledges hooked rims are costlier and more complex to manufacture, but states it believes hooked rims offer improved safety against tyre blow-offs and increased freedom of choice when it comes to tyres.</p>\n<h2>DT Swiss ERC DICUT wheels specification, claimed weight and prices</h2>\n<p>As with the ARC DICUT wheels, each ERC DICUT wheelset ships with both <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/sram-xd-driver-body-explained/\">SRAM XDR</a> and Shimano HG compatible freehubs included in the box.</p>\n<p>We had a set of the ERC 1400 DICUT wheels to photograph, and those weighed 1,580g with rim tape installed.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n
