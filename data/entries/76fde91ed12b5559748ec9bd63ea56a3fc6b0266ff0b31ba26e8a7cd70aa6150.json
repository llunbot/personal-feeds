{"title":"SRAM Releases Cheaper, OEM-Only S-1000 Transmission Group – Travis Engel","link":"https://theradavist.com/sram-s-1000-transmission/","date":1719936374000,"content":"<p><em>The new SRAM S-1000 Transmission groupset is cheap-er, but let’s be real: there probably will never be a “cheap” electronic drivetrain. The best we can hope for is that brands will close the price gap between electronic and mechanical groupsets. It’s usually slow. Shimano took two years to bring Di2 shifting from Dura-Ace to Ultegra, and then another eleven years to bring it down to the 105 level. But SRAM seems to want to close that gap much quicker, given their rapid expansion of the Transmission group.</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Yeti-SB135-SRAM-Transmission-Review-6.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Yeti-SB135-SRAM-Transmission-Review-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Yeti-SB135-SRAM-Transmission-Review-6.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Yeti-SB135-SRAM-Transmission-Review-6.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Yeti-SB135-SRAM-Transmission-Review-6.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Yeti-SB135-SRAM-Transmission-Review-6.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Yeti-SB135-SRAM-Transmission-Review-6.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/Yeti-SB135-SRAM-Transmission-Review-6.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Transmission first dropped <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sram-eagle-transmission-stealth-brake-review/\" target=\"_blank\">in March of 2023</a> with XO, XX, and XX SL versions. Then, less than four months later, the lower-priced <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sram-gx-transmission-first-ride-review/\">GX Transmission</a> followed. Now, barely a year after that, comes S-1000, an all-new groupset in the Transmission ecosystem. There’s a lot of interesting things going on here, including the fact that most of* these parts will be OEM-only, meaning they will come specced on bikes, but you won’t be able to buy them aftermarket. And though that means we won’t be able to give you a direct price comparison, it does make sense.</p>\n<p>Going OEM-only allows brands to cut a lot of logistical fat from a part’s price point. They don’t need to package them for retail sale. No new boxes with new logos. Just plastic bags with enough protection to get them safely to a bike-assembly facility. Also, they’re going to be shipped in bulk orders with months of lead time. It’s simply a more efficient way to get parts into the supply chain. But enough of the boring stuff. Here’s what’s new about SRAM S-1000.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img width=\"3000\" height=\"3000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-S-1000-Transmission-cassette.jpg?fit=1200,3000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-S-1000-Transmission-cassette.jpg?w=3000&amp;quality=75 3000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-S-1000-Transmission-cassette.jpg?resize=1200,1200&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-S-1000-Transmission-cassette.jpg?resize=2000,2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-S-1000-Transmission-cassette.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75 150w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-S-1000-Transmission-cassette.jpg?resize=768,768&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-S-1000-Transmission-cassette.jpg?resize=1536,1536&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-S-1000-Transmission-cassette.jpg?resize=2048,2048&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<h3>SRAM S-1000 Cassette*</h3>\n<p>Although the derailleur is the star of the Transmission show, I think the cassette hides the biggest news. Although it offers the same 12-speed 10-52 range, with the same refined shift-gates as other T-Type cassettes, the S-1000 cassette works with an HG freehub body. SRAM’s NX and SX Eagle cable-actuated drivetrains have long used these cheaper, more ubiquitous hub standards to bring their costs down, but have always stopped at an 11-tooth smallest cog. Going to 10-tooth has a significant impact on usable gear range, especially for riders opting for smaller front chainrings who don’t want to sacrifice their top end.</p>\n<p>We haven’t gotten our hands on an S-1000 groupset yet, so we can’t yet explain the architecture, but SRAM says the 10-, 12-, 14-, 16-, and 18-tooth cogs are on a separate replaceable cluster. According to SRAM this is “currently” the only part of the S-1000 family that will be sold aftermarket. That doesn’t make much sense, seeing as how it’s the larger cogs that are exposed to more torque, and thus, the most wear. Hopefully, SRAM specifying “currently” means that they may make the entire cassette available aftermarket in the future, but that’s just a guess.</p>\n<p>Like previous Transmission cassettes, this new configuration also bumps the whole assembly out approximately two millimeters to play better with Transmission’s 55 mm chainline. The integration of an HG freehub does mean that those who want to upgrade to GX or XO cassettes will need to replace at least that part of their wheel, but there’s less need to given that 10-tooth cog.</p>\n<p><img width=\"4234\" height=\"2823\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-RD-S1000-EAGLE-AXS-T-TYPE-c-Side.jpg?fit=1200,2823&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-RD-S1000-EAGLE-AXS-T-TYPE-c-Side.jpg?w=4234&amp;quality=75 4234w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-RD-S1000-EAGLE-AXS-T-TYPE-c-Side.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-RD-S1000-EAGLE-AXS-T-TYPE-c-Side.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-RD-S1000-EAGLE-AXS-T-TYPE-c-Side.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-RD-S1000-EAGLE-AXS-T-TYPE-c-Side.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM-RD-S1000-EAGLE-AXS-T-TYPE-c-Side.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<h3>SRAM S-1000 Derailleur</h3>\n<p>With very similar architecture to the GX derailleur, it’s hard to say exactly what sets the S-1000 apart. Often, lower-priced derailleurs are manufactured using simpler processes. Less machining and forging, more stamping. But there’s not many details about exactly what’s different about this new derailleur. But there is a fair bit of info about what’s the same. Of course, it still replaces a UDH hanger to mount directly to the frame. But it also features the same rebuildability as the rest of the Transmission lineup. That means the pulley cage, skid plates, and two-piece outer link can be replaced if they’re damaged.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM_FC-S1000-Q174-CL55-DUB-165BLK2G34TTYPAL-c-Side.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM_FC-S1000-Q174-CL55-DUB-165BLK2G34TTYPAL-c-Side.jpg?w=3000&amp;quality=75 3000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM_FC-S1000-Q174-CL55-DUB-165BLK2G34TTYPAL-c-Side.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM_FC-S1000-Q174-CL55-DUB-165BLK2G34TTYPAL-c-Side.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM_FC-S1000-Q174-CL55-DUB-165BLK2G34TTYPAL-c-Side.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM_FC-S1000-Q174-CL55-DUB-165BLK2G34TTYPAL-c-Side.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SRAM_FC-S1000-Q174-CL55-DUB-165BLK2G34TTYPAL-c-Side.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<h3>SRAM S-1000 Crank</h3>\n<p>Most importantly, the new S-1000 crank uses the same 8-bolt chainring interface used across the rest of the Transmission group, as well as SRAM’s direct-mount road and power-meter cranks. You’ll be seeing it with steel or aluminum chainrings, and with or without the signature bash plates. It’s built for strength, so we can presume it’s heavier than the GX Transmission crankset.</p>\n<h3>Shifter?</h3>\n<p>As of now, there’s no S-1000-specific shifter or “controller” in the lineup. Presumably because there’s really no room to cut cost anywhere, so it’ll be paired with existing Eagle AXS controllers.</p>\n<p>We hope to get our hands on a bike specced with S-1000 soon, so stay tuned for ride impressions in the future.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.sram.com/en/sram\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sram-s-1000-transmission/\">SRAM Releases Cheaper, OEM-Only S-1000 Transmission Group</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Engel","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"76fde91ed12b5559748ec9bd63ea56a3fc6b0266ff0b31ba26e8a7cd70aa6150","category":"Cycling"}
