The court filing redacted key figures to protect Google's trade secrets. But Google claimed that testimony from US experts \"shrank\" the damages estimate \"considerably\" from initial estimates between $100 million and $300 million, suggesting that the current damages estimate is \"substantially less\" than what the US has paid so far in expert fees to reach those estimates.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026097#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026097&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d100206cb0f14318b01e4f7598329a271aed3a9eed7e2d42bdb78ae578e328ba","category":"Tech"}
