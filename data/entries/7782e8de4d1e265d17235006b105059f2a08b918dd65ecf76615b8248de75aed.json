I’ve been beta testing Aeronaut for months, and it’s the only interface to Bluesky I actually like. It’s a real Mac app — written mostly in AppKit, supporting all the right UI idioms and platform integrations. It’s not just the best Bluesky client I’ve seen, for any platform, but maybe the best new Mac app I’ve seen in years, period. Certainly the one whose very existence has made me happiest. Next time someone tells me no one makes good new native apps for the Mac anymore, I’m going to tell them Mikey Fucking Clarke does.</p>\n\n<p>$2/month or $15/year. A veritable bargain for an app so nice.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/28/aeronaut\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7782e8de4d1e265d17235006b105059f2a08b918dd65ecf76615b8248de75aed","category":"Tech"}
