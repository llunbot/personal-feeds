Availability in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/refurbished-m3-pro-m3-max-macbook-pro/\">began earlier this month</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg\" width=\"1440\" height=\"810\" />\r<br />\nAs usual for Apple's refurbished products, these refurbished MacBook Pro models are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the equivalent brand new models. A variety of configurations and color options are available in Canada, but inventory is currently more limited in Europe. The stock changes frequently, so check back often.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says it puts refurbished Macs through \"full functionality testing\" and a \"thorough cleaning process and inspection,\" and they are covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty and eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn our view, Apple's refurbished Macs are virtually indistinguishable from brand new ones, providing a good opportunity for savings directly from Apple. However, larger discounts are often <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">available from resellers like Amazon</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn related news, Apple began selling <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-refurbished-m3-imac/\">refurbished iMac models with the M3 chip</a> in the U.S. today.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/\">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/refurbished-m3-pro-m3-max-mbps-more-countries/\">Apple Now Selling Refurbished M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBook Pro Models in More Countries</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-selling-refurbished-m3-pro-and-m3-max-macbook-pro-models-in-more-countries.2420681/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1e0b924a4e966392e90325b904f11464b16496f04304ee2ddb58c919e9d696ba","category":"Apple"}
