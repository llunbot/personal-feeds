Nonetheless, Apple beat analysts' estimates for the quarter thanks to the company's rapidly growing services revenue.</p>\n<p>iPhone revenue dropped from $51.33 billion in the same quarter last year to $45.96 billion, a fall of about 10 percent. This was the second consecutive quarter with declining iPhone revenues. That said, investors feared a sharp drop before the earnings call.</p>\n<p>Notably, Apple's revenue in the region it dubs Greater China (which includes China, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong) fell 8 percent overall. The company fared a little better in other regions. China's economy is slowing even as China-based Huawei is taking bigger slices of the pie in the region.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021582#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021582&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"78a2916472468c8677b185889cae5fc980c4570e965a2cbf38e2075be8b7a917","category":"Tech"}
