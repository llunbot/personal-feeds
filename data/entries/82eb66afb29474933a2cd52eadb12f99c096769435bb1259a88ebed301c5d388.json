It does so with a never-before-seen method, cracking open an entirely new class of drugs that could yield more desperately needed new therapies for fighting drug-resistant infections.</p>\n<p>The findings appeared this week in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06873-0\">a pair</a> of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06799-7\">papers</a> published in Nature, which lay out the extensive drug development work conducted by researchers at Harvard University and the Swiss-based pharmaceutical company Roche.</p>\n<p>In an accompanying commentary, chemists Morgan Gugger and Paul Hergenrother of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign discussed the findings with optimism, noting that it has been more than 50 years since the Food and Drug Administration has approved a new class of antibiotics against the category of bacteria the drug targets: Gram-negative bacteria. This category—which includes gut pathogens such as <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, and the bacteria that cause chlamydia, the bubonic plague, gonorrhea, whooping cough, cholera, and typhoid, to name a few—is extraordinarily challenging to kill because it's defined by having a complex membrane structure that blocks most drugs, and it's good at accumulating other drug-resistance strategies</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994119#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994119&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"82eb66afb29474933a2cd52eadb12f99c096769435bb1259a88ebed301c5d388","category":"Tech"}
