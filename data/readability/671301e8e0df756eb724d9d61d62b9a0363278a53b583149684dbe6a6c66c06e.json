For a road rider, aerodynamics, weight, and ventilation are all primary considerations. A gravel rider usually rides a little slower on rural roads and wants to maximize ventilation, without as much focus on aerodynamics.</p><p>Road/Gravel helmets are mostly interchangeable and have the same features and design. They’re typically shallower in the rear and sides, have larger or more vents, and rarely come with a visor. Both scenarios benefit from hi-viz colors to improve the odds of drivers seeing you from a distance.

Helmets for more aggressive riding usually upgrade to&nbsp;an adjustable visor, and some add goggle integration.</p><p>However, long, slow, and/or technical climbs can build up a lot of body heat, too, so balancing ventilation with protection is a little harder here – bigger vents make it easier for rocks and sticks to poke through.

Notice how there’s deeper coverage in the rear, and even a little more over the temples? And its visor is adjustable, letting you slide your goggles under it without having to fully remove them. Most helmets in this category have a groove or clip on the rear that helps keep a goggle strap in place, too.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27164752/mountain-bike-helmets-for-enduro-downhill-riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27164752/mountain-bike-helmets-for-enduro-downhill-riding.jpg\" alt=\"example of mountain bike helmets for enduro and downhill MTB riding\" width=\"2150\" height=\"644\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27164752/mountain-bike-helmets-for-enduro-downhill-riding.jpg 2150w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27164752/mountain-bike-helmets-for-enduro-downhill-riding-297x89.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27164752/mountain-bike-helmets-for-enduro-downhill-riding-800x240.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27164752/mountain-bike-helmets-for-enduro-downhill-riding-120x36.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27164752/mountain-bike-helmets-for-enduro-downhill-riding-768x230.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27164752/mountain-bike-helmets-for-enduro-downhill-riding-1536x460.jpg 1536w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27164752/mountain-bike-helmets-for-enduro-downhill-riding-2048x613.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2150px) 100vw, 2150px\"></a></p><p><strong>Enduro, Downhill &amp; Full-Face Helmets:</strong><br>If you’re focused on the descents, like when racing enduro, or taking a lift or shuttle to the top, then you want a bigger helmet with more coverage.

If you’re climbing to the next downhill and don’t need a chin bar, go with something like this.</p><p>Next up the line are <em>convertible</em> full face helmets like the <a href=\"https://www.met-helmets.com/en/shop/mtb-helmets/enduro-helmets/parachute/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MET Parachute</a>&nbsp;(<em>above, center</em>). These have a removable chin bar that you can clip to your hydration pack for the climb up, then snap on before hitting the descent. When separated, the shell looks and feels more like a trail/all-mountain helmet, with bigger vents that make it fine for climbing. Combined, they offer similar face protection to what you’d get from a DH-level full face.</p><p>For true downhill and aggressive park riding, you’ll want a traditional one-piece full-face helmet like the <a href=\"https://leatt.com/us/shop/mtb/protection/helmets/helmet-mtb-gravity-8-0-v21-sku-1021000500-W?selected-color=5554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Leatt Gravity 8.0 V21</a>&nbsp;(<em>above, right</em>).

Especially if you can’t try on a helmet before purchasing, measuring your head is critical.</p><p>Wrap a cloth tape measure around your head just above your ears, making sure that it’s parallel to the floor.&nbsp;Helmet sizes usually are listed in centimeters and will have a range (e.g., size small = 51-54cm). If you plan to ride in the winter with a cap under your helmet, or you wear a cycling cap or buff in the summer, make sure the helmet fits with the extra layer, but not too loosely without it.

The closer you can bring the bottom of the triangle to the bottom of your ear, the better.

Rotational impact comes into play any time your head is hitting something at a non-right (not 90º) angle, which can cause your head to turn or be pulled in a non-linear direction in addition to whatever impact forces it just experienced. Meaning, if you’re not hitting something exactly straight on at a 90º angle – which would rarely happen – then you’ll have some rotational forces impacting your head.</p><p>The most common anti-rotation tech is the Multi-directional Impact Protection System (MIPS). It is a secondary layer between your scalp and the helmet, installed such that the outer shell of the helmet can slip, tilt, and rotate several degrees before that rotation reaches your head.</p><div id=\"attachment_235698\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Giro-Manifest-MIPS-Spherical-MTB-mountain-bike-helmet-new-2020-head-protection-18.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-235698\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Giro-Manifest-MIPS-Spherical-MTB-mountain-bike-helmet-new-2020-head-protection-18.jpg\" alt=\"giro manifest spherical\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Giro-Manifest-MIPS-Spherical-MTB-mountain-bike-helmet-new-2020-head-protection-18.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Giro-Manifest-MIPS-Spherical-MTB-mountain-bike-helmet-new-2020-head-protection-18-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Giro-Manifest-MIPS-Spherical-MTB-mountain-bike-helmet-new-2020-head-protection-18-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Giro-Manifest-MIPS-Spherical-MTB-mountain-bike-helmet-new-2020-head-protection-18-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Giro-Manifest-MIPS-Spherical-MTB-mountain-bike-helmet-new-2020-head-protection-18-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Giro-Manifest-MIPS-Spherical-MTB-mountain-bike-helmet-new-2020-head-protection-18-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Giro-Manifest-MIPS-Spherical-MTB-mountain-bike-helmet-new-2020-head-protection-18-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Giro-Manifest-MIPS-Spherical-MTB-mountain-bike-helmet-new-2020-head-protection-18-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-235698\">Some Giro helmets use MIPS Spherical, which replaces the internal slip liners with two layers of EPS shell that can slide and rotate over each other.</p></div><p>So, as the helmet hits the ground in a crash, it’s theoretically absorbing more rotational forces than a helmet without MIPS,&nbsp; thus reducing concussion risk.

And any of these anti-rotation add-ons will increase the cost and weight of a helmet.</p><p>Fortunately, the cost of adding MIPS and other anti-rotation techs has fallen dramatically. And any extra bit of protection you can add to a helmet is a good thing, especially when there are few if any downsides. But we share all of this because it’s important to understand that any of the helmets we recommend or list here are great helmets even if you opt for a version without MIPS.</p><p><b>Are MIPS helmets better than non-MIPS bicycle helmets?<br></b>Every helmet that tops the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/07/14/safest-bike-helmets-for-road-and-mountain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Virginia Tech rankings</a> has MIPS technology—but that does <em>NOT</em> automatically mean they are better.&nbsp;The testing Virginia Tech does is similar to how MIPS tests their helmet standards, so it makes sense that MIPS helmets would do well in this specific situation. Also, most of the brands that sent helmets in chose to send their MIPS-equipped models, so there’s a selection bias.</p><p>Most brands want to sell you their MIPS versions because they are more expensive and have a perceived benefit, so these are the models they send in for testing. So, it’s not a random selection of all helmets on the market, with or without MIPS and MIPS-like features.</p><p>These tests also do not account for hair and skin movement, and there’s no neck movement to twist or bend, which would further mitigate direct rotational forces on the head.</p><p>The takeaway? MIPS is probably a good thing, but don’t think that just because non-MIPS helmets aren’t ranked as highly on this list that they aren’t just as safe.</p><h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h2><div id=\"attachment_276684\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/28150144/price-range-comparision-for-bicycle-helmets.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-276684\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/28150144/price-range-comparision-for-bicycle-helmets.jpg\" alt=\"price range comparison for bicycle helmets\" width=\"1453\" height=\"619\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/28150144/price-range-comparision-for-bicycle-helmets.jpg 1453w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/28150144/price-range-comparision-for-bicycle-helmets-297x127.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/28150144/price-range-comparision-for-bicycle-helmets-800x341.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/28150144/price-range-comparision-for-bicycle-helmets-120x51.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/28150144/price-range-comparision-for-bicycle-helmets-768x327.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1453px) 100vw, 1453px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-276684\">The Kali Chakra Solo (left) is $50, while the POC Ventral Lite is $275. Both are great, just depends on what you’re looking for and your budget.</p></div><h3>How much should a helmet cost?</h3><p>The TL;DR answer is this: As much as you want it to. Good helmets start around $50 and go up to $300 or more. It depends on which bells and whistles you’re looking for.</p><p>There are great helmets with top safety rankings like the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/08/18/specialized-align-ii-bike-helmet-offers-mips-protection-modern-look-at-impressive-price/\">Specialized Align II that are only $50</a>, while other helmets can easily cost ten times more. Bigger helmets are also usually more expensive, so expect to spend more for a full face downhill helmet versus a commuter lid.</p><p>And, the lighter a helmet is, the pricier it will be. That’s because it takes a lot more engineering and expensive materials (like carbon fiber) to reduce weight without compromising safety.</p><p>And while we don’t recommend any big-box or off-brand helmets, it’s important to remind you that <em>any</em> helmet is better than no helmet. Anything sold in a legitimate retailer must pass the same safety standards. If your price range is sub-$25, you should still buy a helmet, even if it doesn’t have the latest and greatest technologies.</p><div id=\"attachment_258852\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14121642/best-womens-bicycle-helmet-with-a-visor.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-258852\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14121642/best-womens-bicycle-helmet-with-a-visor.jpg\" alt=\"the best womens overall cycling helmet for most types of riding is the bontrager velocis mips with integrated soft visor\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14121642/best-womens-bicycle-helmet-with-a-visor.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14121642/best-womens-bicycle-helmet-with-a-visor-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14121642/best-womens-bicycle-helmet-with-a-visor-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14121642/best-womens-bicycle-helmet-with-a-visor-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14121642/best-womens-bicycle-helmet-with-a-visor-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14121642/best-womens-bicycle-helmet-with-a-visor-696x522.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14121642/best-womens-bicycle-helmet-with-a-visor-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14121642/best-womens-bicycle-helmet-with-a-visor-560x420.jpg 560w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14121642/best-womens-bicycle-helmet-with-a-visor-80x60.jpg 80w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14121642/best-womens-bicycle-helmet-with-a-visor-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-258852\">Bontrager’s NeoVisor slots directly into the brow pad, making it the sleekest removable visor available for road and gravel riding…we even love it for everyday commuting!</p></div><h3>Why would I want a visor on my helmet?</h3><p>Many mountain bike helmets come with detachable visors.

Most importantly, it provides comfort and prevents rubbing between the helmet and your head.

When helmet shopping, look for padding with antimicrobial properties which reduce odor. Also, padding that can be removed and washed either by hand or in the gentle cycle is a valuable feature. Removable padding also lets you replace it when worn out.</p><div id=\"attachment_262687\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23140505/Dainese-Linea-01-worlds-lightest-full-face-helmet_lightweight-MIPS-DH-MTB-protection-at-570g_Mountain-Bike-Connection-rider-Kasia-Szlezak_photos-by-Rupert-Fowler_open-front.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-262687\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23140505/Dainese-Linea-01-worlds-lightest-full-face-helmet_lightweight-MIPS-DH-MTB-protection-at-570g_Mountain-Bike-Connection-rider-Kasia-Szlezak_photos-by-Rupert-Fowler_open-front.jpg\" alt=\"Dainese Linea 01 world's lightest full face helmet, lightweight MIPS DH MTB protection at 570g, Mountain Bike Connection rider Kasia Szlezak, photos by Rupert Fowler, front\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23140505/Dainese-Linea-01-worlds-lightest-full-face-helmet_lightweight-MIPS-DH-MTB-protection-at-570g_Mountain-Bike-Connection-rider-Kasia-Szlezak_photos-by-Rupert-Fowler_open-front.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23140505/Dainese-Linea-01-worlds-lightest-full-face-helmet_lightweight-MIPS-DH-MTB-protection-at-570g_Mountain-Bike-Connection-rider-Kasia-Szlezak_photos-by-Rupert-Fowler_open-front-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23140505/Dainese-Linea-01-worlds-lightest-full-face-helmet_lightweight-MIPS-DH-MTB-protection-at-570g_Mountain-Bike-Connection-rider-Kasia-Szlezak_photos-by-Rupert-Fowler_open-front-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23140505/Dainese-Linea-01-worlds-lightest-full-face-helmet_lightweight-MIPS-DH-MTB-protection-at-570g_Mountain-Bike-Connection-rider-Kasia-Szlezak_photos-by-Rupert-Fowler_open-front-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23140505/Dainese-Linea-01-worlds-lightest-full-face-helmet_lightweight-MIPS-DH-MTB-protection-at-570g_Mountain-Bike-Connection-rider-Kasia-Szlezak_photos-by-Rupert-Fowler_open-front-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23140505/Dainese-Linea-01-worlds-lightest-full-face-helmet_lightweight-MIPS-DH-MTB-protection-at-570g_Mountain-Bike-Connection-rider-Kasia-Szlezak_photos-by-Rupert-Fowler_open-front-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23140505/Dainese-Linea-01-worlds-lightest-full-face-helmet_lightweight-MIPS-DH-MTB-protection-at-570g_Mountain-Bike-Connection-rider-Kasia-Szlezak_photos-by-Rupert-Fowler_open-front-696x522.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23140505/Dainese-Linea-01-worlds-lightest-full-face-helmet_lightweight-MIPS-DH-MTB-protection-at-570g_Mountain-Bike-Connection-rider-Kasia-Szlezak_photos-by-Rupert-Fowler_open-front-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23140505/Dainese-Linea-01-worlds-lightest-full-face-helmet_lightweight-MIPS-DH-MTB-protection-at-570g_Mountain-Bike-Connection-rider-Kasia-Szlezak_photos-by-Rupert-Fowler_open-front-560x420.jpg 560w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23140505/Dainese-Linea-01-worlds-lightest-full-face-helmet_lightweight-MIPS-DH-MTB-protection-at-570g_Mountain-Bike-Connection-rider-Kasia-Szlezak_photos-by-Rupert-Fowler_open-front-80x60.jpg 80w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23140505/Dainese-Linea-01-worlds-lightest-full-face-helmet_lightweight-MIPS-DH-MTB-protection-at-570g_Mountain-Bike-Connection-rider-Kasia-Szlezak_photos-by-Rupert-Fowler_open-front-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-262687\">Photo: Rupert Fowler</p></div><h3>Why would I wear goggles instead of sunglasses?</h3><p>You’ll mostly find goggles on downhill or enduro mountain bikers, but goggles are great for harsh winter commutes and fat biking as well. Like ski goggles, they offer more protection than sunglasses. If you’re wearing a full-face helmet, they’ll fit -and look- a lot better than sunglasses, too.</p><p>Most full-face, convertible, or enduro-style mountain bike helmets are shaped to accommodate goggles. Many even have clips or channels on the rear to keep the strap from sliding out of place. Other types of helmets, like those for road, gravel, and XC MTB, are not shaped in a way that works with goggles. If you plan to wear goggles, bring them with you when shopping for a helmet to make sure they fit well with that specific helmet.</p><p>If you’re helmet shopping in a store and you love your current riding sunglasses, we also recommend bringing those with you. Different helmets have different fits that accommodate different styles of sunglasses better than others. They also may have channels that allow you to stick the sunglasses into the helmet when you don’t need them, but again, some glasses will fit certain channels better than others.</p><h3>Why is a name-brand helmet so much cheaper online than in my local bike shop?</h3><p>Buyer beware; counterfeit bike helmets are all over the internet. If the price is too good to be true, it’s probably a fake. And yes, this matters: A counterfeit helmet is not manufactured to the same safety specifications as a non-counterfeit helmet. Don’t take that chance. If you buy online, stick to a reputable dealer.</p><p>We also recommend shopping for a helmet at your local bike shop. It’s nice to have the ability to try it on, and they’ll help find the best model for your head shape.</p><p>But the answer to your question is this: Many brands sell unsold inventory to online stores in bulk, at a big discount, when they need to make room for new models. So, if you don’t mind last year’s colors or designs, and you already know how it will fit (or <em>that</em> it will fit correctly), then there are deals to be had.</p><div id=\"attachment_260178\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27083714/Met-road-helmet-rivale.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-260178\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27083714/Met-road-helmet-rivale.jpg\" alt=\"met rivale road helmet review rear view\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27083714/Met-road-helmet-rivale.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27083714/Met-road-helmet-rivale-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27083714/Met-road-helmet-rivale-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27083714/Met-road-helmet-rivale-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27083714/Met-road-helmet-rivale-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27083714/Met-road-helmet-rivale-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27083714/Met-road-helmet-rivale-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27083714/Met-road-helmet-rivale-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-260178\">Photo: Met Helmets</p></div><h3>Do I need a women’s specific helmet?</h3><p>There’s really no such thing as a “women’s specific” helmet, so don’t expect to find one in any bike shop. But for those with longer hair, a helmet with a wider opening in the back, between the bottom of the shell and the tension adjustment strap or dial is ideal. This feature allows you to pull your hair through that spot without interfering with the tension system. Check out our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/05/13/best-womens-bike-helmets/\">Women’s Helmet Buyer’s Guide</a> for more tips on finding a great helmet.</p><h3>When should I replace a bike helmet?</h3><p>After any crash where you sustained a hit to the helmet, you should absolutely replace it. Many companies will even offer crash replacement helmets for free or at a discount, especially within the first year after purchasing, so check with your helmet manufacturer post-crash.</p><p>Side note: If your helmet is damaged in a crash and you’re using any type of insurance or pursuing any legal action, save that damaged helmet. Cycling lawyer Ian Brisbin recommends hanging onto any torn kit or damaged goods post-crash, in case you need it later as evidence.</p><div id=\"attachment_102638\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Smith-Forefront-mountain-bike-helmet-review-1.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-102638\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Smith-Forefront-mountain-bike-helmet-review-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Smith-Forefront-mountain-bike-helmet-review-1.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Smith-Forefront-mountain-bike-helmet-review-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Smith-Forefront-mountain-bike-helmet-review-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Smith-Forefront-mountain-bike-helmet-review-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-102638\">Even small cracks are reason to replace your helmet after a wreck.</p></div><p>Check your helmet regularly for cracks or breaks, since occasionally, helmets can hit the ground and get cracked. Kids play in the garage? All it takes is one shove and your pricey helmet is cracked after hitting concrete during a game of tag.</p><p>The good news is that if you haven’t crashed, your helmet should last for quite a while.<a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/bike-helmets/when-you-really-need-to-replace-your-bike-helmet/\"> Consumer Reports notes</a> that unless there’s a compelling reason – like a crash or a broken strap – to replace your helmet, you can keep it as long as you want. Don’t try to dabble in helmet repair. If a strap breaks, contact the company rather than busting out super glue.</p><p>That said, technology is improving rapidly. If you’re still using your foam helmet from the early 90s, you may want to replace it simply because the tech has come such a long way in the last two decades. The foam on your 1992 neon pink helmet might still be intact (and the color is now retro-chic), but that helmet won’t have MIPS or a BOA-style fit system.</p><div id=\"attachment_253173\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17121232/troy-lee-a3-helmet-sweat-glide-management.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-253173\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17121232/troy-lee-a3-helmet-sweat-glide-management.jpg\" alt=\"troy lee designs a3 mtb helmet spa scenario sweat glide system\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17121232/troy-lee-a3-helmet-sweat-glide-management.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17121232/troy-lee-a3-helmet-sweat-glide-management-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17121232/troy-lee-a3-helmet-sweat-glide-management-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17121232/troy-lee-a3-helmet-sweat-glide-management-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17121232/troy-lee-a3-helmet-sweat-glide-management-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17121232/troy-lee-a3-helmet-sweat-glide-management-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17121232/troy-lee-a3-helmet-sweat-glide-management-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17121232/troy-lee-a3-helmet-sweat-glide-management-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-253173\">Take care of your helmet and take care of yourself. Photo: Troy Lee Designs</p></div><h3><b>How can I take care of my helmet?</b></h3><p>Store your helmet at home carefully: If it’s balanced on a top shelf in the garage and gets knocked over, that could be the end of your helmet’s lifespan. And store your helmet out of the sun and heat…Don’t leave them in your car or laying out in the backyard. The sun may bleach some of the color from your high-vis helmet over time…and degrade the EPS foam.</p><p>Clean your helmet regularly as well. This means wiping down the hard bits of your helmet, but it also means carefully cleaning your helmet pads and straps. We like padding that can be removed and hand-washed or tossed in the laundry, and you should be doing this regularly, especially if you’re prone to breakouts.</p><p>You should also give your helmet strap a good wash regularly, using dish soap to cut grease from oily skin, sunscreen, and the sports drink that dribbled down your chin on your last ride. Helmet straps can get extremely gross, and can lead to serious chin breakouts for acne-prone skin if not treated with care.</p><h3>How can I take care of my helmet while traveling?</h3><p>Helmets should stay with you on a plane, preferably in your carry-on. Remember that helmets aren’t made to withstand compression, especially side compression since your head is normally there to provide something to press against.</p><p>If your helmet is crammed in a soft bike bag, and then the bag is tossed in a pile in the belly of a plane, that helmet could be compressed for hours. This editor had her own compress-and-snap issue when traveling with a pricey helmet in her bike bag years ago. The same is true packing a trunk of a car: make sure your helmet isn’t squished!</p><p><b>Am I required by law to wear a helmet when biking?</b></p><p>While there is no federal law in the U.S. requiring an adult to wear a helmet, some state and local laws cover children, adults, and eBikes. They vary by region, so check<a href=\"https://www.helmets.org/mandator.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> the laws in your state</a> to see what’s required…or just wear one anyway because you only have one brain!</p><p><b>How do I know what helmet to choose?</b></p><p>We have a few ideas!
