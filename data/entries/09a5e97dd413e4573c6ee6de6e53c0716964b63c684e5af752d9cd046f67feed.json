Our list of the best mountain bike disc brakes has put popular hydraulic disc systems head-to-head.</p>\n<p>Having good brakes on your bike makes you go faster. Sound like an oxymoron? Maybe, but it’s true. The fact is, if you know you can quickly and efficiently bring your speed under control, you’re more likely to let it creep up into the red zone. Consequently, you become a faster and more controlled rider.</p>\n<p>For more bike control, you want not only power, but also effective modulation of that power, where subtle variations in lever force give a much more controllable braking force, rather than an on/off feel.</p>\n<p>That way, you’ll reduce unintentional skidding and the resultant reduction in braking power and bike control.</p>\n<p>Some brakes come with four pistons in the caliper and others with two pistons. Four pistons offer more braking power but can increase weight.</p>\n<p>A level of adjustability at the lever is helpful for effective control and to reduce hand fatigue. Riders with smaller hands will want a shorter lever reach, an adjustment most sets have as standard, but the ability to change the bite point of the brake can also help get it in the sweet spot where your fingers have the most leverage.</p>\n<p>Practically speaking, you want stoppers with low maintenance requirements, which hydraulic units generally bring (save for the occasional <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/give-any-hydraulic-brake-the-bleed-of-its-life/\">brake bleed</a>), and easy <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-change-the-disc-brake-pads-on-your-bike/\">swapping out of brake pads</a> when the time comes.</p>\n<p>When we take the best mountain bike disc brakes out for testing, we keep all this in mind: checking for power, feel, fade, modulation and reliability. There are plenty of fitting and dismantling sessions too, to figure out how easy the brakes are to maintain and service.</p>\n<p>You can find out more about what to look for when buying disc brakes at the end of this article, but otherwise keep reading to see our pick of the best mountain bike disc brakes, as reviewed and rated by the expert team here at BikeRadar.</p>\n<h2>The best mountain bike disc brakes, as rated by our expert testers</h2>\n<h3>Formula Cura 4</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Formula Cura 4 Hydraulic brake system for mountain bikes\" title=\"Best hydraulic disc brakes mtb 04\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s power in spades, but the smooth, progressive way it’s applied is even more impressive.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Mccandish / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pistons:</strong> Four</li>\n<li><strong>Fluid:</strong> Mineral oil</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 246g</li>\n<li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> Reach (TD)</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £150 / AU$295 as tested</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Without much experience of Formula brakes in recent years, we tried the Cura 4 with no expectations. Fitting and bleeding were slightly fiddly, with tight pad clearances making a rub-free result hard to achieve.

This helps give plenty of control and also enables Shimano to create more space between the pads and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/disc-brake-rotors/\">disc brake rotors</a> – ideal for mucky conditions.</p>\n<p>The pads are held in place with a split pin, which is easier to produce but potentially makes for fiddlier pad changes.</p>\n<p>The tubes come out of the brakes at a fixed angle and the tubing for the rear brake is 1,700mm, which might not be long enough for the most progressive downhill or enduro bikes.</p>\n<p>Despite a few minor quirks, it’s hard to fault these four-pot brakes from Shimano.

This might not seem ideal, but it does allow you to feather speed when you’re going fast.</p>\n<p>When it comes to maintenance, bleeding the brakes is easy and the long hoses should fit almost all bikes.

The two pistons on the rear caliper are oversized, so there’s still a good chunk of stopping power.</p>\n<p>The lever has a flip-flop design and reach adjustment, and Magura offers different lever blade types, which can alter the interface between finger and brake. The single-finger design we tested gave a reasonably sharp initial bite and in the mid-stroke it offered plenty of modulation.</p>\n<p>Magura has made the lever body from a material it calls ‘carbontecture’, which appears to be a carbon-infused composite. This helps the brakes achieve their low weight but at the bar, in general, the construction quality of these brakes doesn’t seem to match the price. However, this doesn’t stop these brakes from ultimately offering loads of manageable power.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/brakes/disc-brake-systems/magura-mt-trail-sl-disc-brakes-review/\">Read our full Magura MT Trail SL disc brakes review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Shimano SLX M7120</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano SLX M7120 disc brakes for mountain bikes\" title=\"Shimano SLX M7120 disc brakes\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano’s mid-priced SLX brakes offer almost as much performance as their pricier siblings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pistons:</strong> Four</li>\n<li><strong>Fluid:</strong> Mineral oil</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 307g (front), 320g (rear)</li>\n<li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> Reach (TF)</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £160 / $180 as tested</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sitting between the budget Shimano Deore and higher-end Shimano XT groupsets, Shimano SLX is sometimes overlooked.

Pair this with the lever feel and these brakes are super-positive, engaging power almost instantly, and giving that trademark Shimano brake feel.</p>\n<p>Arguably, this makes applying power with finesse harder than other brakes, but it does give you plenty of confidence that things are working as they should. However, getting the right bleed is critical to the performance of these brakes.</p>\n<p>The SLX M7120 might not have the same functions as Shimano’s pricier brakes, notably Free Stroke adjustment, but we didn’t miss this a great deal in testing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/brakes/disc-brake-systems/shimano-slx-m7120-disc-brakes-review/\">Read our full Shimano SLX M7120 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Shimano XT M8120</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano XT M8120 mountain bike disc brakes - best for DH / Enduro\" title=\"Shimano XT M8120 - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano’s XT M8120 stoppers pack a punch with one of the best lever feels in the business.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pistons:</strong> Four</li>\n<li><strong>Fluid:</strong> Mineral Oil</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 314g (rear no rotor)</li>\n<li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> Reach, bite point</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £200 / €249.49 / $210 / AU$326.99 as tested</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The XT M8120s are Shimano’s high-end trail brakes and feature all of the best tech found on the flagship XTR model, only using slightly heavier materials.</p>\n<p>The initial bite is punchy with a lot of power delivered early, making it easily accessible without having to pull the lever a long way through its rotor-contact stroke.</p>\n<p>Hoses arrive unattached, making them easy to route into frames, and only on occasion did we need to re-bleed the brake after cutting the hose.</p>\n<p>While we did experience some noise from the rear brake when the heavier-vented pads would occasionally vibrate against the disc, the XT remains a benchmark brake.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/brakes/disc-brake-systems/shimano-xt-m8120-brakes-review/\">Read our full Shimano XT M8120 brakes review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Shimano XTR M9100</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano XTR M9100 mountain bike disc brakes - best for XC / Downcountry\" title=\"Shimano XTR M9100 - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano’s race-ready XC brake packs two pistons into a lightweight package.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pistons:</strong> Two</li>\n<li><strong>Fluid:</strong> Mineral oil</li>\n<li><strong>Weight: </strong>202g (rear no rotor)</li>\n<li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> Reach</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £235 / €254.95 / $262 as tested</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A race-ready XC brake with weight saving as its principle.

You don’t have to do this often, but it’s handy and far easier when you do.</p>\n<h3>Brake fluid</h3>\n<p>Hydraulic brakes use mineral oil or DOT fluid to drive their pistons.
