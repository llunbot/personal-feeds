With the 2021 redesign, Apple has reintroduced ports to the MacBook Pro, such as HDMI and an SD card slot, and brought back <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a>. The new MacBook Pros are also powered by the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Pro or ‌M1‌ Max chips, the first Apple silicon chips designed for professional machines. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the new MacBook Pros are now starting to ship to customers ahead of a Tuesday launch, those who have yet to place their orders or perhaps did so a little after pre-orders went live should prepare to face a long wait. For current Mac users not getting a new Mac this week, there is still something to look forward to as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> launches on Monday, October 25. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>From Australia, mine has just shipped! <a href=\"https://t.co/NksfMWp3op\">pic.twitter.com/NksfMWp3op</a></p>— Opaque Sphere (@OpaqueSphere) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpaqueSphere/status/1451880308761001986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 23, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nApple opened pre-orders for the completely redesigned MacBook Pros following its \"Unleashed\" event last week. Within minutes of pre-orders going live, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/macbook-pro-delivery-dates-slipping/\">delivery dates were already slipping by weeks and in some cases by over a month.</a>. The 14-inch model, at the time of writing, displays at least 3-4 weeks for delivery, with all 16-inch models showing 4-5 weeks. Exact delivery date estimates will vary depending on location, configuration, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWeeks ahead of the holiday season, a primetime for Apple, a number of the company's products <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/21/device-shortage-threatens-apple-holiday-quarter/\">continue to face long delivery dates</a>. Models of the latest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a>, and even the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a> are showing weeks for delivery, potentially impacting customers' holiday shopping plans.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14 &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/23/new-macbook-pros-now-shipping/\">New MacBook Pros Now Starting to Ship to Customers Ahead of Tuesday Release</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-macbook-pros-now-starting-to-ship-to-customers-ahead-of-tuesday-release.2318885/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=z3CiMsNQJ4k:FxiplApz1hk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=z3CiMsNQJ4k:FxiplApz1hk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/z3CiMsNQJ4k\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b9c266d693eba2adb2f09bece9dc835d7803ec62fd1cdcdf076471be4ce40c48","category":"Apple"}
