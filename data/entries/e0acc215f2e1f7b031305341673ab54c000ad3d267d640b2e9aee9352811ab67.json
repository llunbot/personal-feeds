Apple has yet to confirm the fourth season, and there is no set release date yet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe third season of <em>Ted Lasso</em> ran from March through May of 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTed Lasso, played by Jason Sudeikis, is a small-time football coach from Kansas who is hired to coach a professional soccer team in England, despite having no experience coaching soccer. The series has won several major awards since it debuted in 2020, with its overall positive tone proving especially comforting during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven how immensely popular <em>Ted Lasso</em> is, its long-rumored fourth season apparently being confirmed is a huge win for Apple TV+.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Exclusive: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TedLasso?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TedLasso</a> S4 is set to begin pre-production in January.
