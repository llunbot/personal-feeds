Punt had it all—fragrant myrrh and frankincense, precious electrum (a mixed alloy of gold and silver) and malachite, and coveted leopard skins, among other exotic luxury goods.</p>\n<p>Despite being a trading partner for over a millennium, the ancient Egyptians never disclosed Punt’s exact whereabouts except for vague descriptions of voyages along what’s now the Red Sea. That could mean anywhere from southern Sudan to Somalia and even Yemen.</p>\n<p>Now, according to a <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/87513\">recent paper</a> published in the journal eLife, Punt may have been the same as another legendary port city in modern-day Eritrea, known as Adulis by the Romans. The conclusion comes from a genetic analysis of a baboon that was mummified during ancient Egypt’s Late Period (around 800 and 500 BCE). The genetics indicate the animal originated close to where Adulis would be known to come into existence centuries later.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982985#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982985&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e76afbcb34222d61b1fd3ccc566a2d4d13f21d06a2490a1476d6463f650890e8","category":"Tech"}
