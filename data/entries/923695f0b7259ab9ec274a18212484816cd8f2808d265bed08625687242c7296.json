During the flight, the first stage of the rocket performed well during ascent and, after separating from the upper stage, made a controlled reentry into the Gulf of Mexico. The Starship upper stage appeared to make a nominal flight through space before making a controlled—if fiery—landing in the Indian Ocean.</p>\n<p>The new video focuses mostly on the \"Super Heavy\" booster stage and its entry into the Gulf. There is new footage from a camera on top of the 71-meter-tall first stage as well as a nearby buoy at water level. The video from the buoy, in particular, shows the first stage making an upright landing into the ocean.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035253#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035253&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"923695f0b7259ab9ec274a18212484816cd8f2808d265bed08625687242c7296","category":"Tech"}
