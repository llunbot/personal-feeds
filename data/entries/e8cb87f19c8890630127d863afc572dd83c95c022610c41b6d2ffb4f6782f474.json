Small protuberances on the frame, located on the sides of the headtube, downtube, and seatstay-seat tube junction, keep air flowing more smoothly over the surface to reduce drag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s called Vortex-Tubing Technology, and they say it cuts a cylinder’s drag in half, and the protrusions allow for thinner (lighter) wall thicknesses than dimples would, so it’s a win-win.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/trigon-ar01-aero-road-bike-with-dimples-05.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/trigon-ar01-aero-road-bike-with-dimples-05-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Trigon AR01 aero road bike with speed dimples\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/trigon-ar01-aero-road-bike-with-dimples-05-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/trigon-ar01-aero-road-bike-with-dimples-05-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/trigon-ar01-aero-road-bike-with-dimples-05-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/trigon-ar01-aero-road-bike-with-dimples-05-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/trigon-ar01-aero-road-bike-with-dimples-05-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/trigon-ar01-aero-road-bike-with-dimples-05.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve seen strips and grooves from Ridley before, and Zipp’s known for their dimples, but Trigon’s design has the bumps, um, bumping outward, and has them spread across more of the frame.

It has two PowerTube batteries for a total 1500W of power. Combined with front and rear racks and a compact build, it looks like a sweet way to get around town, or up the mountain for a picnic, or exploring a new city all day…which was the point of the design. It’s inspired by the Tour de France, and with a 200km+ range, you could take it up the mountain for a day, watch a stage, and then roll around town celebrating all evening.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-01-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"KMC racing Duo chain and chainring for improved power transfer\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-01.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-02.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-02-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"KMC racing Duo chain and chainring for improved power transfer\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-02-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KMC-Racing-Duo-chain-and-chainring-02.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming <a href=\"https://www.kmcchain.com\" target=\"_blank\">KMC</a> Racing Duo is a chain plus chainring combo with teeth specifically shaped for the chain’s rollers.

It clicks across individual pins that line the entire perimeter, with stepped engagement to offer quick engagement since only every third pin is engaged at any time. The design’s main benefit is that it can use larger diameter bearings and place them further outboard, making for a stiffer hub.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-02.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-02-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"AirShif automatically shifting rear derailleur\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-02-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-02.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-04.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-04-800x675.jpg\" alt=\"AirShif automatically shifting rear derailleur\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-04-800x675.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-04-297x251.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-04-120x101.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-04-768x648.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/AirShif-auto-shifting-rear-derailleur-with-app-04.jpg 1185w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirShif auto-shifting derailleur is interesting in that it takes a concept more typically used with internally geared hubs and applies it to an external derailleur. Using the app, you input your gear combos and set preferences for cadence, with the ability to have several modes. Pick the mode you want and the system will shift for you to maintain a desired pedaling cadence range.

They say that in many cases, when a multi-cell e-bike battery fails, it’s often just one or two cells inside that have gone bad. And pretty much every e-bike battery is a multi-cell design (listen to our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/podcast-078-bosch-explains-whats-going-on-with-e-bike-battery/\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Bosch</a> about e-bike battery safety to learn why), with 20+ individual cells in each battery pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gouach-e-bike-battery-with-replaceable-cells-03.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gouach-e-bike-battery-with-replaceable-cells-03-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"gouach e-bike battery with user replaceable cells\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gouach-e-bike-battery-with-replaceable-cells-03-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gouach-e-bike-battery-with-replaceable-cells-03-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gouach-e-bike-battery-with-replaceable-cells-03-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gouach-e-bike-battery-with-replaceable-cells-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gouach-e-bike-battery-with-replaceable-cells-03-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gouach-e-bike-battery-with-replaceable-cells-03.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if one cell goes bad and then you need to replace your entire battery pack, clearly there’s a lot of waste happening. Gouach solves for this by making e-mobility batteries with user-replaceable cells.

If you have an e-bike, chances are high that the bolt-on kickstand comes loose or has sheared the bolts and broken off entirely. This has happened to me on multiple bikes because the extra weight is simply too much for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This system attaches the kickstand directly to the thru axle, using a specific interface on the dropout. So, no, you can’t add this to your existing bike, but here’s hoping bike brands adopt the interface (shown in detail <a href=\"https://www.cl-massload.com.tw/products_detail/220\" target=\"_blank\">on their website</a>) and start using the already robust thru-axle as the attachment point.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/digirit-magnetic-bicycle-pedal-for-easy-parking-against-metal-rails-02.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/digirit-magnetic-bicycle-pedal-for-easy-parking-against-metal-rails-02-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"magnetic bicycle pedals that hold the bike against metal racks and rails\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/digirit-magnetic-bicycle-pedal-for-easy-parking-against-metal-rails-02-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/digirit-magnetic-bicycle-pedal-for-easy-parking-against-metal-rails-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/digirit-magnetic-bicycle-pedal-for-easy-parking-against-metal-rails-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/digirit-magnetic-bicycle-pedal-for-easy-parking-against-metal-rails-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/digirit-magnetic-bicycle-pedal-for-easy-parking-against-metal-rails-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/digirit-magnetic-bicycle-pedal-for-easy-parking-against-metal-rails-02.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.digirit.com/pedal-park\" target=\"_blank\">Digirit Pedal Park</a> has a strong magnet in it so you can stick your bike to any metal rack, rail, pole, fence post, wall, sign, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wellgo-quick-release-bicycle-pedal-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wellgo-quick-release-bicycle-pedal-01-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"wellgo quick release pedals for commuter and folding bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wellgo-quick-release-bicycle-pedal-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wellgo-quick-release-bicycle-pedal-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wellgo-quick-release-bicycle-pedal-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wellgo-quick-release-bicycle-pedal-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wellgo-quick-release-bicycle-pedal-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wellgo-quick-release-bicycle-pedal-01.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wellgopedal.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wellgo</a> is working on a Quick Release Device that lets you quickly take any pedal on or off the bike without tools.

First, it has an adjustable length, helping it fit more bikes with fewer SKUs. On the other end is a twist-to-lock nut. Rather than thread the axle in like normal, you slide it in, then twist the nut on the opposite side to capture the axle. Then close the lever to pull it tight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design not only prevents the axle from coming out if the lever comes open, but since would-be thieves won’t know how it works, it provides some security for your wheels, too…but takes just seconds to open and remove if you know what you’re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hidden-cable-lock-inside-bicycle-handlebars-.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hidden-cable-lock-inside-bicycle-handlebars--800x600.jpg\" alt=\"cable lock that hides inside a handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hidden-cable-lock-inside-bicycle-handlebars--800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hidden-cable-lock-inside-bicycle-handlebars--297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hidden-cable-lock-inside-bicycle-handlebars--120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hidden-cable-lock-inside-bicycle-handlebars--768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hidden-cable-lock-inside-bicycle-handlebars--1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hidden-cable-lock-inside-bicycle-handlebars-.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This light-duty cable lock hides in your handlebar, just twist the lock out of the bar plug and pull it out.
