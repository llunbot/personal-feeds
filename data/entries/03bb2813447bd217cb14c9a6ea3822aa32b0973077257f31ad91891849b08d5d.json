{"title":"Two Additional Observations Regarding Apple’s Core Technology Fee","link":"https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/","date":1706570063000,"content":"\n<p>From Apple’s support page for the new Core Technology Fee announced last week:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nonprofit organizations, accredited educational institutions, and \ngovernment entities who are approved for a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/membership-fee-waiver/\">fee waiver</a> are exempt \nfrom the Core Technology Fee, subject to the Apple Developer \nProgram’s existing rules. Developers of alternative app \nmarketplaces will pay the Core Technology Fee for every first \nannual install of their app marketplace, including installs that \noccur before one million. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One problem I see with the Core Technology Fee is that it doesn’t seem compatible with the concept of completely free-of-charge apps from developers who aren’t registered non-profits, educational institutions, or governments. What we used to call freeware back in the day. Like what about <a href=\"https://netnewswire.com/\">NetNewsWire</a>? That’s a totally free and open source app, but it’s not from a non-profit, school, or government. I feel like developers of freeware should be able to apply for an exemption. Perhaps even only for open source freeware?</p>\n\n<p>The second sentence quoted above is something I didn’t notice until <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2024/01/28/reviewing-news-coverage.html\">my friend Manton Reece pointed it out over the weekend</a>. Marketplace store apps don’t get 1 million free installs — they start paying the CTF after the first download.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/29/two-additional-observations-regarding-apples-core-technology-fee\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"03bb2813447bd217cb14c9a6ea3822aa32b0973077257f31ad91891849b08d5d","category":"Tech"}
