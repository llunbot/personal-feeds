BMW's third-generation electric car taught the automaker plenty about EV powertrains as well as more sustainable manufacturing. But the i3 has taught BMW all it could, and now the time has come to apply those lessons to more mainstream EVs.

Car makers develop new technology and launch it in their high-end vehicles first before economies of scale see such features show up in cheaper models. This is particularly true of the German luxury brands like BMW, which in the past used its 7 Series flagship sedan as its standard-bearer, introducing things like the first true infotainment system. But big sedan have fallen out of favor with the people who buy big luxury cars, and so the time has come for the flagship SUV instead.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798773#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798773&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
