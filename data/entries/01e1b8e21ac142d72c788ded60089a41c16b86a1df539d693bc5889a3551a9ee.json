They wrote about their experiment in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442\">preprint academic paper</a> released on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>\"Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day,\" write the researchers in their <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf\">paper</a>,  \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior.\"</p>\n<p>To pull this off, the researchers relied heavily on a large language model (LLM) for social interaction, specifically the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/chatgpt-and-whisper-apis-debut-allowing-devs-to-integrate-them-into-apps/\">ChatGPT API</a>. In addition, they created an architecture that simulates minds with memories and experiences, then let the agents loose in the world to interact. And humans can interact with them, too.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930578#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930578&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"01e1b8e21ac142d72c788ded60089a41c16b86a1df539d693bc5889a3551a9ee","category":"Tech"}
