And the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen-review-a-world-worth-saving/\">modern X-COM games</a> force me to realize just how much a 98% chance to hit is not the same as 100%.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379910/Dystopika/\"><em>Dystopika</em></a> (Steam, Windows) is a city builder in maybe the strictest definition of that two-word descriptor, because it steadfastly refuses to distract you with non-building details. The game is described by its single developer, Matt Marshall, as having \"No goals, no management, just creativity and dark cozy vibes.\"<em> Dystopika</em> does very little to explain how you should play it, because there's no optimal path for doing so. Your only job is to enjoy yourself, poking and prodding at a dark cyberpunk cityscape, making things that look interesting, pretty, grim, or however you like. It might seem restrictive, but it feels very freeing.</p>\n<div><div></div><div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      <em>Dystopika</em> launch video.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The game's interface is a small rail on the left side of the screen. Select \"Building\" and a random shape attaches to your cursor. You can right-click to change it, but you can't pick one. Place it, and then optionally place the cursor near its top to change its height. Making one building taller will raise smaller buildings nearby. Reaching certain heights, or densities, or something (it's not explained) will \"unlock\" certain new buildings, landmarks, and decorations.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/dystopika-takes-all-the-management-out-of-a-cyberpunk-city-simulator/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/dystopika-takes-all-the-management-out-of-a-cyberpunk-city-simulator/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a7b225112ce4ba866b3edde9dd5da1988316f75f73a31ac49088db0be53f4355","category":"Tech"}
