What are your expectations?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To win. I’d like to do the road race as well, but it depends because there are only four spots on the GB team. I also want to do the Madison on the track. So I’d like to win the Madison and the time-trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’ve now beaten almost all the top time-triallists on the WorldTour. Who’s your biggest remaining rival?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Filippo Ganna, my Ineos Grenadiers teammate. He’s the only one. We could be going head-to-head at the Paris Olympics. It would be nice to race against a friend; it’s exciting and I want to see what I can do.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/olympics-2024-preview\">Paris 2024 Olympics Cycling: Events, schedule, TV guide and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mauro-gianetti-interview\">‘We expect a completely new level from Tadej Pogačar’: Mauro Gianetti Q&amp;A</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vittoria-bussi-uci-hour-record\">Pro Log: Vittoria Bussi reclaims UCI Hour record, Josh Tarling beats Remco Evenepoel at Chrono des Nations, Madis Mihkels and Gerben Thijssen pulled from Tour of Guangxi for racist gesture</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p><strong>You’re from Aberaeron in West Wales, which is not really known as a breeding ground for WorldTour talent. How did you first get into road racing?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There weren’t a lot of cycling clubs around so my parents started a club, the West Wales Cycle Racing Team. We got loads of people involved and it really took off from there. We had people my age and it was really good – it was one of those environments where everyone was pushing each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most young British riders look to head to Europe for training camps but was West Wales a good location for training and developing your skills?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The roads are really good, really hard. In summer it was a bit busier with tourists, but other than that they’re quiet. There are no cities there, really, so you can be riding for a while and not see anyone. I really enjoyed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Were there preferred routes that you’d test yourself on?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d go towards Tregaron and do the Devil’s Staircase [a 1.5km climb with gradients touching 20%]. But in general the whole area is lumpy. Sometimes there are so many hills on a ride that I don’t know all their names. You’re just up and down, keeping the power on.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/josh-tarling-qa-2-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Tarling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/josh-tarling-qa-2-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/josh-tarling-qa-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/josh-tarling-qa-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/josh-tarling-qa-2-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/josh-tarling-qa-2-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/josh-tarling-qa-2-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/josh-tarling-qa-2-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/josh-tarling-qa-2.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Tornanti.cc</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Recently your development has been fast-tracked and you’ve set up home in Andorra. Has that been a big change?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a big change from junior racing to the WorldTour. I can do the on-bike stuff – the racing – but the biggest change has been the off-the-bike stuff, with staying in your own house and having adult responsibilities. If you’re a junior and you’re tired, it’s not like there’s no food in the house. Your parents will get food.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So you’ve had to learn to look after yourself more?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now if I’m tired and there’s no food, I have to go and get some. Plus I have to clean up afterwards. I enjoy cooking though. I like a curry – I can do that. But I’m a big lunch guy. I like a bagel with some fancy shit on it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In Geraint Thomas and Luke Rowe there’s already a strong Welsh contingent in the Grenadiers ranks, but is there any West Wales-South Wales rivalry?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year I did some races with Luke, but this year I haven’t seen either of them yet. It’s nice having Welsh people in the team. There’s no rivalry, but I’m one up on them because I can actually speak Welsh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ineos Grenadiers have a blend of old hands and young talent. Who has been your biggest mentor in the team?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not really one person. I like rooming with Swifty [Ben Swift]; he keeps me tidy. He does a lot of the off-bike stuff really well, as well as the on-bike stuff. Also Luke, obviously, for racing craft. And you look up to guys like Ganna, who’s won everything under the sun. But it doesn’t come from just one person.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>This season has been characterised by some nasty crashes and a growing debate about racing safety, particularly after the crash in the Tour of the Basque Country that took out Jonas Vingegaard, Primož Roglič and Remco Evenepoel. Does safety worry you?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a horrible crash and a horrible situation. I don’t know if it was a really dangerous descent. We’re all going to make mistakes, you know. I guess the safest environment is a velodrome because it’s controlled, but even there you get some of the biggest crashes. And crashes are going to happen. In that crash [the Tour of the Basque Country] I don’t think they were taking any more risks than usual. It didn’t look like there was any drag racing going on, so probably it was just a mistake. People crash, don’t they?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Obviously the Olympic Games is your big goal but how does the rest of the season pan out beyond that?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything leads towards the Olympics. Before then I’m going to train at altitude in Andorra, then ideally another altitude camp. But it might change. Otherwise, it’s the Tour of Norway, back on the track at the National Championships for leg speed and technique, some club 10s in the UK before the Nationals in June. But there’s no Tour de France for me this year. The Olympics is such a big goal and I would be knackered if I did the Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is there much chance of you making a Grand Tour debut this year?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to do the Vuelta [a España]. This year, with the Olympics, I think realistically that would be the best opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>• This article originally appeared in issue 154 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/olympics-2024-preview\">Paris 2024 Olympics Cycling: Events, schedule, TV guide and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mauro-gianetti-interview\">‘We expect a completely new level from Tadej Pogačar’: Mauro Gianetti Q&amp;A</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vittoria-bussi-uci-hour-record\">Pro Log: Vittoria Bussi reclaims UCI Hour record, Josh Tarling beats Remco Evenepoel at Chrono des Nations, Madis Mihkels and Gerben Thijssen pulled from Tour of Guangxi for racist gesture</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/josh-tarling-interview\">‘Everything leads towards the Olympics’: Josh Tarling Q&amp;A</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"93d0adc96133525c7150a0981eee156e309285667e8cceb3cfded1a68d8c24d4","category":"Cycling"}
