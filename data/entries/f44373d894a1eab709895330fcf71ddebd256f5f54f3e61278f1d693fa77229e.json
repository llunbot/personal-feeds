An app can support AirPlay 2 by implementing AVFoundation framework APIs, with a four-step process <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/media_playback_and_selection/getting_airplay_2_into_your_app\">outlined on Apple's developer website</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSpotify has also yet to add native support for the HomePod (or its HomePod mini successor), despite Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/22/homepod-third-party-music-services/\">opening up the speaker to third-party music services</a> last year. This is despite Spotify <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-complaint-vs-apple-in-europe/\">filing a complaint against Apple</a> with the European Commission in March 2019 that accused the iPhone maker of \"locking Spotify and other competitors out of Apple services such as Siri, HomePod, and Apple Watch.\" \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe've reached out to Spotify for comment and we'll provide an update if we hear back.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Update (Aug 7, 2021):</b> Spotify has reached out and indicates that the original post was not accurate and AirPlay 2 support is still in the works:\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>A post on one of Spotify’s Community pages contained incomplete information regarding our plans for AirPlay2.  Spotify will support AirPlay2 and we’re working to make that a reality.</blockquote>Spotify has <a href=\"https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/iOS-Airplay-2-Support-for-iOS/idi-p/4659638/page/7\">updated the original post</a> with the revised information. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay-2/\">AirPlay 2</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/spotify-pauses-airplay-2-support-for-ios-app/\">Spotify Pauses Plans to Add AirPlay 2 Support to iOS App [Update: Spotify Clarifies]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-pauses-plans-to-add-airplay-2-support-to-ios-app-update-spotify-clarifies.2306742/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kyqZItD0dh4:KK_zk8LQE3A:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kyqZItD0dh4:KK_zk8LQE3A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/kyqZItD0dh4\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f44373d894a1eab709895330fcf71ddebd256f5f54f3e61278f1d693fa77229e","category":"Apple"}
