The team have done an epic job producing something truly game-changing and totally plastic-free.'</p>\n<h3>Never mind the bottles</h3>\n<p>All elements have been refined to provide the most sustainable product possible. It comes in the form of two 30g powder sachets that each make 1 litre of cleaner with the addition of water – any clean water is fine, so it's perfect for bikepacking adventures.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9945/muc-off-punk-powder-images#1\"><p><span>Image 2 of</span> 11</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/mr5_8216.jpg?itok=c23wfJe9\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 2 of </span>11</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>Punk Powder's 'state-of-the-art formula' is made from biodegradable ingredients, three quarters of which are plant-based. On that note, it's also vegan-friendly, with no animal testing involved and vegetable-based inks used on the box.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://muc-off.com/collections/punk-powder?page=1\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy Muc-Off Punk Powder or Bottle For Life bundle now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>By selling it as a powder, Muc-Off says it uses 92% less packaging than for the same amount of regular cleaner and being much smaller and lighter it also helps to massively reduce the shipping impact, with the brand claiming Punk Powder will save over 61 tonnes of plastic globally each year.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2104/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a Espana 2021: Route, start list, live TV guide and all we know so far</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/8891/vuelta-a-espana-classic-climb-alto-de-velefique\">Vuelta a Espana Classic Climb: Alto de Velefique</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nWhat's more, the packaging it does use is 100% plastic and petroleum-free and made from over 50% renewable raw materials. The sachets are also compostable and the box is made from recycled card that can be converted into a funnel, extending its own life and helping prevent any wasted powder.</p>\n<p>While the powder means that you can reuse your old cleaner bottle – another obvious environmental benefit – Muc-Off has also used the opportunity to release a new product: the Bottle For Life, a long-lasting aluminium bottle with a non-toxic, food-grade silicone base that you can buy with the powder.</p>\n<p>The two-sachet pack of Punk Powder costs £14.99 while the Bottle For Life bundle will set you back £29.99.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://muc-off.com/collections/punk-powder?page=1\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy Muc-Off Punk Powder or Bottle For Life bundle now</strong></em></a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9945/muc-off-punk-powder-images\">Muc-Off Punk Powder images</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>2 Aug 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9945%2Fmuc-off-punk-powder-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Muc-Off%20Punk%20Powder%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9945%2Fmuc-off-punk-powder-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Muc-Off%20Punk%20Powder%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9945%2Fmuc-off-punk-powder-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Muc-Off%20Punk%20Powder%20images&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9945%2Fmuc-off-punk-powder-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9945/muc-off-punk-powder-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 11</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/mr5_8332.jpg?itok=uyWls2ab\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bicycle-maintenance\">Bicycle maintenance</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d362dbdd8c33d8b9e001725bf4706caa3def5464518ddc51951777ad3d625e77","category":"Cycling"}
