Cook referred to \"the newest member of the family,\" suggesting a launch event focused on a single product rather than multiple refreshes throughout its product lineup.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/report-iphone-se-could-shed-its-10-year-old-design-as-early-as-next-week/\">Most rumors</a> point to the \"family\" being the iPhone and the \"newest member\" being an updated version of the entry-level iPhone SE. Last refreshed in March of 2022 with the guts of late 2021's iPhone 13, the SE is the only iPhone in Apple's lineup that still ships with large display bezels and a Home button. And it's one of just three models (along with the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus) to still include a Lightning port.</p>\n<p>Previous reporting has suggested that the next-generation iPhone SE could replace both the current SE and the iPhone 14 series in the iPhone lineup, since the new phone is expected to ship with an iPhone 14-style design with an edge-to-edge display and a notch cutout. The old SE and the 14 series have already been discontinued in the EU, where new phones are all required to use a USB-C port.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/02/apple-teases-launch-for-the-newest-member-of-the-family-on-february-19/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/02/apple-teases-launch-for-the-newest-member-of-the-family-on-february-19/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3e76b97793d8f4d03bb4e97eecc1dda8d35e3660e887bdd55c9fba1b46bd81d7","category":"Tech"}
