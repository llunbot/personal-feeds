Last year, display industry analyst Ross Young said the iPhone 17 Air would have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/\">6.55-inch display</a>, or a 6.6-inch display when rounded up. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nNotably, this display size was challenged last month by YouTube creator Jon Prosser, who claimed that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/iphone-17-air-now-rumored-to-feature-6-7-inch-display/\">larger 6.7-inch display</a>. (Young has since <a href=\"https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1892716912091472071\">reiterated</a> his 6.55-inch display size claim for the iPhone 17 Air.)\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, if Prosser is correct and the iPhone 17 Air has a 6.7-inch display, that's still far off the expected 6.9-inch display size of the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Apple increased the display size of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max last year, and they are expected to remain the same for the iPhone 17 Pro models. Indeed, Ice Universe today said that the frame of iPhone 17 Pro Max has not changed, and is \"just like iPhone 16 Pro Max.\"\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th></th>\r<br />\n <th>iPhone 17 Pro Max</th>\r<br />\n <th>iPhone 17 Air</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Depth</th>\r<br />\n <td><strong>8.73 mm</strong></td>\r<br />\n <td><strong>5.55 mm</strong></td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Height</th>\r<br />\n <td>163 mm</td>\r<br />\n <td>163 mm</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Width</th>\r<br />\n <td>77.6 mm</td>\r<br />\n <td>77.6 mm</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Display</th>\r<br />\n <td>6.9\" (174 mm)</td>\r<br />\n <td>6.9\" (174 mm)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n<th>Screen Border</th>\r<br />\n<td>1.15 mm</td>\r<br />\n<td>1.15 mm</td>\r<br />\n </table>\r<br />\n<div></div><p></p>\r<br />\nIce Universe has previously revealed accurate dimensions of iPhones before they are released, including the sizes of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/iphone-16-pro-max-design-dimensions/\">iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>.
