{"title":"F1 in Monaco: No one has ever gone faster than that","link":"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/f1-in-monaco-no-one-has-ever-gone-faster-than-that/","date":1748354852000,"content":"<p>The principality of Monaco is perhaps the least suitable place on the Formula 1 calendar to hold a Grand Prix. A pirate cove turned tax haven nestled between France and Italy at the foot of the Alps-Maritimes, it has also been home to Grand Prix racing since 1929, predating the actual Formula 1 world championship by two decades. The track is short, tight, and perhaps best described as riding a bicycle around your living room. It doesn’t even race well, for the barrier-lined streets are too narrow for the too-big, too-heavy cars of the 21st century. And yet, it’s F1’s crown jewel.</p>\n<p>Despite the location's many drawbacks, there’s something magical about racing in Monaco that almost defies explanation. The real magic happens on Saturday, when the drivers compete against each other to set the fastest lap. With overtaking as difficult as it is here, qualifying is everything, determining the order everyone lines up in, and more than likely, finishes.</p>\n<p>Coverage of the Monaco Grand Prix is now filmed in vivid 4K, and it has never looked better. I’m a big fan of the static top-down camera that’s like a real-time Apple TV screensaver.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/f1-in-monaco-no-one-has-ever-gone-faster-than-that/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/f1-in-monaco-no-one-has-ever-gone-faster-than-that/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
