Historically, the carmaker has been an early adopter and developer of systems such as antilock brakes, stability control, airbags, and adaptive cruise control. With its EQ line of all-electric vehicles well underway, Mercedes-Benz is now making a push toward automated driving.</p>\n<p>We sampled the new Drive Pilot system, which will be available on the 2024 Mercedes-Benz S-Class and EQS sedans, on some of the most congested highways in Los Angeles. It’s the first level 3 automated driving system approved for use in the US, but initially it will only be available and active in California and Nevada. Drive Pilot allows for hands-free highway driving similar to other systems, such as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/02/the-cadillac-ct6-review-super-cruise-is-a-game-changer/\">Super Cruise from GM</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/fords-evs-bluecruise-combine-for-better-road-trips/\">BlueCruise from Ford</a>, or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/testing-bmws-biggest-and-best-sedan-now-fully-electric-the-2023-i7/\">Highway Assistant from BMW</a>, but goes further by allowing the driver to also take their eyes off the road.</p>\n<h2>A defined operation design domain</h2>\n<p>Certain conditions must be satisfied before you can activate Drive Pilot, an important concept in autonomous driving known as the “operational design domain.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971280#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971280&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f07ce26ec78453db9111f9dfb2af59a7acee9f0edc621a77eef6f60858241531","category":"Tech"}
