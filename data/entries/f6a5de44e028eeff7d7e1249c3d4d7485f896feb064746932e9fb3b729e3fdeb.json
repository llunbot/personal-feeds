Apple Intelligence will be available to the public later in the fall with the release of macOS Sequoia 15.1. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis point release will add several of the Apple Intelligence features, such as Writing Tools, an updated Siri design, Safari and Mail summaries, Reduce Interruptions Focus mode, and more. Other features, including Image Playground, Genmoji, and the Siri personal context and onscreen awareness will be coming later and are not in the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta. You can learn more about what's available and when in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/#apple_intelligence\">macOS 15 roundup</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe good news is that Apple has already seeded the second developer beta of macOS 15.1, which means you can try some of the AI features out for yourself by signing up for macOS beta access. Signing up to get the macOS Sequoia beta is simple, and can be done by following the steps below.
