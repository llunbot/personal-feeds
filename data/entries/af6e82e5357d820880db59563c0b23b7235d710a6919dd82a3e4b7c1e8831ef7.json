If you have plans to, I dunno, maybe hang out at the bar (or <em>pub</em>, for the UKers) or something like that with a bunch of PC-loving friends, well, y’all will have something to talk about tonight. Microsoft fired a salvo at Apple in the form of a video short that claims that “top Copilot+ PCs” are faster than the beloved MacBook Air. You can waste 12 seconds of your life watching it below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>(I’ll give you a moment to wipe the spit take from your screen. Sorry about that, I should’ve warned you.) Cheesy production aside (“Was this comically low budget ad made with Windows Movie Maker 2 and a 5 MP camera from 2003?” commented <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ItsRichieT\">@ItsRichieT</a>), the major sticking point about this ad is that it makes comparisons to the <em>M3</em> MacBook Air–you know, the laptop that was released in 2024 and replaced earlier this year by the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2631068/15-inch-macbook-air-m4-review.html\">M4 MacBook Air</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the M3 Air isn’t in Apple’s active product lineup. Granted, you can buy the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\">M3 MacBook Air</a> from third-party retailers and at <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/2024-macbook-air\">Apple’s Certified Refurbished store</a>. But it doesn’t look good when a company compares “top” products to competitors that aren’t being made anymore and have been replaced by something better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing is, Microsoft also claims the “top Copilot+ PCs” are faster than the M4 MacBook Air–it’s right <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/windows/copilotplus-claims?tabs=amd\">on their website</a>. But the results are nothing like the “up to 58 percent” touted in the ad. Microsoft says it recorded a Cinebench 2024 Multi-Core score of 866 for the M4 Air, and that eight Copilot+ PCs “all scored higher.” So, let me take the opportunity to do what Microsoft didn’t want to show you: how much faster those eight Copilot+ PCs are than the M4 MacBook Air (the Cinebench 2024 Multi-Core score is in parentheses).</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>ASUS Vivobook S 14 with AMD Ryzen AI 9 365: <strong>5.3 percent</strong> (912)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dell XPS 13 9345 with Snapdragon X Elite: <strong>8.9 percent</strong> (943.3)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>HP OmniBook Ultra 14 with AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 375: <strong>11.4 percent</strong> (965)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x 14″ with Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite: <strong>18.9 percent</strong> (1029.6)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x 14″ with Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite <strong>19.4 percent</strong> (1033.6)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 with AMD Ryzen AI 9 365: <strong>17.9 percent</strong> (1021.3)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Microsoft Surface Laptop 15″ with Snapdragon X Elite: <strong>9.7 percent </strong>(950)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Microsoft Surface Laptop 13.8″ with Snapdragon X Elite: <strong>2.7 percent</strong> (889.6)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo devices are the fastest of the bunch (I don’t know why the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x 14″ is tested twice; drop me a line if you can fill me in), but those improvements aren’t big enough to make an impression. Imagine that video, but instead it says, “Top Copilot+ PCs are up to 19.4 percent faster than a MacBook Air with M4.” That will just get you stupid looks from the Microsoft marketing department. Heck, we here at Macworld see 15 to 25 percent improvement from one M-series chip to another, and our reaction to that is lukewarm. You can imagine what we think about a Copilot+ PCs offering a less than 20 percent boost over the M4 MacBook Air: Pfft. As for all the other PCs? You won’t notice the difference at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We ran the same Cinebench 2024 test and got a score of 797 for the M4 MacBook Air, so clearly, results may vary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To sum up, for your PC-lovin’ buddies who want to bring up this ad over a few pints:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your “top Copilot+ PCs” are “up to 58 percent” faster than a discontinued MacBook Air? Cool!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The “top Copilot+ PCs” faster than the M4 MacBook Air? That may be true, but no one can notice the difference in real-world usage. But hey, nice of you to catch up!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The 12-second ad? Just another example of a corporation trying to relate to the young folks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And if they still won’t listen, just remember that they have to use Windows.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"af6e82e5357d820880db59563c0b23b7235d710a6919dd82a3e4b7c1e8831ef7","category":"Apple"}
