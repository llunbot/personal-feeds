But, in our ever-connected lives, it can also be useful to keep in touch with those at home or maybe live a bit of the digital nomad life and work as you travel. All of this relies on being able to keep your iPhone or iPad connected to the web, which is something that’s very easy to do with the affordable and generous plans offered by a <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.getnomad.app/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=macworld&amp;xcust=1-1-2375161-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Nomad eSIM</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is an eSIM?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests, these are software versions of SIM cards that don’t require you to put those little bits of plastic into your devices. This means you can’t lose them, and thanks to the Nomad app you’ll be able to buy and set one up in a matter of minutes when you arrive at your destination either by tapping a button or scanning a QR code. The app also comes with data management and monitoring features that work across multiple SIMs, so you know exactly how much you’ve used. If you need to top up, that’s all done through the app too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>eSIMs are compatible with iPhones as far back as the XS, XS Max and XR, as well as plenty of the cellular equipped iPads.

For example, if you’re thinking of taking that grand tour around mainland Europe, then you can do so with <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.getnomad.app/en/europe-eSIM&amp;xcust=1-1-2375161-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">10GB of data for 30 days</a> and it only costs $18 (around £14). The same is true if you’re travelling across <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.getnomad.app/en/north-america-eSIM&amp;xcust=1-1-2375161-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">North America</a>, while those venturing further afield to Thailand can pick up an eSIM with <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.getnomad.app/en/thailand-eSIM&amp;xcust=1-1-2375161-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">50GB of data</a> for only $8 (roughly £6), which is crazy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nomad is able to offer these prices, which usually work out around 20-40% cheaper than their rivals, due to the partnerships it has built with providers all across the globe. This also means that the company tries to offer multiple network services in each country, so if one is struggling then you can switch to the faster connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are great deals for short trips too, with the various Day Plans offering a set amount of high-speed data across a specified number of days (1, 3, 5, 7 or 10), which then switches to free unlimited data at throttled speeds when you run out. The good news is that the 512kbps limit is still likely to be faster than many of Nomad’s competitors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best of all, there’s a very good chance that any plan will be cheaper and more generous than what you’d get when purchasing a roaming package from your current network provider. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the 24/7 customer support offered by Nomad, you can rest assured that assistance is always available through the live agents in the Nomad app. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Travel the Nomad way</h2>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.getnomad.app/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=macworld&amp;xcust=1-1-2375161-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Try Nomad eSIM</a></div>\n\n\n<p>So, if you’re heading off on a trip and want to use your iPhone or iPad wherever your travels may take you, a Nomad eSIM should be at the top of your list.
