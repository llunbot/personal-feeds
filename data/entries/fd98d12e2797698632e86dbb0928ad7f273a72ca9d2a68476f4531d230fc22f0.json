{"title":"Find myâ€¦ bicycle?","link":"https://arstechnica.com/reviews/2025/05/find-my-bicycle/","date":1746543270000,"content":"<p>We've reviewed some <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/the-trek-madone-slr-9-gen-8-tears-up-the-roads-and-conquers-climbs/\">pretty expensive bikes</a> here at Ars, and one of the consistent concerns we see in the comments is the fear of theft. That's a widely shared fear, based on a whole bunch of videos that describe how to hide an AirTag tracker where a potential bike thief won't notice it. There are also a number of products available that will hold a hidden AirTag in a reflector, a bike bell, or the head tube.</p>\n<p>But Apple has also made it possible for third parties to plug their devices into its \"Find My\" system, and a company called Knog has made a <a href=\"https://us.knog.com/products/scout?srsltid=AfmBOoplAT2RYBkqr2j_AFsevWZV4gV3dcRuobAiBjYdqtod9vj2LHgX\">Bluetooth bike tracker called the Scout</a> that does just that. The Scout goes well beyond tracking, though, providing a motion-sensitive alarm system that will alert you if anybody tries to move your bike.</p>\n<h2>Meet the Scout</h2>\n<p>The Scout can be attached to the frame using the screw holes normally used for a water bottle holder. Security screws make it considerably more difficult to remove. Once there, it uses Apple's Find My network to keep the owner apprised of the bike's location (Android users need not apply at the moment). If you're leaving your bike in a high-risk location, you can also use Knog's phone application to set an alarm that will be triggered if the bike is moved.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/reviews/2025/05/find-my-bicycle/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/reviews/2025/05/find-my-bicycle/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fd98d12e2797698632e86dbb0928ad7f273a72ca9d2a68476f4531d230fc22f0","category":"Tech"}
