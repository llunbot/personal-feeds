As such, the latest Blacklabel 307 &amp; 309 (27.5″ and 29″) Carbon Wheels from Reynolds look to offer improved comfort and tracking over rough terrain with a shallower rim depth of just 20.5mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reynolds tells us this 6mm reduction in rim depth has led to a rim that is almost 40% more vertically compliant. Internal width remains at 30mm, but the external width grows a little to 37mm, with a slight asymmetry to the profile that allows for more equally balanced spoke tensions between the drive and non-drive sides. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is true for all four new wheelsets released today: Blacklabel Enduro Pro, Blacklabel Enduro Expert, TR Enduro, and Blacklabel DH Expert. All see rims composed of Reynolds’ IDM Matrix, said to combine the highest-quality carbon fibers with a unique resin with exceptional impact dispersing characteristics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reynolds Enduro Wheels see just 28 spokes front and rear, largely to ensure the extra compliance of that shallower rim can actually be felt by the rider, but also to keep weight down. Meanwhile the Downhill offering runs 32 spokes in a bid to maintain a higher stiffness, and more precise ride quality as a result.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"819\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-1-800x819.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-1-800x819.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-1-293x300.jpg 293w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-1-117x120.jpg 117w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-1-768x786.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-1-1500x1536.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-1.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Reynolds Blacklabel Enduro Pro Wheels get a 30mm internal width carbon rim that is 20.5mm deep</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>The New Reynolds Enduro Wheels</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Top of the range for Enduro is the Reynolds Blacklabel Enduro Pro wheelset, retailing at £2,200 ($2,299.99 USD). This one benefits from the brand’s lightest carbon layup, referred to as the MR5 layup. The set weighs a claimed 1,834 grams in 29″, and 1,728 grams in 27.5″. Its 28 Sapim CX-Delta spokes are laced to an Industry Nine Hydra Hubset with an industry-leading engagement of 0.52°.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-2-800x534.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-2-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-2-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reynolds-Blacklabel-309-Pro-2.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Reynolds Blacklabel Enduro Pro Wheels run custom Industry Nine Hydra Hubs with 28 straight-pull spokes front and rear; the hubs have the very same proven internals as the Hydra Classic, but with a hub shell geometry specified by Hayes</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A little heavier, and a little more affordable, is the Reynolds Blacklabel Enduro Expert wheelset, priced at £1,800 ($1,899.99 USD). It gets the very same rim with the lighter MR5 carbon layup, but is laced via Sapim CX-Delta spokes to a Ringle Super Bubba X hubset offering a slower, but very respectable engagement of 4°. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could be the preferred option if intended for a bike that suffers with pedal kickback, unless of course it is paired with an <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ochain-active-spider-offers-a-low-friction-chainless-ride-feel-with-your-chain-on/\" target=\"_blank\">OChain</a>.

This one weighs a claimed 1,861 grams in 27.5″ – a claimed weight for the 29″ option has not yet been specified. The TR Enduro wheels are laced with 28 Sapim Sprint spokes, secured with EXT brass nipples, to a Ringle SRX MTN hubset. The drive mechanism sees 3 pawls engaging every 12°.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three new Enduro wheelsets from Reynolds come with CL hubs, only, but are each available with Shimano HG, MicroSpline and SRAM XD driver bodies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/reynolds-blacklabel-309-dh-expert-wheel-carbon-rim.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/reynolds-blacklabel-309-dh-expert-wheel-carbon-rim-800x800.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/reynolds-blacklabel-309-dh-expert-wheel-carbon-rim-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/reynolds-blacklabel-309-dh-expert-wheel-carbon-rim-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/reynolds-blacklabel-309-dh-expert-wheel-carbon-rim-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/reynolds-blacklabel-309-dh-expert-wheel-carbon-rim-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/reynolds-blacklabel-309-dh-expert-wheel-carbon-rim-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/reynolds-blacklabel-309-dh-expert-wheel-carbon-rim.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Reynolds Blacklabel Downhill Expert Wheel gets the same rim as the Enduro Pro and Enduro Expert Wheelset, only it is laced with 32 spokes front and rear</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>The New Reynolds Downhill Wheels</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reynolds Blacklabel Downhill Expert Wheelset is priced at £1,800 ($1,899.99 USD). It runs the very same MR5 carbon rim as the Blacklabel Enduro wheels, but here that rim is laced to the hubs via 32 Sapim Sprint spokes (J-Bend), front and rear. Hubs come in the form of Ringle Super Bubba hubs, with the option for 4° or 8° engagement, and they are 6-bolt only.
