In that post, we elaborated on a few reasons why Mistral AI models may be a good fit for you. Mistral AI offers a balance of cost and performance, fast inference speed, transparency and trust, and is accessible to a wide range of users.</p> \n<p>Today, we’re excited to announce the availability of two high-performing Mistral AI models, Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B, on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a>. Mistral AI is the 7th foundation model provider offering cutting-edge models in Amazon Bedrock, joining other leading AI companies like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/jurassic/\">AI21 Labs</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\">Anthropic</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/cohere-command-embed/\">Cohere</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/llama-2/\">Meta</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/stable-diffusion/\">Stability AI</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/titan/\">Amazon</a>. This integration provides you the flexibility to choose optimal high-performing foundation models in Amazon Bedrock.</p> \n<p>Mistral 7B is the first foundation model from Mistral AI, supporting English text generation tasks with natural coding capabilities. It is optimized for low latency with a low memory requirement and high throughput for its size. Mixtral 8x7B is a popular, high-quality, sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, that is ideal for text summarization, question and answering, text classification, text completion, and code generation.</p> \n<p>Here’s a quick look at Mistral AI models on Amazon Bedrock:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/02/28/2024-mistral-ga-rev-1-1.jpg\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1599\" /></p> \n<p><strong><span>Getting Started with Mistral AI Models</span><br /> </strong>To get started with Mistral AI models in Amazon Bedrock, first you need to get access to the models.

Following, is a sample code in Python that interacts with Amazon Bedrock Runtime APIs with AWS SDK:</p> \n<pre><code>import boto3\nimport json\n\nbedrock = boto3.client(service_name=\"bedrock-runtime\")\n\nprompt = \"&lt;s&gt;[INST] INSERT YOUR PROMPT HERE [/INST]\"\n\nbody = json.dumps({\n    \"prompt\": prompt,\n    \"max_tokens\": 512,\n    \"top_p\": 0.8,\n    \"temperature\": 0.5,\n})\n\nmodelId = \"mistral.mistral-7b-instruct-v0:2\"\n\naccept = \"application/json\"\ncontentType = \"application/json\"\n\nresponse = bedrock.invoke_model(\n    body=body,\n    modelId=modelId,\n    accept=accept,\n    contentType=contentType\n)\n\nprint(json.loads(response.get('body').read()))</code></pre> \n<p><span><strong>Mistral AI models in action<br /> </strong></span>By integrating your application with AWS SDK to invoke Mistral AI models using Amazon Bedrock, you can unlock possibilities to implement various use cases. Here are a few of my personal favorite use cases using Mistral AI models with sample prompts.
