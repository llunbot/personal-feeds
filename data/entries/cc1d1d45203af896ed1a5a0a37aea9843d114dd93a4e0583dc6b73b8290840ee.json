Scott developed the new bike to take enduro up a notch. And with an all-new 6-bar suspension design and unique rear suspension remote, they created what I see as a freeride bike for the downhills and an all-mountain trail bike for the climbs. With almost no compromises at either end of the spectrum.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Riding the new Scott Ransom 900 RC carbon enduro bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Riding-review-of-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_trailside.jpg\" alt=\"Ride Review of 2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC DH-ready carbon enduro bike, complete bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Riding-review-of-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_trailside.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Riding-review-of-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_trailside-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Riding-review-of-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_trailside-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Riding-review-of-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_trailside-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Riding-review-of-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_trailside-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Riding-review-of-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_trailside-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Riding-review-of-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_trailside-720x480.jpg 720w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption>        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Ride Review of 2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC DH-ready carbon enduro bike, complete bike\" /><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Ride Review of 2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC DH-ready carbon enduro bike, complete bike\" /><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent three long days back in mid-November riding the new bike on steep, rocky &amp; loose natural trails in Santa Coloma de Farners, just outside of Girona, Spain.

And it is what makes you really able to enjoy the 170mm of plush 6-bar rear suspension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can’t actually see the tech that makes this work. Because it happens inside the custom Fox Float X Nude EVOL rear shock. And you can’t even see that because Scott hides it inside the frame. So, instead we look at the 3-position Twin-Loc 2 remote. The two upper levers cycle you through 3 rear shock modes – Climb, Ramp Control &amp; Descend. And the lower lever is your dropper post remote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not a lockout, but rather three different shock tunes accessible at the push of a button.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Climb, Ramp Control, or Descend</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_Photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_Cory-riding.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Scott Ransom 170mm 6-bar carbon freeride enduro mountain bike, photo by Daniel Geiger, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_Photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_Cory-riding.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_Photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_Cory-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_Photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_Cory-riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_Photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_Cory-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_Photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_Cory-riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_Photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_Cory-riding-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_Photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_Cory-riding-720x480.jpg 720w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>(Photo by Daniel Geiger/Scott)</figcaption>        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"2024 Scott Ransom 170mm 6-bar carbon freeride enduro mountain bike, photo by Daniel Geiger, riding\" /><figcaption>(Photo by Daniel Geiger/Scott)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"2024 Scott Ransom 170mm 6-bar carbon freeride enduro mountain bike, photo by Daniel Geiger, riding\" /><figcaption>(Photo by Daniel Geiger/Scott)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The fully open Descend mode is built to fly.

By closing an air chamber in the rear shock, you effectively get volume spacers that you drop in at the push of a button. No change to the full 170mm of travel or your compression damping settings. The bike just becomes instantly more progressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing volume spacers to adjust your shock progression for different riding conditions isn’t really feasible for the average mountain biker. But being able to do the same thing at the flick of a switch is game-changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, the middle Ramp Control mode is a lot of fun on descents that aren’t too technical – think flowy berms and jump lines. But it’s also good for climbs that aren’t as smooth or steep.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-steep-loose-trails.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC DH-ready carbon enduro bike, climbing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-steep-loose-trails.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-steep-loose-trails-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-steep-loose-trails-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-steep-loose-trails-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-steep-loose-trails-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_climbing-steep-loose-trails-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>(Photo by Daniel Geiger/Scott)</figcaption>        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC DH-ready carbon enduro bike, climbing\" /><figcaption>(Photo by Daniel Geiger/Scott)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC DH-ready carbon enduro bike, climbing\" /><figcaption>(Photo by Daniel Geiger/Scott)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, Climb mode increases compression damping, reduces rear travel down to 130mm, and lowers the air volume for more progression.

(<em>Size Large at 15.96kg with 480g of Mallet DH pedals, a bottle cage, set up tubeless, and with a spare tube, levers &amp; chaintool inside the matchbox internal storage</em>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, that’s not superlight for a trail bike, but with a gravity-ready burly build it’s really not that heavy. My steel enduro hardtail weighs almost that with everything I carry on regular rides. And my carbon fatbike with 130mm fork, a frame pack to carry extra warm clothes, and light studded tires weighs the same at the moment. And I’m happy to pedal those slowly up endless climbs, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight is really the only compromise in Climb mode. And there don’t really feel like there are any in Ramp Control or Descend modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Transforming from Trail to Enduro to Freeride, and back again</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The transformation seems like a much bigger attitude shift than I’m used to in bikes with remote lockouts or adaptable geometry. Singling out one, I feel like the shift is significantly more that the experience I’ve had with Canyon’s innovative <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2022-canyon-strive-cfr-carbon-enduro-race-mountain-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">ShapeShifter</a> on their Strive enduro bike. Plus, I appreciate that the Ransom achieves the same concept entirely inside the shock, which feels less complicated, and less likely to deteriorate in performance over time. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_climbing.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Scott Ransom 170mm 6-bar carbon freeride enduro mountain bike, climbing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_climbing.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_climbing-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_climbing-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_climbing-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_climbing-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Scott-Ransom-170mm-6-bar-carbon-freeride-enduro-mountain-bike_climbing-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption>        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"2024 Scott Ransom 170mm 6-bar carbon freeride enduro mountain bike, climbing\" /><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"2024 Scott Ransom 170mm 6-bar carbon freeride enduro mountain bike, climbing\" /><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I pedaled up a lot on this bike. It undoubtedly is totally a reasonable climber. But internally, we got to talking about ebikes after riding this new bike, because at this price &amp; weight-level, there are some solid e-Trail eMTB options, too. For those that are itching for the assist to cram more ascents/descents in, there is a use-case for eMTB in some locales. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Ransom is simply so much more fun descending on really rough trails, that I’m happy to take a few extra minutes and sweat out a bit more on the climbs to get to my downhills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And really it would/will be a blast in the bikepark. It feels way more like a DH bike going down than most of the enduro bikes that I regularly ride at my local uplift. And way better at climbing than the other big bikes, more on par going uphill with lighter all-mountain or trail bikes. The 2024 Scott Ransom is now officially a gravity bike, but it manages to vastly improve pedal-ability at the same time thanks to Trac-Loc and user adjustable geometry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC build spec</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ride-Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_complete-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Ride Review of 2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC DH-ready carbon enduro bike, complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ride-Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_complete-bike.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ride-Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_complete-bike-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ride-Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_complete-bike-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ride-Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_complete-bike-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ride-Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_complete-bike-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ride-Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_complete-bike-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>(Photo by Daniel Geiger/Scott)</figcaption>        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Ride Review of 2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC DH-ready carbon enduro bike, complete\" /><figcaption>(Photo by Daniel Geiger/Scott)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Ride Review of 2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC DH-ready carbon enduro bike, complete\" /><figcaption>(Photo by Daniel Geiger/Scott)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC reviewed here is the top-tier 10,000€ build, with the full HMX carbon frameset, Fox Factory suspension, and a SRAM X0 Eagle AXS Transmission. While, there’s not a lot more you could ask for, even with money as no object. Perhaps a gravity-ready carbon wheelset could save a few grams. But for a bike built to smash bikepark laps and race blindly through rock gardens, the aluminum RaceFace R30 wheels are at least something to not worry about. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now do I really need all those fancy components to enjoy an enduro bike? I think there are plenty of compromises I could make to save a few bucks, and still be happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s really hard to ignore the 10,000€ pricetag of the bike, no matter how good it rides. Sure, there are a lot of more expensive bikes out there. But this is clearly far out of many riders’ budgets. There is a silver lining though…. All of the unique tech that makes this bike great, is also available at lower pricepoints. Not exactly cheap. But the 6000€ 920 &amp; 5200€ 930 have the same 3-mode rear shock function, a slightly heavier carbon &amp; alloy frame, and more affordable mechanical drivetrains. At just 1-1.5kg weight penalty.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Final Thoughts on the new Ransom</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_dropping-through-rocks.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC DH-ready carbon enduro bike, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_dropping-through-rocks.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_dropping-through-rocks-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_dropping-through-rocks-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_dropping-through-rocks-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_dropping-through-rocks-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_dropping-through-rocks-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Review-of-the-new-2024-Scott-Ransom-900-RC-DH-ready-carbon-enduro-bike_photo-by-Daniel-Geiger_dropping-through-rocks-720x480.jpg 720w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>(Photo by Daniel Geiger/Scott)</figcaption>        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC DH-ready carbon enduro bike, riding\" /><figcaption>(Photo by Daniel Geiger/Scott)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"2024 Scott Ransom 900 RC DH-ready carbon enduro bike, riding\" /><figcaption>(Photo by Daniel Geiger/Scott)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t think of a bike I’ve ridden in recent memory that was more composed and confident on the downhills than this new Scott Ransom. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I kinda fell in love with its Trac-Loc remote. Especially, riding even downhills with the rear shock in the middle Ramp Control mode was a playful blast. And I really wish this was an option on almost every big travel bike I ride – from all-mountain to DH. Then, of course, popping it into Climb mode transformed the bike completely. It didn’t drop 2kg which would have been nice, but it did make it climb much better than I anticipated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I were looking to buy a new bike for enduro racing and riding bikepark laps, this is the first bike that I would think of.
