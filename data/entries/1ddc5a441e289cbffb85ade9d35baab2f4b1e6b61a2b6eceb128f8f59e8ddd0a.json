Good news, though: according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-16/apple-iphone-17-air-foldable-iphone-details-ai-crisis-to-haunt-top-100-event-m8bl3a9c\">report</a> by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, new models are in the works but they won’t arrive for at least several more months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It had previously reported that Apple is working on a new Studio Display (codenamed J427) for release by the end of 2025 or in early 2026. In this latest report, Gurman reiterates the same information but adds “one twist” that Apple is working on a second display (codenamed J527). Gurman speculates that the second display could be “a second model with a different screen size or set of specifications,” but it’s most likely a new Pro Display XDR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">current Studio Display</a> was released two years ago and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667913/apple-pro-display-xdr-review-hands-on.html\">Pro Display XDR</a> is over five years old. While both are great products, they don’t offer several features that have been developed since their release. For example, both displays have a maximum refresh rate of 60Hz, which is acceptable for most people, but 120Hz (or even 144Hz) is offered by most high-end third-party displays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to reports on Apple’s release schedule, the company has plans to release <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2552098/m5-macbook-pro-design-processor-specs-release.html\">M5 MacBook Pros</a> in November. That could also include a new Mac Pro, which would be an appropriate time to release the new displays. However, if you can’t wait, there are plenty of great displays you can buy now that are more affordable than Apple’s offerings.
