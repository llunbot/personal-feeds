Tile's network is the equivalent of Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> network, leveraging nearby devices to locate lost items.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLife360 has what it calls a \"family safety platform\" that allows family members to keep tabs on one another with tracking software on smartphones. It's primarily used by parents to track their children and teenagers, and it has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20211105-the-parents-who-track-their-children\">raised privacy concerns</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith the Tile acquisition, Life360 founder Chris Hulls says that Life360 will be able to provide an \"all-encompassing solution\" for locating people, pets, and things with cross-platform tracking and combined service for tracking items and people. <blockquote>Individuals and families will be able to tap into Life360's flagship mobile app, a market leading app for families with features that range from communications to driving safety and location sharing. Additionally, people will be able to seamlessly leverage Tile's bluetooth-enabled finding devices trackers, which can equip nearly any item -- such as wallets, keys or remotes -- with location-based finding technology. Tile's technology is also embedded in over 50 different third-party devices, ranging from wireless earbuds and headphones to laptops to retainer cases to dog collars.</blockquote>Life360's Tile acquisition deal is valued at $205 million and it is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tile/\">Tile</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/22/life360-tile-acquisition/\">AirTag Competitor Tile Getting Acquired by Location Sharing App Life360</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airtag-competitor-tile-getting-acquired-by-location-sharing-app-life360.2324516/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WoSLedK2E24:4p-iR-o6Prc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WoSLedK2E24:4p-iR-o6Prc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"877274e698d3f9a1a32052802f0b9a7c9f895e03887666ab56ff36708c09c4f9","category":"Apple"}
