Then the new Hutchinson Challenger TLR is the tire for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new endurance replaces their long-running (and popular) Sector, Equinox, and Intensive tires with a single model for alt-road surfaces, long training miles, and all-season performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-tire-cutaway-graphics.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2228\" height=\"1249\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-tire-cutaway-graphics.jpg\" alt=\"hutchinson challenger tlr road tire cutaway graphic showing layers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-tire-cutaway-graphics.jpg 2228w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-tire-cutaway-graphics-297x166.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-tire-cutaway-graphics-800x448.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-tire-cutaway-graphics-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-tire-cutaway-graphics-768x431.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-tire-cutaway-graphics-1536x861.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-tire-cutaway-graphics-2048x1148.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-tire-cutaway-graphics-400x225.jpg 400w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Challenger TLR starts off with a dual-compound rubber, with a softer 53A compound on the edges with sipes to aid cornering traction. The center is twice as thick as their normal tires, with 2.3mm of harder 62A compound rubber to extend tread life to a claimed 10,000 kilometers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Underneath that is a triple layer of 127tpi casing, and that sandwiches their Hardshield puncture protection layers. That’s one Aramid and one Polyamide layer, placed directly under the tread cap. They say this combo resists puncture forces up to 170Nm, versus regular tires’ 80-120Nm rating.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1525\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire.jpg\" alt=\"hutchinson challenger tlr road tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire-297x226.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire-800x610.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire-120x92.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire-768x586.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire-1536x1171.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Below that is Airshield, a full bead-to-bead butyl rubber layer that provides an air-impermeable barrier, so the tire needs no sealant to hold the desired air pressure. You’ll still want to add sealant to close up any punctures, however unlikely they might be, but you don’t <em>need</em> it for the tire to hold air. Any maybe you won’t have to top it off before every ride, either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The folding beads are encased in a tougher rubber to prevent damage from chafing and add (a little) protection against pinch flats, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, basically, a tire that you should have a hard time flatting or wearing out for more than 6,300 miles. Which is at least a year’s worth of riding for most of us, likely more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire-ridden.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1527\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire-ridden.jpg\" alt=\"hutchinson challenger tlr road tire being ridden on wet road\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire-ridden.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire-ridden-297x252.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire-ridden-800x679.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire-ridden-120x102.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire-ridden-768x652.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hutchinson-challenger-tlr-road-bike-tire-ridden-1536x1303.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tradeoff? Weight.They’re about 60-100g heavier than other all-conditions tires, but for riders with nasty road conditions, frequent gravel offshoots, or unkempt shoulders, it’s probably worth it for peace of mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all the material and tech, they retail for a refreshingly affordable €59.99 for all three sizes – 700×25 (385g), 700×28 (400g) and 700×32 (450g).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://cycling.hutchinson.com/new-challenger-tubeless-the-ultimate-all-season-ultra-endurance-and-training-tyre/\" target=\"_blank\">Cycling.Hutchinson.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-hutchinson-challenger-tlr-might-be-the-longest-lasting-all-road-tire/\">New Hutchinson Challenger TLR Might be the Longest Lasting All-Road Tire</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"3e8769ed3a285d922e56e9699bf60c5e6a97c8d0efe59bfcc6b229c859190e82","category":"Cycling"}
