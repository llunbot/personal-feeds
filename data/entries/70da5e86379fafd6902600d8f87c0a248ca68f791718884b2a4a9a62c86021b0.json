Space Command initially said the event created more than 300 pieces of trackable debris. The military's ground-based radars are capable of tracking objects larger than 10 centimeters (4 inches).</p>\n<p>Later Thursday, LeoLabs, a commercial space situational awareness company, <a href=\"https://x.com/LeoLabs_Space/status/1821674976245670386\">said its radars detected at least 700 objects</a> attributed to the Chinese rocket. The number of debris fragments could rise to more than 900, LeoLabs said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041957#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041957&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"70da5e86379fafd6902600d8f87c0a248ca68f791718884b2a4a9a62c86021b0","category":"Tech"}
