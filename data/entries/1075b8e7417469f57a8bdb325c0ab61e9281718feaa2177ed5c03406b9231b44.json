This week's update also introduces weather disruption reporting, allowing drivers to mark and avoid hazards such as unplowed roads, flooding, or low visibility conditions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, arrival assistance is getting enhanced. Google Maps will now highlight nearby parking lots and prompt users to save their parking location. The app can then provide walking directions to the final destination using AR Live View navigation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA more substantial navigation update is scheduled for next month, launching in over 30 metropolitan areas. This enhancement will provide clearer visualization of lanes, crosswalks, and road signs, with a blue line indicating the correct lane position during turns and merges.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/google-maps-weather-report-1.jpg\" width=\"1672\" height=\"768\" />\r<br />\nLooking further ahead, Google has announced plans to integrate its Gemini AI technology into Maps in the coming months. This feature will allow users to ask natural language questions about locations and receive curated recommendations based on data from over 250 million places worldwide. The AI implementation will also provide summarized reviews and detailed answers about specific venues.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/\">Google Maps</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/google-maps-new-weather-alerts-navigation-tools/\">Google Maps Rolling Out These New Navigation Features This Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-rolling-out-these-new-navigation-features-this-week.2441689/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1075b8e7417469f57a8bdb325c0ab61e9281718feaa2177ed5c03406b9231b44","category":"Apple"}
