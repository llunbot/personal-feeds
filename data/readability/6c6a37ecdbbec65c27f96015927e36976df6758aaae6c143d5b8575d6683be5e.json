{"title":"Tour de France Femmes route revealed","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/tour-de-france-femmes-route-revealed/","date":1634207028000,"content":"<div><div><p>The much anticipated very first edition of the Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift was presented in Paris on Thursday by <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/marion-rousse-is-taking-charge-of-the-tour-de-france-femmes/\">newly appointed race director Marion Rousse</a>. The eight-day stage race starts on the Champs-Elysées in Paris on the same day the Tour de France Hommes ends, and then moves eastward to end with a final showdown on the Planche des Belles Filles. There is one uphill finish at the Super Planche des Belles Filles and no time trial.</p><p>The first stage on Sunday 24 July consists of twelve laps on the famous circuit in the city center of Paris. It’s a flat stage and a course well-known in the women’s peloton because the first three editions of the one-day La Course took place there. One notable difference is that there will be mountain points on offer on the Champs-Elysées for the first time ever. On the second day the race moves to the department of Seine et Marne for a 135 km flat stage from Meaux with finish in Provins. </p><p>The majestic cathedral of Reims serves as a backdrop for the start of the third stage (133 km) on Tuesday 26 July. There are five categorized climbs with the 900-metre-long climb at Mutigny which averages 12% on the local circuit around Epernay.</p><p>The race continues moving east into the French administrative region of Grand Est. The fourth stage from Troyes to Bar-sur-Aube takes place in the Champagne region and includes four sectors of gravel roads known from Paris-Tours and six categorized climbs. The total distance of stage four is 126 kilometers.</p><p>The fifth stage from Bar-Le-Duc to Saint Dié-des-Vosges is the longest in the recent history of women’s cycling. No less than 175 kilometers and three categorized climbs are on the menu on Wednesday. This stage is ten kilometers longer than the longest race day so far, stage 4 of the Giro Rosa 2020.</p><p>From the bubbly Champagne to the white wines of the Alsace as the sixth stage goes to Rosheim (126 km). 10 km from the finish line, there is a 1.3 km climb of 6.1% average gradient positioned on a local circuit – a repetitive feature seen on almost every stage of the first Tour de France Femmes.</p><p>The final weekend is the most mountainous of the race. The penultimate stage starts in Sélestat and finishes in the winter sports resort of Markstein 127 kilometers later. On the route we find the Petit Ballon (9.3km, 8.1%), the Col du Platzerwassel (7.1km, 8.3%) and the Grand Ballon d’Alsace (13.5km, 6.7%). The finish is only eight kilometers after the top of the Grand Ballon.</p><p>The final 123 km stage on Sunday 31 July starts in Lure and has an uphill finish at the Super Planche des Belles Filles, including the super steep gravel sector of 24% gradient. On the way we also find the 8.7 km Ballon d’Alsace.</p><p>Just like the men’s race, the Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift awards four distinctive jerseys with the yellow, green, polka dot and white jersey. Like Zwift, Liv also comes onboard as sponsor for the women’s race, supporting the white jersey for best young rider. There was no announcement about the prize money to be awarded in the Tour de France Femmes.</p><p>More to come.</p></div></div>","author":"José Been","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"6c6a37ecdbbec65c27f96015927e36976df6758aaae6c143d5b8575d6683be5e","category":"Cycling"}
