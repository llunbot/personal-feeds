Nintendo set out to partially fix that today, releasing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6qna-ZCbxA\">a new video</a> in which Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma showed off some of Link's new abilities in a guided 10-minute gameplay presentation.</p>\n<p>The most impactful new ability on display was called \"Fuse,\" which lets Link put together two disparate objects to create a new one with a brand-new effect. In the simplest example of this, Aonuma fused together a basic tree branch (which breaks incredibly easily even during simple fights) with a rock, creating a makeshift hammer with a lot more power and durability.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/zelda1.png\"><img alt=\"Tree branch + boulder = makeshift hammer.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/zelda1-640x360.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/zelda1-1280x720.png 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/zelda1.png\">Tree branch + boulder = makeshift hammer.</a> (credit: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6qna-ZCbxA\">Nintendo</a>)</p></div>\n<p>Unlike in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, where Link had to hunt for the most powerful weapons, the focus here will be on creating those weapons from component parts, Aonuma said. Fusing a long stick with a pitchfork can give you a longer attack range, for instance, and fusing various materials to arrows can create useful side-effects like freezing powers or a homing capability.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927291#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927291&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"13f9cd1a9ce803ba2d619ac3bfbba2c536559545f09e20a304e3f8bec881a5b6","category":"Tech"}
