Here’s what we think is coming from Apple in March.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware releases: March event with new Macs, iPads, and more?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve long heard that Apple is targeting March for several important new product releases—possibly at its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">first event of the year</a>. The M3 MacBook Air (in both 13- and 15-inch varieties) should be on the way but don’t expect much more than an upgrade from the M2 to the M3 processor. The laptops will probably get Wi-Fi 6E support but we don’t expect any other changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad lineup gets shaken up a little more. First, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">iPad Air is expected to get two major new changes</a>: the first is the availability of a new 12.9-inch model, and the second is a bump to the M2 processor. Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 are also expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/14-inch-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">iPad Pro will get even more changes</a>. The new models will sport M3 processors, new OLED displays, and a slimmer design. The camera is rumored to be moved to the top edge when held horizontally (landscape), and there’s a rumor of a new redesigned Magic Keyboard. There might even be some sort of MagSafe charging system, though it’s unclear if this refers to the iPad-style MagSafe connector or the iPhone one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple may introduce these products at an event in March—some years have them and some don’t. The March events of years past have been in the 2nd, 3rd, and last week of the month. There was even a spring event in April one year, but that was due to pandemic-related delays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t heard of the imminent release of other products like AirPods, HomePods, Apple TV, or even an iPhone SE (which usually releases in the spring). But Apple is fond of introducing a new iPhone color in the spring, so it wouldn’t surprise us a new shade for the iPhone 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has until March 6 to comply with the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, which requires the company to allow apps to be distributed through avenues outside the App Store and to allow apps to accept payment processors other than Apple’s for digital goods and services, among other things. All that is coming in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2218208/ios-17-4-beta-eu-app-store-changes-features-install.html\">iOS 17.4</a>, which just got a release candidate at the end of February. Expect the iOS 17.4 release (and associated iPadOS, tvOS, and macOS updates) to drop on March 4 or 5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 17.4:</strong> ALong with the EU changes, this release also includes new emojis, virtual card numbers for Apple Cash accounts, transcripts in Podcasts, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‌<strong>tvOS <strong>17.4</strong>:</strong> Apple was going to introduce SharePlay for Apple Music in this release, but pulled it during the beta process. It’s unclear if it will return in the final release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS 14.4:</strong> This release adds the new emoji as you’ll find in iOS and iPadOS 17.4, along with the improved <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2243580/imessage-security-protocol-post-quantum-cryptography-level-3.html\">iMessage security system</a>. It will likely launch in mid-March</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in TK.
