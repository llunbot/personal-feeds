A layer of ice saved them from the depths and allowed scientists a peek into the birth of the solar system.</p>\n<p>Nearly 60 years later, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission returned from space with a sample of an asteroid named Bennu, similar to the one that rained rocks over Revelstoke. Our research team <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08495-6\">has published a chemical analysis</a> of those samples, providing insight into how some of the ingredients for life may have first arrived on Earth.</p>\n<p>Born in the years bracketing the Revelstoke meteorite’s fall, the two of us have spent our careers in the meteorite collections of the <a href=\"https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/mineral-sciences/collections-overview\">Smithsonian Institution</a> in Washington, DC, and the <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/services/collections/mineralogy/meteorites.html\">Natural History Museum</a> in London.
