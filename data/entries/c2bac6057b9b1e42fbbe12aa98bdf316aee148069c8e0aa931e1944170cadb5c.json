It's a robust, extremely infectious virus that spreads via the nauseating fecal-oral route. Infected people spew billions of virus particles in their vomit and diarrhea, and shedding can last weeks. The particles aren't easily killed by hand sanitizers and can linger on surfaces for up to two weeks. Exposure to as few as 10 virus particles can spark an infection. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/data-research/index.html\">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,</a> norovirus causes an average of between 19 and 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis in the US every year, leading to 109,000 hospitalizations and 900 deaths. This racks up an economic burden estimated to be $2 billion to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32671397/\">$10.6 billion</a>.</p>\n<h2>Vaccine design</h2>\n<p>For most, the gut-busting bug is miserable but usually over in a few days. But older people—especially those with underlying medical conditions—are vulnerable to severe outcomes. About 90 percent of people who die from a norovirus infection are people age 65 or older who live in long-term care facilities.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/saliva-that-fights-norovirus-experimental-oral-vaccine-is-nothing-to-spit-at/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/saliva-that-fights-norovirus-experimental-oral-vaccine-is-nothing-to-spit-at/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c2bac6057b9b1e42fbbe12aa98bdf316aee148069c8e0aa931e1944170cadb5c","category":"Tech"}
