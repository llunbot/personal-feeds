Heavily inspired by the brand’s performance road bikes, the Rave SLR ups tyre clearance to 42mm and blends racing with gravel geometries.</p>\n<p>The Rave SLR will be available in a variety of complete builds with different groupsets, cockpits and wheels available to adapt it from a gravel machine to an all-road bike. Complete bikes are available in 1× or 2× builds with groupsets from Shimano, SRAM or Campagnolo.</p>\n<p>Wilier’s Rave SLR is unashamedly high end, with superbike pricing to match. The least expensive bike in the range from Wilier Triestina is built with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review/\">Campagnolo Ekar</a>, a carbon bar and Campagnolo Shamal wheels, and will set you back £8,680 / €8,300.</p>\n<p>The priciest is the road-specific version of the bike, at £11,350 / €11,000, which is fitted with the new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-dura-ace-di2-r9200/\">Shimano Dura-Ace R9200</a> 12-speed groupset.</p>\n<p>So far we know what wheels and groupsets will be specced on the new Rave SLR, but Wilier has said full specifications are subject to last-minute change due to continued supply chain issues.</p>\n<h2>One frame, two bikes?</h2>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/11/WilierRaveADV-1429-2945aff.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Wilier Rave SLR can be set up as a gravel bike…</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Wilier</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/11/WilierRaveADV-4292-668c694.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>…or it can be set up as a road bike.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Wilier</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nRegardless of whether you opt for the gravel or all-road version of the Rave SLR, underneath the finishing kit and components is the same carbon fibre frameset.\n<p>Wilier says the Race frameset uses the same construction as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/wilier-filante-slr-review/\">Filante SLR</a> and the Wilier 0 SLR, which sees carbon fibre mixed with liquid crystal polymers in order to create what the brand claims is a lightweight and reactive frame.</p>\n<p>The result is a claimed weight of 950g for the frame and 415g for the fork in an unspecified spec and size. This isn’t a great deal heavier than the Filante SLR, which has a claimed frame weight of 870g.</p>\n<h2>Wilier Rave SLR geometry</h2>\n<p>For the Rave SLR, Wilier says it started with its established <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\" target=\"_blank\">road race bike geometry</a> then introduced aspects of its gravel and endurance geometries.</p>\n<p>The result is a 71-degree head tube and 74-degree seat tube for a size medium, which for a point of comparison, is slightly more relaxed and gravel-friendly than the new and similarly endurance-inspired <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-bmc-roadmachine-x/\">BMC Roadmachine X</a>.</p>\n<p>Compared to its road race bikes, Wilier has also increased stack height and reduced reach on the Rave SLR to provide a more comfortable fit.</p>\n<p>Chainstay length varies across the six sizes (XS to XXL) from 421mm to 427mm. The wheelbase figure also ranges from 997mm in an extra small to 1,051mm in an extra-large.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿Size</th><th>XS</th><th>S</th><th>M</th><th>L</th><th>XL</th><th>XXL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Seat tube angle (degrees)</b></td><td>75</td><td>74.5</td><td>74</td><td>73.5</td><td>73</td><td>72.5</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Head tube angle (degrees)</b></td><td>70</td><td>70</td><td>71</td><td>71</td><td>71.5</td><td>72</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Chainstay (mm)</b></td><td>421</td><td>422</td><td>423</td><td>423</td><td>425</td><td>427</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat tube (mm)</b></td><td>450</td><td>480</td><td>500</td><td>520</td><td>540</td><td>560</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Top tube (mm)</b></td><td>510</td><td>527</td><td>545</td><td>561</td><td>579</td><td>597</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Head tube (mm)</b></td><td>98</td><td>118</td><td>134</td><td>154</td><td>172</td><td>190</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Wheelbase (mm)</b></td><td>997</td><td>1,012</td><td>1,017</td><td>1,031</td><td>1,041</td><td>1,051</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Stack (mm)</b></td><td>513</td><td>532</td><td>551</td><td>570</td><td>589</td><td>608</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Reach (mm)</b></td><td>370</td><td>377</td><td>384</td><td>391</td><td>398</td><td>405</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<h2>Rave SLR details and differences</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Rave borrows many details from Wilier’s race bikes, including a D-shaped seatpost.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wilier</i></span></div>\n<p>At 42mm, the Rave SLR’s tyre clearance isn’t super generous, with 45mm+ becoming pretty standard for many gravel bikes.</p>\n<p>However, 42mm doesn’t strike us as abnormal on a bike like this considering the emphasis is on the faster, racier end of the gravel spectrum. For riders looking for more tyre clearance, Wilier also has the Jena, which is a more adventurous gravel bike overall.</p>\n<p>Beyond construction, the Rave SLR frame has other nods to Wilier’s top race bikes, including completely internal cable routing, a D-section seatpost and the same clamp design as the 0 SLR.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/11/WilierStillBici_408-1da968e.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The gravel version of the Rave SLR has this funky integrated cockpit with a split, v-shaped stem.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Wilier</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/11/WilierStillBici_350-6ca7fa6.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The chains tay protector has the Wilier logo as a pattern. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Wilier</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe bike is built around Mavic’s Speed Release thru-axle System, which also features on the Filante and 0 SLR. This system means the thru-axle does not have to be removed completely from the hub body for the wheel to be removed and is said to reduce wheel changing time by seven seconds.\n<p>This is a pretty negligible amount of time when you’re just out riding your bike for the fun of it, but speedy wheel changes and less hassle with thru-axles is not to be shrugged at.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike comes in three different gravel builds, including one with Campagnolo Ekar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wilier</i></span></div>\n<p>The main difference between the gravel and all-road versions of the Rave SLR is the cockpit. Both are monocoque carbon fibre and provide room for cable integration, but they differ in shape.</p>\n<p>The gravel-specific Rave SLR has Wilier’s 390g J-Bar, which was first launched with the Jena, and has a distinctive split, V-shaped stem. The all-road version comes with Wilier’s 330g Zero Bar, which has a more traditional stem design and is specced on the 0 SLR.</p>\n<p>Another difference between the road and gravel versions of the bike is the gearing. All the road models come with 2× groupsets whereas the gravel versions come with either 1× or 2×.</p>\n<h2>Wilier Rave SLR road</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Wilier Rave SLR will be available with Shimano’s new Dura-Ace groupset.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The Wiler Rave SLR road will be available in three builds all with the Zero Bar and Wilier’s own SLR 42 KC carbon wheels.</p>\n<p>The bike will either come with the new Shimano Dura-Ace R9200 or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-ultegra-di2-r8100/\">Shimano Ultegra R8100</a> 12-speed groupset or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-force-etap-axs-review/\">SRAM Force eTap AXS</a>.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Wilier Rave SLR road with Shimano Dura-Ace R9200:</strong> £11,350 / €11,000</li>\n<li><strong>Wilier Rave SLR road with Shimano Ultegra R8100:</strong> £9,300 / €9,000</li>\n<li><strong>Wilier Rave SLR road with SRAM Force eTap AXS:</strong> £9,300 / €9,000</li>\n</ul><h2>Wilier Rave SLR gravel</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> On one gravel build, the Ekar groupset is matched with Campagnolo wheels.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The Race SLR builds are tailored towards gravel and come with a bigger mix of components than the road bike versions.</p>\n<p>Wilier has specced the three builds with gravel-specific groupsets.
