Thomas Schmall, VW's board member in charge of technology, told <a href=\"https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/auto-verkehr/vw-vorstand-schmall-die-zukunft-gehoert-der-e-mobilitaet-19936676.html\">a German newspaper</a> that \"building battery cell factories is not an end to itself\" and that a goal of 200 GWh of lithium-ion cells by 2030 was not set in stone.</p>\n<p>It's a bit too simplistic to say that all new technologies conform to the now-infamous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle\">Gartner hype cycle</a>, but it's hard not to think of that squiggly line when discussing EVs. After years of hearing lofty goals of all-electric lineups and an end to internal combustion engines from OEMs, Tesla's skyrocketing valuation got investors interested in electrification, and for a while, things <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/06/meet-the-lordstown-endurance-a-new-52500-electric-work-truck/\">just went mad</a>.</p>\n<p>But the promised <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/general-motors-announces-new-battery-platform-claims-100kwh-soon/\">fall in battery costs</a> never really materialized, and in the US, EVs still command a price premium, at least for the first owner. The initial hype, coupled with the limited availability of new models, saw dealers load the cars and trucks they could get with hefty markups, further alienating potential customers. And now, when those markups and inventory shortages are mostly a thing of the past, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS\">interest rates</a> have soared.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044998#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044998&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
