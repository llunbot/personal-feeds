This is very important not only to the world of embedded devices, which benefits directly of this flexibility, but also to the whole WebKit ecosystem in general by providing a broader use base for our beloved Web engine.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, feel free to check regularly the <a href=\"https://wpewebkit.org/blog\">WPE WebKit blog</a> for new installments of the series, where articles on different topics will be published in the future.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Blog – WebKit","siteHash":"7f8dbea0b8f53db2e11a2faa08c6dca9954c01638d09a2ce585b77a60d10f7a1","entryHash":"7333a2c52af1509ca792ab4114449e37889e0a12d8d96eaed309589a675ce9b8","category":"Tech"}
