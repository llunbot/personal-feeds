Some, like Nikkei, claimed it will have new health sensors, but others like Bloomberg's Mark Gurman have said that this year's model will offer no major new hardware features amidst production constraints.</p>\n<p>Topping off a week of debate on the subject, The Wall Street Journal today <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-blood-pressure-measure-wrist-thermometer-in-watch-11630501201\">published</a> a report that claims that several major new health-sensing features are coming to the watch—just not <em>this</em> year's model.</p>\n<p>According to the Journal's sources, a future Apple Watch that is not this year's Series 7 model will include more advanced sleep tracking, like the ability to detect sleep apnea.
