Firstly, they claim that the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max will retain the same 1/1.28-inch 48-megapixel sensor as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNumerous reports from sources including the analysts <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/14/iphone-15-and-15-plus-48mp-camera/\">Jeff Pu</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/26/kuo-iphone-15-iphone-15-plus-feature-48mp-camera/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> say that the two standard ‌iPhone 15‌ models are set to be upgraded to 48-megapixels just like the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max. According to Digital Chat Station, while the non-Pro models will receive the upgrade to 48-megapixels, they will continue to have a smaller stacked CMOS image sensor (CIS) than the Pro models at 1/1.5-inches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> and ‌iPhone 14‌ Plus feature a 12-megapixel sensor that is 1/1.9-inches in size. This means that the standard ‌iPhone 15‌ models could gain a 27% larger sensor – a substantial increase, but still not equal to the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models. In May, Digital Chat Station <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/28/iphone-16-pro-size-increase-camera-upgrades/\">reported</a> that the next ‌iPhone‌ sensor size increase for the Pro models is set to occur in 2024, increasing from 1/1.28-inches to 1/1.14-inches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA larger image sensor offers improved image quality by capturing more light, leading to greater detail and less noise, especially in low-light conditions. It also provides a wider dynamic range and better color accuracy, resulting in more professional and visually appealing photos.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/27/iphone-15-still-to-have-smaller-sensor-than-pros/\">iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus Could Still Have Smaller Camera Sensor Than Pro Models Despite Upgrade to 48MP</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-and-iphone-15-plus-could-still-have-smaller-camera-sensor-than-pro-models-despite-upgrade-to-48mp.2397053/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1bf8a06be0528a0b1a3dd58d3d90fe8fc522b2352c574300ca1bd6d48034a6da","category":"Apple"}
