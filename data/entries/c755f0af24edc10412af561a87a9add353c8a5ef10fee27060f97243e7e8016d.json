The fourth beta comes two weeks after Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/apple-releases-macos-monterey-beta-3/\">released the third macOS Monterey beta</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/macOS-Monterey-on-MBP-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nRegistered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and once the appropriate profile is installed, betas will be available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs with all new betas, Apple recommends not installing the new macOS update on a primary machine because it is early release software and could have bugs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌macOS Monterey‌ introduces Universal Control, a feature that lets a single mouse, trackpad, and keyboard be used across multiple Mac or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> devices, plus there's a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> to Mac feature.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSafari has been redesigned with a new tab bar (with a toggle <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/macos-monterey-safari-redesign/\">for two different designs</a> as of the third beta) and support for Tab Groups, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> has gained spatial audio, a Portrait Mode on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Macs, and Voice Isolation for cutting out background noise. There's also a new SharePlay ‌FaceTime‌ feature that lets Apple users watch TV, listen to music, and share their screens with one another.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nShared With You, a separate feature, keeps track of the music, links, podcasts, news, and photos that people are sent in Messages, highlighting it in the relevant apps. Notes has a new Quick Note feature for jotting down thoughts, and collaboration is easier with mentions and an Activity View.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Shortcuts app from iOS is now available on the Mac, and Focus helps people stay on task by cutting out background distractions. There's an updated Maps app with a whole slew of new features, and with Live Text, Macs can now detect text in photos or provide details on animals, art, landmarks, plants, and more in images.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMail Privacy Protection hides IP and prevents tracking through invisible pixels, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Private Relay keeps Safari browsing protected. There are many other new features in ‌macOS Monterey‌, with a full rundown available in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">our macOS Monterey roundup</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the last ‌macOS Monterey‌ Beta, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/macos-monterey-safari-redesign/\">changed the default design</a> of the Safari tab bar following multiple usability complaints. There's now a dedicated address bar at the top of the Safari window, with tabs arranged below it, rather than an all-in-one integrated design. Those who preferred the original design can use the View menu to toggle off \"Show Separate Tab Bar.\"<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/apple-seeds-macos-monterey-beta-4/\">Apple Seeds Fourth Beta of macOS 12 Monterey to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-beta-of-macos-12-monterey-to-developers.2305672/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wVazb3sNiE4:BT-7dZw7xRQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wVazb3sNiE4:BT-7dZw7xRQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/wVazb3sNiE4\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c755f0af24edc10412af561a87a9add353c8a5ef10fee27060f97243e7e8016d","category":"Apple"}
