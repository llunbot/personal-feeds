The videos were later posted to Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1632404593698279425\">by ShrimpApplePro</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/URedditor/status/1632402445832691712\">Unknownz21</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-15-Pro-Front-Glass-Panel-Leak.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /><div><em>iPhone 14 Pro front glass (left) vs. iPhone 15 Pro front glass (right) via Bilibili</em></div>\r<br />\nAs <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/21/iphone-15-pro-ultra-thin-curved-bezels/\">previously rumored</a>, the videos appear to confirm that the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will feature even thinner bezels around the display compared to the previous generation, but the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus bezels do not appear to have any noticeable changes. The bezels on all four iPhone 15 models are also expected to be slightly curved around the edges, similar to the iPhone 11 series.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe videos also appear to confirm that the Dynamic Island will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/18/dynamic-island-all-iphone-15-models-rumor/\">expanded to all four iPhone 15 models</a>, marking the end of the notch on Apple's higher-end iPhones. The Dynamic Island is currently limited to the iPhone 14 Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShrimpApplePro said they were able to confirm with a source that the front glass panels are authentic parts for the iPhone 15 lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-15-Front-Glass-Leak.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /><div><em>iPhone 15 series via Douyin</em></div>\r<br />\nWith even thinner bezels around the display, the iPhone 15 Pro models could have a similar appearance as the Apple Watch Series 7 and Series 8. Rumors suggest the Pro models will also feature a titanium frame instead of stainless steel, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-15-pro-solid-state-volume-rocker/\">solid-state volume, mute, and power buttons</a> that do not physically move when pressed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce its next iPhone lineup in September as usual.
