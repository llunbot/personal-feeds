In <a href=\"https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/rockstar-games-announces-grand-theft-auto-vi-coming-2025\">a press release</a> accompanying <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-confirms-many-things-including-its-florida-vibes/\">last night's earlier-than-scheduled trailer launch</a>, Rockstar specifically says it is \"proud to announce that <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> is coming to PlayStation 5 computer entertainment systems and Xbox Series X|S games and entertainment systems in 2025.\"</p>\n<p>The explicit lack of any immediate PC release plans in that statement shouldn't be a shock to longtime Rockstar Games watchers. Sure, the 2D, top-down <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> actually launched on Windows and MS-DOS(!) a few months before the more popular port to PlayStation in 1998. And the game's 1999 sequel debuted on PlayStation and Windows on the same day.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gta-update.001.png\"><img alt=\"When it comes to major 3D releases, Rockstar clearly prioritizes console launches over PC ports.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gta-update.001-640x480.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gta-update.001.png 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gta-update.001.png\">When it comes to major 3D releases, Rockstar clearly prioritizes console launches over PC ports.</a> </p></div>\n<p>Since 2000, though, Rockstar has clearly prioritized its console releases over any PC ports. When one of Rockstar's console games is released on the PC, the port tends to come anywhere from five months to over two full years after the first console release, according to an Ars analysis. Even <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> DLC like \"The Lost and the Damned\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" hit the PC well after their console launchesâ€”420 days and 166 days, respectively.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988635#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988635&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aa4b5c2d6589baf2b2f33d312d2ee44fc5be5f331dc518656ce30098888413a2","category":"Tech"}
