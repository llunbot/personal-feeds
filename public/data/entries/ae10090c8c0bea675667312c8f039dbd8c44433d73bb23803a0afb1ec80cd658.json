Nothing wrong with that. But if you have champagne tastes on a champagne budget, then the latest limited edition Shimano S-Phyre RC903S road shoe might be right up your alley.</span></p>\n<p><span>Late last year, Shimano dropped an update to the popular S-Phyre road shoe. The latest version features metal BOA Li2 dials and an updated forefoot lacing pattern that crosses like a figure 8 pattern. The <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2022/09/shimano-announces-its-fourth-generation-s-phyre-shoes/\">S-Phyre RC903</a> shoe itself was a small update over the previous <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/10/shimano-s-phyre-sh-rc902-road-shoe-review-messing-with-success/\">S-Phyre RC902</a>, but there certainly was no champagne colorway until now, launched in time for Spring Classics.</span></p>\n<p><span>This latest edition of the S-Phyre RC903S road shoe weighs a quoted 241g in a size 42. Sizing availability varies by region. Both standard and wide sizes span from 36 to 48, with half sizes available from 37 to 47, though there is no word on women’s specific size availability. </span></p>\n<p><span>I’m a big fan of Shimano S-Phyre shoes, particularly as someone with a wider forefoot and a narrower heel. The Li2 dials are a treat to use as well. While I am not the biggest fan of gold shoes, we’re sure this special edition will find many a happy home. </span></p>\n<p><span>Expect to pay US $450  / €359.95 / AU $649.95 for your champagne tastes.
