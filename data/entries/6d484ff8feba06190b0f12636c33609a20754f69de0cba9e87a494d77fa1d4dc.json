The Bike Friday All-Packa was really cool looking and obviously <a href=\"https://bikefriday.com/product/bike-friday-all-packa/\" target=\"_blank\">ready for adventure</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A foldable, purpose-built bikepacking bike makes a ton of sense. After talking to the guy in charge of design and production, Willie Hatfield as well as the President of Bike Friday, Hanna Scholz, I come to find out that we share a lot of values and opinions on the state of our industry. Let me tell you, they “get it”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bike Friday’s company mission is to “<em>Be a company with a conscience, offering elegant transportation solutions for modern world problems. Passionately build high-quality, versatile bicycles, personalized to empower people, with freedom and convenience, to ride anywhere on a bike that fits them</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bike Friday All-Packa</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-custom-Take-a-Trip-frame-bag.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-custom-Take-a-Trip-frame-bag-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Bike Friday All-Packa custom Take a Trip frame bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-custom-Take-a-Trip-frame-bag-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-custom-Take-a-Trip-frame-bag-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-custom-Take-a-Trip-frame-bag-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-custom-Take-a-Trip-frame-bag-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-custom-Take-a-Trip-frame-bag-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-custom-Take-a-Trip-frame-bag.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c.

The All-Packa is built to run tires up to 2.4″ wide. It also sports some geo tweaks for better-loaded, off-road handling. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-back-anything-cage-and-bag.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-back-anything-cage-and-bag-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Bike Friday All-Packa back anything cage and bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-back-anything-cage-and-bag-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-back-anything-cage-and-bag-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-back-anything-cage-and-bag-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-back-anything-cage-and-bag-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-back-anything-cage-and-bag-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-back-anything-cage-and-bag.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Good use of the Salsa Anything Cage</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-anything-cage-and-bag.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-anything-cage-and-bag-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Bike Friday All-Packa anything cage and bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-anything-cage-and-bag-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-anything-cage-and-bag-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-anything-cage-and-bag-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-anything-cage-and-bag-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-anything-cage-and-bag-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-anything-cage-and-bag.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom-built in Eugene, Oregon, to your size and color choice, the All-Packa is ready for adventures and expeditions far and wide. A bikepacking bike that folds quickly would shine in so many different travel situations. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-foldable-seat-mast.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-foldable-seat-mast-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Bike Friday All-Packa foldable seat mast\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-foldable-seat-mast-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-foldable-seat-mast-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-foldable-seat-mast-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-foldable-seat-mast-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-foldable-seat-mast-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-foldable-seat-mast.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It would make making traveling by bus, train, or cab, easier than with a full-sized bike. You can fold it down to fit in the back of your overland vehicle, adventure van, or even on top of a pack raft while navigating a river. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-beefy-2.4-knobbies.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-beefy-2.4-knobbies-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Bike Friday All-Packa beefy 2.4 knobbies\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-beefy-2.4-knobbies-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-beefy-2.4-knobbies-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-beefy-2.4-knobbies-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-beefy-2.4-knobbies-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-beefy-2.4-knobbies-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-beefy-2.4-knobbies.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-front-knobbies.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-front-knobbies-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Bike Friday All-Packa front knobbies\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-front-knobbies-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-front-knobbies-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-front-knobbies-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-front-knobbies-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-front-knobbies-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-front-knobbies.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the 20×2.4″ tires, I’m sure the All-Packa is a great “dirt rambler” as well, ready for unpaved excursions. While it may not be the most shreddable bike for super techy trails, it is a bike that was designed to tramp around the local logging roads and flowy singletrack of Oregon. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-packalope-bar.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-packalope-bar-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Bike Friday All-Packa packalope bar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-packalope-bar-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-packalope-bar-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-packalope-bar-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-packalope-bar-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-packalope-bar-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-packalope-bar.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Packalope handlebars come stock on the All-Packa</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Using 30 years of experience building customized travel bikes, the Bike Friday All-Packa is custom-built by hand to fit you perfectly, and optimized for the key needs of dirt and gravelbikepacking.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-dropper-bar-e1694792224296.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"459\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-dropper-bar-e1694792224296-800x459.jpeg\" alt=\"Bike Friday All-Packa dropper bar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-dropper-bar-e1694792224296-800x459.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-dropper-bar-e1694792224296-297x170.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-dropper-bar-e1694792224296-120x69.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-dropper-bar-e1694792224296-768x441.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bike-Friday-All-Packa-dropper-bar-e1694792224296.jpeg 1276w\" /></a><figcaption>The All-Packa can run a dropper post. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>All-Packa Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fits most bikepacking bags on the market with three-packs (3 bottle braze-ons) on the seat mast, fork legs, down tube, and four-pack on the top tube</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clearance for 20 in x 2.4 in tires.
