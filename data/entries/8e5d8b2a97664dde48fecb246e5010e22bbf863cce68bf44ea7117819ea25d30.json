And if you’re not running the betas, you need to know that Apple just shipped a slew of updates to fix some critical security holes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All told, Apple pushed eight updates on Wednesday: iOS 16.5.1 and iPadOS 16.5.1; iOS 15.7.7 and iPadOS 15.7.7; macOS Ventura 13.4.1, macOS Monterey 12.6.7, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.8; and watchOS 9.5.2 and watchOS 8.8.1. That covers more than a decade of devices going back to 2013 and includes the iPhone 6s, Apple Watch Series 3, and the original 12-inch MacBook. All of the updates fix the same vulnerability:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kernel</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Impact:</strong> An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited against versions of iOS released before iOS 15.7.</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> An integer overflow was addressed with improved input validation.</li><li><strong>CVE-2023-32434:</strong> Georgy Kucherin (@kucher1n), Leonid Bezvershenko (@bzvr_), and Boris Larin (@oct0xor) of Kaspersky</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/21/apple_patches_triangledb_spyware/&amp;xcust=1-1-1963809-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">The Register</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/zero-day-alert-apple-releases-patches.html&amp;xcust=1-1-1963809-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Hacker News</a>, this update fixes the flaw exploited by the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1940315/imessage-exploit-ios-15-7-malicious-attachment-zero-click.html\">“Operation Triangulation” campaign</a> that was able to use iMessage to deliver a “malicious attachment” that then transmitted sensitive information including audio recordings, photos, and geolocation data. The exploit, dubbed <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://securelist.com/triangledb-triangulation-implant/110050/&amp;xcust=1-1-1963809-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">TriangleDB</a> is known to have been exploited in versions of iOS earlier than 15.7, but the flaw can be found in all of Apple’s devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the iOS, iPadOS, and macOS Ventura updates include a fix for a WebKit flaw that also may have been exploited:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WebKit</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Impact:</strong> Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> A type confusion issue was addressed with improved checks.<br /><strong>CVE-2023-32439:</strong> an anonymous researcher (WebKit Bugzilla: 256567)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>None of the updates include any other security patches. However, the iOS 16.5.1 release notes say it includes a fix for an issue that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1925776/ios-16-5-bug-stops-apple-adapter-working-iphone-ipad.html\">prevents charging</a> with the Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter.</p>\n\niOS, MacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8e5d8b2a97664dde48fecb246e5010e22bbf863cce68bf44ea7117819ea25d30","category":"Apple"}
