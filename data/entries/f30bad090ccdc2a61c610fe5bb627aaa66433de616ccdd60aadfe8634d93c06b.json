Photos: Thomas Jullien</p>\n<div>\n      <p> Jake Catterall is no stranger to endurance events, his Instagram bio proudly lists some of his achievements including a 200km run, two Ironman events and a 5K time <a href=\"/in-depth/9211/tom-pidcock-and-the-case-of-his-curious-5km-run\">that would rival Tom Pidcock</a>. But even for a man of his experience, some challenges are daunting.</p>\n<p>Catterall decided – of his own free will – to ride an entire lap of Iceland in one go, over 1,300km without stopping.</p>\n<p>Hats off, though, because he did it. Pushing through the island's less than ideal weather conditions he ploughed on to complete the ride in 63 hours: that's over two and a half days.</p>\n<p>The total distance according to his <a href=\"/tags/strava\">Strava</a> came to 1,339km, with 9,557m of elevation, an average speed of 25.3kmh and over 25,000 calories burned.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9848/cycling-an-entire-lap-of-iceland-in-one-ride-images#23\"><p><span>Image 24 of</span> 29</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/dscf6080.jpg?itok=IAZ5zVsF\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 24 of </span>29</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>Obviously it was never going to be easy, but from his account, it didn't seem like Catterall had luck in his favour.</p>\n<p>Within six hours of the 19:00 start he was falling asleep on the bike. He was riding in a strong headwind going into mountains for the first 300km. The temperature dipped below 3°C and he got caught in a storm that brought strong rain and side winds. He lost vision in his left eye for around 100km.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8632/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Tour de France 2021</a></div>    </div></div><p>\n'I'm a big believer in mental strength and I'm stoic at heart, so I started to deploy all of my learning from the year of training I did,' Catterall says.</p>\n<p>'One way I got out of this dip was to find a mantra that would fuel me with energy. I was in agony and asking myself a lot of questions and kept coming back to the same statement: \"Dude, you just have to break through this part, and you'll be fine.\"</p>\n<p>'Break through was the mantra I needed. I started to repeat it over and over again, I said it 10,000 times, every other pedal stroke.'</p>\n<p>He had the whole thing filmed too so if you want to check out more of his journey, head to his Instagram page: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jakecatterall/\" target=\"_blank\">jakecatterall</a>. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9848/cycling-an-entire-lap-of-iceland-in-one-ride-images\">Cycling an entire lap of Iceland in one ride images</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>7 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9848%2Fcycling-an-entire-lap-of-iceland-in-one-ride-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Cycling%20an%20entire%20lap%20of%20Iceland%20in%20one%20ride%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9848%2Fcycling-an-entire-lap-of-iceland-in-one-ride-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Cycling%20an%20entire%20lap%20of%20Iceland%20in%20one%20ride%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9848%2Fcycling-an-entire-lap-of-iceland-in-one-ride-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Cycling%20an%20entire%20lap%20of%20Iceland%20in%20one%20ride%20images&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9848%2Fcycling-an-entire-lap-of-iceland-in-one-ride-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9848/cycling-an-entire-lap-of-iceland-in-one-ride-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 29</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/drone.jpg?itok=zaZqXUlR\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f30bad090ccdc2a61c610fe5bb627aaa66433de616ccdd60aadfe8634d93c06b","category":"Cycling"}
