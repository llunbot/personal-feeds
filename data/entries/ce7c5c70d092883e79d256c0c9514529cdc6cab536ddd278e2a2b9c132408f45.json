Children ages 2 to 5 will have three races in which to test their balance bike skills: A Quad Eliminator, a Slalom, and a Downhill event. According to the event website, the riders that accumulate the most points in their category over the three races will be crowned the winner on Sunday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pinkbike Balance Bike World Championships are a part of the festivities at the GT Malverns Classic — a mountain bike festival with a plethora of races for all ages. Assuming you and your kiddo can make your way to merry old England, the balance bike tournament only costs £15 to enter. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Balance-1.3.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"532\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Balance-1.3-800x532.jpeg\" alt=\"two toddlers on balance bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Balance-1.3-800x532.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Balance-1.3-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Balance-1.3-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Balance-1.3-768x511.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Balance-1.3-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Balance-1.3.jpeg 1024w\" /></a><figcaption>Photos provided for use by Malverns Classic</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pop over to the <a href=\"https://malvernsclassic.com/balance-bike-rules/\" target=\"_blank\">GT Malverns Classic website</a> for more entry details. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as long as we’re talking balance bikes, now seems like a good time to point out that World Strider Day is right around the corner. <a href=\"https://striderbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Strider</a> is a South Dakota-based, balance-bike brand with a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/strider-creates-adaptive-balance-bikes-for-kids-of-all-shapes-and-sizes/\">range of toddler and kid-friendly rides</a>.
