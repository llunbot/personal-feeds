As it does every year, Prime Day offers shoppers a huge selection of deals across Amazon's storefront, and there are already many deals you can get on sale ahead of the event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/primeday2020_feature3.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor our coverage, we're focusing entirely on early discounts for Apple and Apple-related products that can be purchased right now on Amazon. As of today, this includes deals on AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, MacBook Air, and more. We're also sharing deals being matched at retailers like Best Buy in some cases.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs is typical for Prime Day deals, these markdowns are very time sensitive, so sales listed below may disappear fast, and new ones may appear even faster. With this in mind, we'll keep this article updated over the next few days, and keep an eye on the MacRumors front page as we'll be posting particularly great deals in separate articles next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, Amazon Prime Day requires you to have an <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime\"><strong>Amazon Prime membership</strong></a> to take advantage of the discounts.
