The rim has been in production for sometime, being the very same 6069-T6 alloy rim in use on the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hunt-enduro-wide-v2-wheelset-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Hunt Enduro Wide V2 wheelset</a> we tested previously. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hunt has repurposed it here for the rigors of eMTB riding with triple-butted Pillar spokes and Hunt’s eMTB-specific freehub system offering 8 degree engagement. The set is yours for £479 ($649 USD). We have the key details.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hunt-e_all-mountain-emtb-wheelset-alloy-rims-31mm-width-phase-engage-hub.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hunt-e_all-mountain-emtb-wheelset-alloy-rims-31mm-width-phase-engage-hub-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"hunt emtb wheelset e_all-mountain alloy extruded rim\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hunt-e_all-mountain-emtb-wheelset-alloy-rims-31mm-width-phase-engage-hub-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hunt-e_all-mountain-emtb-wheelset-alloy-rims-31mm-width-phase-engage-hub-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hunt-e_all-mountain-emtb-wheelset-alloy-rims-31mm-width-phase-engage-hub-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hunt-e_all-mountain-emtb-wheelset-alloy-rims-31mm-width-phase-engage-hub-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hunt-e_all-mountain-emtb-wheelset-alloy-rims-31mm-width-phase-engage-hub-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hunt-e_all-mountain-emtb-wheelset-alloy-rims-31mm-width-phase-engage-hub-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hunt-e_all-mountain-emtb-wheelset-alloy-rims-31mm-width-phase-engage-hub.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>The maximum system weight on the new Hunt E_All-Mountain wheelset is 135 kg</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hunt All-Mountain eBike Wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Available in Boost only, the Hunt E_All-Mountain Wheelsets are available in 29″, 27.5″, or MX.

It pertains to a single-wall impact test scenario, said to best replicate impacts on the trail. And, it suggests the Hunt rim is more impact resistant than the rims of the Crankbrothers Synthesis eMTB Alloy wheelset, and the DT Swiss HX 1700 Spline Hybrid wheelset. More force is required to deform or break the rim.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hunt-E-All-Mountain-rim-profile.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hunt-E-All-Mountain-rim-profile-800x335.jpg\" alt=\"hunt e_all-mtn 6069 t6 alloy rim profile 31mm internal width hooked\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hunt-E-All-Mountain-rim-profile-800x335.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hunt-E-All-Mountain-rim-profile-297x124.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hunt-E-All-Mountain-rim-profile-120x50.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hunt-E-All-Mountain-rim-profile-768x322.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hunt-E-All-Mountain-rim-profile-1536x643.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hunt-E-All-Mountain-rim-profile.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>The Hunt E_All-Mountain wheelset features an internally reinforced rim for improved impact resistance.
