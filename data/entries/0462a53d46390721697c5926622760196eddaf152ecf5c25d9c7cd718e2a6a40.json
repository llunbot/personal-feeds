Such a cost is nearly twice the funding it took to build the largest structure in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which is seven times taller.</p>\n<p>This is a remarkable explosion in costs as, only five years ago, NASA awarded a contract to the Bechtel engineering firm to build and deliver a second mobile launcher (ML-2) for $383 million, with a due date of March 2023. That deadline came and went with Bechtel barely beginning to cut metal.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045558#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045558&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0462a53d46390721697c5926622760196eddaf152ecf5c25d9c7cd718e2a6a40","category":"Tech"}
