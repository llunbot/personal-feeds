The Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART mission, will seek to demonstrate the capability to change an asteroid's orbit next year.</p>\n<p>Powered by ion thrusters, the 700-kg spacecraft aims to rendezvous with a double asteroid next October. Once there, the spacecraft will attempt to collide with Dimorphos, a small \"moonlet\" of a larger asteroid named Didymos. DART will strike Dimorphos at a rate a little greater than 6.6 km/s, aiming to slightly alter the trajectory of the asteroid, which measures approximately 170 meters across.</p>\n\n<p>If NASA successfully completes this test, it will have demonstrated the capability to, one day, deflect an incoming asteroid on a collision course with Earth. \"We're trying to show that we can mitigate a threat like this,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's chief of science, in an interview with Ars.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815277#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815277&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"64d4bf311d994f879f83890ca41ee9b3c2f4b5e126c695eb35920767428171e1","category":"Tech"}
