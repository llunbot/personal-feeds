The NYT's allegedly deceptive prompts—such as repeatedly asking ChatGPT, \"what's the next sentence?\"—targeted \"two uncommon and unintended phenomena\" from both its developer tools and ChatGPT: training data regurgitation and model hallucination. OpenAI considers both \"a bug\" that the company says it intends to fix. OpenAI claimed no ordinary user would use ChatGPT this way.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009620#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009620&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6d2244fd49035ebecb45610d01c4a62ed55af9f184365799153132c1a1b7138e","category":"Tech"}
