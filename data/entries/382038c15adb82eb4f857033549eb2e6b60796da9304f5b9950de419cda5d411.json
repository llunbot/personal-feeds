Google's self-branded podcasting service <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/14151168\">shuts down tomorrow</a>, April 2, and existing users have until July to export any subscriptions that are still on the service. Google originally announced the shutdown in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/this-weeks-dead-google-products-google-podcasts-basic-gmail-and-more/\">September</a> and has been plastering shutdown notices all over the Google Podcasts site and app for a few days now.</p>\n<p>Google Podcasts was Google's third podcasting service, after Google Listen (2009–2012) and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/02/google-play-music-podcasts-are-live-for-some-users/\">Google Play Music Podcasts</a> (2016–2020). The shutdown will clear the deck for Google's media consolidation under the YouTube brand with podcasting app No. 4: YouTube Podcasts.</p>\n<p>Google Podcasts has always had an awkward life.  Despite an eight-year existence, it has only been a viable podcasting app for maybe half that time. The project grew out of the Google Search team's desire to index podcast content. That started in 2016 when searching for a podcast would <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/listen-to-podcasts-in-google-app-on/\">show a player</a> embedded right in the Google Search results. This only worked on google.com and on the Android search app.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014008#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014008&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"382038c15adb82eb4f857033549eb2e6b60796da9304f5b9950de419cda5d411","category":"Tech"}
