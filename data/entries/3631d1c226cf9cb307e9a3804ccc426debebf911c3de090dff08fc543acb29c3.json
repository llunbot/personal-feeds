As part of its push for more open payment systems, though (and to dodge each platform's 30 percent fee), Epic boldly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/epic-gives-fortnite-players-discounts-for-skirting-apple-google-fees/\">pushed out updates</a> to the Android and iOS apps that switched the payment processing from the platforms' in-app purchases to Epic's in-house system. Google and Apple both allege this action was a breach of their app store contracts with Epic.<p></p>\n<p>Apple sued and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/injunction-apple-must-open-up-app-store-payments-in-90-days/\">got its ruling</a> last month. Epic was ordered to pay $3.65 million in damages, covering Apple's lost revenue from Epic's three months of self-powered payments. Following that ruling, Google wants its missing money, too, and now it's countersuing Epic, hoping for a similar ruling.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803846#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803846&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3631d1c226cf9cb307e9a3804ccc426debebf911c3de090dff08fc543acb29c3","category":"Tech"}
