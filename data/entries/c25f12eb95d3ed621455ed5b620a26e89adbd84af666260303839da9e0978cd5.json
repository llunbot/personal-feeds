Funnily enough, that's the same year that Apple could begin building its own custom modem into cellular MacBook models, as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/macbook-integrated-cellular-modem-2028/\">previously reported</a> by Gurman. However, in his latest report, Gurman did not mention Macs in the same sentence as modems.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has explored the possibility of developing MacBooks with cellular connectivity in the past. Indeed, the company reportedly considered launching a MacBook Air with 3G connectivity, but former CEO Steve Jobs said in 2008 that Apple decided against it, since it would take up too much room in the case. An integrated SoC would solve that problem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple debuted its first custom modem, the C1, in the new iPhone 16e, which the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/\">unveiled last week</a>. According to Apple, the C1 is the most power efficient modem that's been included in an iPhone to date. The ‌iPhone 16e‌ has the longest battery life of an ‌iPhone‌ with a 6.1-inch form factor, and it lasts for up to 26 hours when watching video. Apple says the C1 is \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/apple-says-c1-modem-is-just-the-start/\">just the start</a>.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman said that Apple is already testing the so-called C2 modem as well as its successor, the C3, which is expected to arrive in 2027, by which time Apple hopes it will \"outdo Qualcomm's modem capabilities.\" <em>MacRumors</em> has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/apple-already-testing-a-c2-modem/\">previously reported</a> that Apple is testing a C2 modem, which is said to be debuting in Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models next year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/apple-c2-modem-iphone-18-pro-feature/\">according to Gurman</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has reportedly been working on its own modem since 2018, as it seeks to move away from Qualcomm's component currently used in iPhones. Apple's transition away from Qualcomm modems is a logical step, given their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/\">turbulent history</a>. Despite recent tensions, the two companies recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-extends-qualcomm-modem-licensing-deal/\">extended their modem supply agreement</a> through March 2027, allowing Apple ample time to perfect its own solution.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/c1/\">C1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/apple-integrate-future-modems-main-processor/\">Apple Aims to Eventually Integrate Future Modems into Main Processor</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-aims-to-eventually-integrate-future-modems-into-main-processor.2450067/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c25f12eb95d3ed621455ed5b620a26e89adbd84af666260303839da9e0978cd5","category":"Apple"}
