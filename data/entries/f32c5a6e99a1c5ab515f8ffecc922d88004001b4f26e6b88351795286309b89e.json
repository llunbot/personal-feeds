You didn't need to customize it, change its settings, or bolt on a bunch of extensions to make it work and feel right; <a href=\"https://mimestream.com\">Mimestream</a> was both deeply hooked into Gmail and very much a Mac app.</p>\n<p>Mimestream spent more than three years in a free beta period, releasing more than 220 updates for 167,000 users and adding more than 100 features. Now that a 1.0 release is out—and the company has grown from a solo developer to a five-person team—there's a <a href=\"https://mimestream.com/pricing/\">price for the product</a>.</p>\n<p>Mimestream is $30 per year if you buy during this launch period, then $50 per year after that (if you were a beta user, check your inbox for a bigger discount code). There's still a 14-day, no-credit-card-required trial period. Individual users can install it on up to five devices, and there's Family Sharing across iCloud accounts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941035#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941035&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f32c5a6e99a1c5ab515f8ffecc922d88004001b4f26e6b88351795286309b89e","category":"Tech"}
