To celebrate, current license holder Exient (who acquired the property from Sony) is producing a documentary titled <em>Lemmings 30th: Can You Dig It?,</em> which follows the series from its European PC origins to its current mobile iterations.\n<p>Even though it has been ported to a seemingly infinite number of consoles in the US, <em>Lemmings</em> is deeply British. It’s a game about guiding blue-robed, green-haired critters to an exit before they accidentally kill themselves along the way.</p>\n<p>The game's dry humor and puzzle design eschewed the typical '90s American-style action/arcade platforming for something less reflex-intensive, helping <em>Lemmings</em> become a hometown favorite. “If you visit Dundee, where <em>Lemmings</em> was originally created for the Amiga by DMA Design, there’s even a park with three little monuments to the <em>Lemmings</em> characters,” Exient Creative Marketing Manager Jamie Wotton told Ars. “Quite clearly—and hopefully the documentary will show this—the franchise has a special place in British culture.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789718#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789718&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Matt Paprocki","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"babb8df1868fc6d7f78eb637854d9817cfa91245eb74f49d64f2ec2bb534f00a","category":"Tech"}
