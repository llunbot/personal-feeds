Along the way he met some extraordinary characters, made extraordinary connections and undertook some extraordinary feats, from sleeping in toilets to riding through deserts to living out of dustbins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an incredible tale, and one we know you’ll love too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview begins at 5.26 </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.weareallinthistogethermovie.com/\" target=\"_blank\">We Are All In This Together</a></em> is available to stream now on Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video and Google Play.
