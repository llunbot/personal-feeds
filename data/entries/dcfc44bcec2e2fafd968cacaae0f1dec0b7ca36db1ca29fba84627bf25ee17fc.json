{"title":"★ The Best Leather Cases for iPhone 15 Pro","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/best_leather_cases_for_iphone_15_pro","date":1698670401000,"content":"\n<p>Stephen Robles tested 11 leather cases for the iPhone 15 Pro, and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6WNnw9Swhyc?si=ydQemaV8V6iubGZN\">put together a nice video review</a>. If you’re in the market for a leather iPhone case for your new iPhone 15, you should definitely watch his video.</p>\n\n<p>For the last three or four years now, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/the_case_of_the_iphone_case_poll\">I’ve been buying</a> leather iPhone cases from <a href=\"https://bullstrap.co/products/magsafe-iphone-cases-sienna?variant=43515355300034\">Bullstrap</a>. They’re expensive — $89 — but they check every box for me:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>High-quality leather. Feels good, smells good, ages well.</li>\n<li>A cut-out bottom lip. This design used to be common, but is getting harder and harder to find on <em>any</em> iPhone cases. I presume that’s because people prefer cases with a lip that goes around the entire circumference of the front face of the phone, “for protection”, but the additional protection of covering the bottom lip seems negligible to me. I strongly prefer the way a no-bottom-lip case feels when swiping up from the bottom of the phone — an action I perform dozens of times a day. This design also solves <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iphone+15+case+usb-c+cable+doesn't+fit\">any problems</a> regarding USB-C or Thunderbolt cables fitting while your iPhone in encased.</li>\n<li>Good buttons. Not great buttons, but good. This includes a button, not a cutout, for the Action button.</li>\n<li>A unique (well, sort of — see below) “gentle hump” design around the camera cutout. I think this looks good, and it <em>feels</em> great. I don’t like a sharp plastic ring around the camera cutout.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Robles ranked the Bullstrap highly, but behind <a href=\"https://ryanlondon.com/collections/leather-iphone-cases/products/leather-iphone-15-pro-max-shell-case-magsafe-saddle-brown?variant=46641687822656\">the case from Ryan London</a>. I don’t know what the deal is between these two companies, but their cases are nearly identical. Same shape (no bottom lip), same buttons, same gentle hump around the camera cutout. I suspect both companies use the same manufacturer in China. Robles prefers the Ryan London because he prefers the way their leather both looks and feels. It definitely looks like a slightly different texture. Also, the Ryan London cases are a bit cheaper: $59 (with an optional $8 add-on to personalize your case with some embossed text).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Previously:</strong> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/the_case_of_the_iphone_case_poll\">My reader poll from April</a> regarding case usage amongst DF reader. I posted <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/04/bullstrap-case-before-after.jpeg\">this photo comparing a year-old Bullstrap case next to my then-brand-new one</a> for last year’s iPhone 14.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Postscript</strong>: I actually like Apple’s FineWoven cases. I spent a week vacationing in Florida with my iPhone 15 Pro in one. (I go caseless most of the time, but like using a case while traveling, when I’m more likely to be taking a lot of pictures with my phone. An encased iPhone feels more like a camera to me, with better grippiness.) The dealbreaker for me is not the FineWoven material, which I actually kind of like. Rather, it’s the bottom lip. If Apple’s FineWoven cases had a cutout along the bottom, that would probably be the only case I’d use.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dcfc44bcec2e2fafd968cacaae0f1dec0b7ca36db1ca29fba84627bf25ee17fc","category":"Tech"}
