These speeds are part of the USB4 Version 2.0 spec—named with the USB-IF's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/usb-if-is-once-again-trying-to-logo-its-way-out-of-usb-c-confusion/\">typical flair</a> for clarity and consistency—that was published <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/usb-c-can-hit-120gbps-with-newly-published-usb4-version-2-0-spec/\">in 2022</a>. Full 80Gbps speeds are still rare and will be for the foreseeable future, but Microsoft says that they'll be included in the Razer Blade 18 and a handful of other PCs with Intel's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/intel-freshens-up-its-old-laptop-and-desktop-cpus-with-speed-bumps-new-names/\">14th-generation HX-series laptop processors</a>. We'd expect the new speeds to proliferate slowly and mostly in high-end systems over the next few months and years.</p>\n\n<p>Another addition to <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/01/11/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23615-dev-channel/\">that January 11 Dev Channel build</a> is a change in how the Copilot generative AI assistant works. Normally, Copilot is launched by the user manually, either by clicking the icon on the taskbar, hitting the Win+C key combo, or (in some new PCs) by using the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/ai-comes-for-your-pcs-keyboard-as-microsoft-adds-dedicated-copilot-key/\">dedicated Copilot button on the keyboard</a>. In recent Dev Channel builds, the Copilot window will open automatically on certain PCs as soon as you log in to Windows, becoming part of your default desktop unless you turn it off in Settings.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997547#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997547&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e06f505ab2e543dfb5e22d49fea429a3ac0f7513a6055d109b9bab4cd3a5c8a5","category":"Tech"}
