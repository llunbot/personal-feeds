Combined with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>'s deep integration with Mail and the virtual assistant's ability to create replies on the fly at the user's request, Smart Replies are being developed to streamline communication and save time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAssociated with the new Mail features is a new system-wide writing tools framework that could enable text editing via ‌Siri‌. The framework is apparently included in pre-release versions of ‌iOS 18‌, iPadOS 18, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/\">macOS 15</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlthough little is known about its implementation, the report claims that it could help change the style or tone of the user's text as they type an email or message. If a user wanted to sound less casual, for example, they could ask ‌Siri‌ to \"Make this text more professional.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report offers a number of other tidbits related to \"Project BlackPearl\" – Apple's codename for some cross-system AI and machine learning enhancements – including automatic email categorization based on content (e.g. time sensitivity), ability to summarize emails and email threads, as well as notification summaries based on topic.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBloomberg's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> has previously touched on many of the other rumored new AI features mentioned in the report that are coming to ‌iOS 18‌ and ‌macOS 15‌.
