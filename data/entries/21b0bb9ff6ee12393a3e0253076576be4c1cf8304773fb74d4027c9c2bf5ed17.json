A “multi-density” chamois gives a foundation focused on all-day comfort. Other specific design points include raw-edge bib suspenders to decrease chafe, silicone-printed grippers on the thighs, and perforated venting on the lower back. A drop-tail design improves “nature break convenience” for women. And PEARL iZUMi states the shorts are made from recycled materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl4-800x400.jpg\" alt=\"pearl izumi bibs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl4-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl4-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl4-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl4-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl4.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Attack Air Bib Shorts in men’s (left) and women’s (right).</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The women’s line comes with an option for colorful, floral-patterned suspenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterned options also exist for men’s and women’s Attack Air Jerseys — marbled “Nightshade Carrara” for women and brash “Fuego Depth” for men. (The men also get “Horizons/Alpenglow,” but it’s only available in XL and XXL as of this writing.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl3-800x400.jpg\" alt=\"pearl jerseys\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl3-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl3-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl3-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl3-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl3.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Attack Air Jerseys in men’s (left) and women’s (right) designs.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The jersey gets “infrared fabric technology,” which PEARL iZUMi says cuts the sun’s rays by imbuing dark colors with reflective and cooling properties. They’re made from up to 80% recycled materials, the company claimed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, the Quest Barrier Convertible Jacket now comes in one new patterned color each: loud “Sunfire Prime” for men and springy “Brazen Lilac Grow” for women.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl2-800x400.jpg\" alt=\"quest barrier jackets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl2-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl2-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl2-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pearl2.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Quest Barrier Convertible Jackets in men’s (left) and women’s (right).</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The article converts from a jacket to a vest, for when spring rains come and go during a ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snap-on sleeves stash in the zippered rear pocket, and a durable water repellent (DWR) finish “sheds light rain” for “emergency” <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-raincoats/\" target=\"_blank\">rain protection</a>, PEARL iZUMi says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.pearlizumi.com/products/womens-attack-air-jersey-11222301?variant=42471265829035\" target=\"_blank\">pearlizumi.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pearl-izumi-summer-cycling-apparel/\">PEARL iZUMi Summer Cycling Apparel is Ready to Bloom</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Sam Anderson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"21b0bb9ff6ee12393a3e0253076576be4c1cf8304773fb74d4027c9c2bf5ed17","category":"Cycling"}
