This phone's claim to fame is having <em>two</em> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/03/new-huawei-phone-has-a-5x-optical-zoom-thanks-to-a-periscope-lens/\">periscope camera</a> lenses on the back. Like most Oppo phones, this will land in China first, probably Europe later, and won't come to the US.</p>\n<p>The X7 Ultra is all about photography, with four 50 MP sensors on the back. Periscope camera No. 1 is a 50 MP 3x telephoto that uses a 1/1.56-inch Sony IMX890 sensor. Oppo says \"this sensor is roughly three times larger than the equivalent cameras in key competitor systems, and is the biggest telephoto sensor in any smartphone.\" Periscope No. 2 is a 6x telephoto with a 50 MP, 1/2.51-inch Sony IMX858 sensor—so more zoom, but less image quality. The main camera is Sony's top-of-the-line LYT-900 1-inch sensor, and the wide-angle is a 50 MP Sony LYT-600 sensor.</p>\n<p>Packing all these large cameras onto the back results in a big camera bump. Despite the phone being a normal-sized 6.8-inch device, the camera takes up about a third of the back, and it almost looks like you'll be touching it when you're naturally holding the phone.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994339#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994339&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"17cdb4f23a7c270e5e77f8643770b19cac5150a8e44e3b32fe56b875f1f4f06d","category":"Tech"}
