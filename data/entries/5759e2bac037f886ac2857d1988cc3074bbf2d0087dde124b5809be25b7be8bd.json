It affected 247 million individuals and was responsible for <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria#:~:text=cases%20in%202020.-,The%20estimated%20number%20of%20malaria%20deaths%20stood%20at%20619%20000,63%20000%20more%20malaria%20deaths.\">over 600,000 deaths</a> in 2022, according to the World Health Organization. What’s more shocking is that 95 percent of malaria cases and deaths are reported in Africa alone, and <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/malaria-africa-why-most-countries-havent-beaten-it-yet\">80 percent</a> of the people who die in various African countries due to malaria are children under 5.</p>\n<p>Currently, there exists only one malaria vaccine called <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/who-recommends-malaria-vaccine-for-use-in-children/\">RTS,S</a>, and it only <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/04/malaria-vaccine-rollout-is-a-gamble-an-imperfect-tool-used-imperfectly/\">offers partial protection</a> in children. However, a newly developed vaccine elicits a much stronger immune response in children, and it could offer layered protection to everyone by targeting a different stage of the malarial parasite’s life cycle.</p>\n<h2>The RH5 vaccine</h2>\n<p>A team of researchers from the University of Oxford recently tested a new malaria vaccine on 63 participants ranging in age from 6 months to 35 years in Bagamoyo, a town in Tanzania. The vaccine is technically ChAd63-MVA RH5, but generally called the RH5 vaccine. It exclusively targets RH5, a protein that <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (malaria parasite) employs to penetrate human red blood cells.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961792#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961792&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5759e2bac037f886ac2857d1988cc3074bbf2d0087dde124b5809be25b7be8bd","category":"Tech"}
