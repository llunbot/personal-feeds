Wearing the iconic turtleneck style of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, Sajid chatted fondly with Cook about his prized possession and posed for pictures while the store employees and crowd cheered.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"I am a designer myself, I was a print designer and moved to UI/UX, so I do digital design now,\" Sajid told <em><a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/europe/?url=https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/apple-ceo-tim-cook-meets-loyalist-who-carried-macintosh-to-bkc-store-launch-10431381.html\">Moneycontrol</a></em>. \"I am very happy and proud that Apple is opening a store here finally. It is a big moment for Apple users in India and we can look forward to coming to this store and exploring all the latest Apple products.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Macintosh SE was released by Apple in March 1987, and was introduced at the same time as the Macintosh II. The Macintosh SE was replaced in 1990 with the Macintosh Classic, a similar model which retained the same central processing unit and form factor, but was offered at a lower price point. Eight years later, Steve Jobs asked Cook to join Apple, where his first position was senior vice president for worldwide operations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WATCH?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WATCH</a> | Apple CEO Tim Cook surprised at seeing a customer bring his old Macintosh Classic machine at the opening of India's first Apple store at Mumbai's BKC <a href=\"https://t.co/MOY1PDk5Ug\">pic.twitter.com/MOY1PDk5Ug</a></p>â€” ANI (@ANI) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1648236613754060800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 18, 2023</a></blockquote>  </div>\r<br />\nApple's sales in India hit a new high of almost $6 billion in the year through March 2023.
