There, you can now set an app like Google Maps or Waze as your default navigation app on the iPhone by opening the Settings app and tapping Apps → Default Apps → Navigation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple made this change <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/ios-18-4-default-maps-translate-apps-in-eu/\">in response to the EU's Digital Markets Act</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple, we would love to see this option made available worldwide.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has at least made a small concession for U.S. users, allowing them to set a default translation app on iOS 18.4. For example, you can set Google Translate as your iPhone's default translation app, instead of Apple Translate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18.4 is currently in beta testing. The update will be released to the general public in early April, according to Apple's website.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/ios-18-4-new-setting/\">iOS 18.4 Adds a Highly-Requested Setting to iPhones — But Not in U.S.</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-adds-a-highly-requested-setting-to-iphones-—-but-not-in-u-s.2452941/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"25b969f4b627dd8a353221357f6cfc86bf80128ba7058195d9c1c91fd9473328","category":"Apple"}
