Designed for results and repeatability, this foundational fitness routine is one that users can return to, adjusting weights as they grow stronger.</blockquote>Alongside strength training, Apple has also introduced a new pickleball program designed to improve strength, endurance, and agility, as well as new workshop-style sessions called Yoga Peak Poses, which spotlight a single pose to help users build confidence and skill. There's also a new Introduction to Breath Meditation program.
