Until, that is, I agreed to attempt the Dirty Reiver.</span></p>\n<p><span>For those not in the know, the Dirty Reiver is a timed gravel event that covers 65, 130 or 200km of the Kielder Forest, which spans the border region of England and Scotland.</span></p>\n<p><span>Just how different could it be? And what, after three decades of racing mountain bikes, could I learn from 130km (no, I didn’t do the full 200km) of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/gravel-racing/\">gravel racing</a>?</span></p>\n<h2>Group gravel riding can be downright scary</h2>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" title=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Dirty Reiver has grown into one of the UK’s most popular gravel races.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>It’s one thing to rip along the road in a tightly packed group with your mates, but riding in a bunch on a slippery, unpredictable surface at speed with a bunch of strangers is, at times, terrifying.</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s a very different experience to racing cross-country on a mountain bike, where the riders quickly get thinned out as you enter the first section of singletrack. Sure, XC delivers a bit of bar-to-bar bumping, but as the race wears on, you generally end up riding with far fewer people.</span></p>\n<p><span>A gravel event, it seems, is more like the start of the Mega Avalanche, except your brakes aren’t as good, and you’re wearing far less protection, despite clocking higher speeds – and it seems to last for longer. </span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" title=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I’ve been mountain biking for 30 years, but riding a gravel race saw me break new ground.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>At an event of this size, with this number of people, even when I did lose contact with one group, I soon found myself riding with another.</span></p>\n<p><span>While gravel has some similarities with mountain biking, when it comes to rides such as this, the road influence really comes to the fore, especially when riding in a big bunch.</span></p>\n<p><span>With mud, gravel and slippery embedded rock under your tyres, you find your face being pummelled with dirt from the rear tyre of the rider in front (it was very wet during this year’s edition). </span></p>\n<p><span>There’s also a chance you’ll smack a pothole/massive rock/someone’s bottle/a loose saddle pack and be sent careering off into the undergrowth, puncturing the lightweight tyres that, let’s be honest, have the weight of the world resting on their thin, flimsy, shoulders.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" title=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> All clean… for now.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Concentration is key here, too. While it’s easy to slip into a hypnotic state watching the rear wheel of the rider in front, you need to keep your head and eyes on a swivel. </span></p>\n<p><span>And, if that rider points to something on the trail or road, be warned, they aren’t pointing at a badger doing sudoku (sadly) or anything as exciting as that. This is in fact a warning that something needs avoiding.</span></p>\n<h2>Find your Guardians of the Gravelty</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" title=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Riding in a group on gravel can be daunting, but find your Guardians of the Gravelty and you’ll be flying.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>I ride 100km on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bike</a> maybe only a handful of times each year. </span></p>\n<p><span>Instead, I spend most of my time riding a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike/\">mountain bike</a> with heavy tyres, and a lot of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">suspension travel</a>, up a steep hillside so I can ride back down as fast as possible.

However, find a good bunch of well-paced, sensible individuals and before you know it, you’ll be at the final feed zone with mud in your eyes, a smile on your face and enough energy to keep trucking on for the final few kilometres. Thanks guys!</span></p>\n<h2>Wear all the layers</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" title=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Kielder Forest is as bleak as it is beautiful.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>While road and </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\"><span>gravel riding</span></a><span> are physically exhausting, it’s a different kind of workout for your body.</span></p>\n<p><span>My main takeaway from riding the Dirty Reiver on a cold, damp day was you need to wear far more layers than you might do on a mountain bike.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" title=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The face of a man who’s had a long, dirty day out on the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Why? Well, quite simply put, your upper body doesn’t really do a whole lot of moving around while you ride. </span></p>\n<p><span>On a mountain bike, you tend to stand up out of the saddle and use your arms a lot more to absorb bumps or throw the bike around.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" title=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tough conditions made this a particularly testing edition of the Dirty Reiver.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>This isn’t generally the case on a gravel bike. I ended up wearing a baselayer, Windstopper jersey, fleece-lined gilet and Windstopper jacket for the full 130km ride.</span></p>\n<p><span>In similar conditions on a mountain bike, I’d probably wear a baselayer and Windstopper jersey, only pulling out a jacket if the weather really turned.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" title=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A positive attitude on a wet and wild day.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>At about the halfway point, around 2 hours 30 minutes in, the wind got up and it rained quite heavily. To say I was pleased with my over-the-top choice of layers would be an understatement. </span></p>\n<p><span>While others shivered, I continued to stay warm and dry. And maybe a little bit smug, too.</span></p>\n<h2>Eat everything you can carry and then some</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" title=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Now I know why gravel riders carry all of those bags.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>This will sound obvious – but eat as much food as possible if you’re heading out on a long ride.</span></p>\n<p><span>Having ridden the same sort of distance before, albeit on a road bike, I figured the couple of energy bars I had should suffice and get me round just fine. This was not the case.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dirty Reiver 2023\" title=\"Dirty Reiver 2023_-20\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A long paceline of gravel riders skirts the dam wall.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>It turns out that, like mountain biking, covering that distance when you’re rattling over rocks, grit, gravel and mud takes more energy. It’s fair to say I underestimated this and should have approached it more like a big day out on the mountain bike.</span></p>\n<p><span>Bars, bananas, sandwiches and whatever else you can attach to yourself or your bike (now I can see why people who do this regularly have so many bags on their bikes) will all be eaten, so carry whatever you can.
