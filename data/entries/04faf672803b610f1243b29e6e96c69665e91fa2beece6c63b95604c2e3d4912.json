The browser aims to help users manage stress and maintain focus while navigating the internet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/opera-air1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"7680\" height=\"4320\" />\r<br />\nThe Norwegian browser maker has incorporated several science-backed wellness tools into Opera Air, including breathing exercises, meditation sessions, and binaural beats. Users can access these features through two main functions: \"Take a Break\" and \"Boosts.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe \"Take a Break\" feature offers guided exercises ranging from 3 to 15 minutes, including breathing exercises, meditation, and full body scans. Users can set reminders to take mindful breaks throughout their browsing sessions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/opera-air3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"7680\" height=\"4320\" />\r<br />\nOpera Air's \"Boosts\" feature takes advantage of binaural beats technology, which plays slightly different frequencies in each ear to influence brainwave activity. Users can choose from various preset options like \"Creativity Boost,\" \"Energized Focus,\" and \"Deep Relaxation.\" The feature also allows customization of volume levels, nature sounds, and background music, with sessions lasting from 15 minutes to unlimited duration.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOpera says the browser is designed to maintain its core functionality while introducing these wellness features in a non-disruptive way. Users can continue browsing or working while using features like the \"Focused Calm\" boost, which uses Alpha 8Hz beats combined with nature sounds to promote concentration.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nTo aid the sense of a calmer browsing environment, Opera Air also features a minimalist Scandinavian design with a frosted glass user interface. Opera Air is available to download today from the <a href=\"https://www.opera.com/air\">company's website</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/opera-browser/\">Opera Browser</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/04/opera-air-brings-meditation-wellness-web-browsing/\">Opera Air Brings Meditation and Wellness to Web Browsing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/opera-air-brings-meditation-and-wellness-to-web-browsing.2448742/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"04faf672803b610f1243b29e6e96c69665e91fa2beece6c63b95604c2e3d4912","category":"Apple"}
