{"title":"The Comma That Might Cost Apple Billions in Europe","link":"https://cafetechinenglish.substack.com/p/a-simple-comma-will-cost-apple-billion?r=6gzkf&triedRedirect=true","date":1749168564000,"content":"\n<p>Jérôme Marin, writing at Cafétech:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The disagreement between Apple and Brussels centers on Article\n5.4. In its English version, the article states that the\ngatekeeper — the term used by the Commission for the seven major\ntech companies subject to the DMA — <em>“shall allow business users,\nfree of charge, to communicate and promote offers, including under\ndifferent conditions […], and to conclude contracts with those end\nusers.”</em></p>\n\n<p>This lengthy sentence creates ambiguity: what exactly does <em>“free\nof charge”</em> apply to? Apple claims it only applies to\n<em>“communicate”</em> and <em>“promote,”</em> meaning the right to insert\nredirect links in an app. But not to <em>“conclude contracts,”</em>\nmeaning making purchases. Based on that, Apple argues it can still\ncharge commissions on those external transactions.</p>\n\n<p>The European Commission interprets it differently: contract\nconclusion must also be free of charge. It relies on the comma\nbefore the phrase <em>“and to conclude contracts,”</em> turning the\nsentence into an <em>“enumeration.” “That ‘free of charge’ applies to\nall that is being enumerated after”,</em> it explains in <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202522/DMA_100109_906.pdf\">its detailed\ndecision sent to Apple</a> as part of the €500 million fine,\nwhich was made public last week.</p>\n\n<p><em>“In other words, the price for app developers to pay [for\nexternal purchases] is zero,”</em> writes the Commission. However, its\ncase could be weakened by inconsistencies in the French and German\ntranslations of the text, which it acknowledges are <em>“ambiguous.”</em>\nStill, <em>“other linguistic versions leave no room for\ninterpretation,”</em> notes Brussels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand why EU laws are published in multiple languages, but it’s wild that that can create possible loopholes like this. But it seems rather obvious what the EC’s intention was here, and it wasn’t for Apple to charge commissions — let alone steep commissions — on transactions that take place outside the app after users tap a link to the web. If I were one of Apple’s lawyers, I’d argue about the placement of a comma too, and what it implies about what “free of charge” applies to. But the EC’s intentions are obvious. It’s not really about a comma.</p>\n\n<p>On this particular issue Apple seems to be facing the exact same pushback in the EU <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/05/apple-appeal-denied-antisteering\">as in the US</a>: their anti-steering rules in the App Store aren’t legal.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/05/the-comma-that-might-cost-apple-billions-in-europe\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"267e352febd97ff27732350a0b7e80973e2d4c662da2910278a852655a0a0178","category":"Tech"}
