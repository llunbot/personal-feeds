The talks were exploratory and never \nreached an advanced stage, they said. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This sounds like more of a “<em>we talked to everyone so of course we talked to Apple</em>” thing than an “<em>Apple came close to doing this</em>” thing.</p>\n\n<p>The problem, I think, isn’t about whether Apple could make users happy running its own default search engine. It’s whether Apple could generate the profit it gets from Google for serving as the default now. It’s an enormous pile of money.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/02/msft-bing-apple\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7e7dc067000c80a6cd34861bfa00b84fcb821717ad60611c6f686fc3b7547038","category":"Tech"}
