For newbies, they may seem like an “extra” that only serious riders need… until you find yourself on the side of the road or trail trying desperately to pry a flat tire off of a rim with your bare hands.</p><p>Tire levers allow you to quickly—and cleanly—remove your tire from your rim with significantly less effort. They save your fingers, your tire rim, and possibly, the rest of your ride.

Ultimately, we’re not kidding anyone that tire levers can vary too widely between brands. But there are a few that have stood the test of time, and handled prying off even the most reluctant of tires.

They’re designed with angled side tips that can finesse their way under the tightest of tires, with rounded edges that are unlikely to damage anything…even rim tape.</p><p>They’re also designed to fit comfortably in your hand and are slightly longer than most tire levers in order to provide more leverage. They’re also a bit thicker than others, so they’re great for big hands. We also love that they snap together so that one never goes missing in the depths of your saddlebag.</p><p>They only come in one color at the moment—red—so if you prefer a simple black set or want a wilder colorway, you’ll want to look elsewhere. But if you’re all business and just want a simple set of tire levers that will do the job, Bontrager has your back.</p><ul><li>Color: Red</li><li>Dimensions: 34 grams</li><li>Price: $5</li></ul><h3><span>&nbsp;<strong>BEST AT HOME TIRE LEVERS</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NX28H4M/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Clever Standard Clever Lever</a></span><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever.jpg\" alt=\"clever tire lever\" width=\"1600\" height=\"885\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-297x164.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-800x443.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-120x66.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-768x425.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-1536x850.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-696x385.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-1068x591.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-759x420.jpg 759w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb26 src ng ngcb26 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-297x164.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-800x443.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-120x66.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-768x425.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-1536x850.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-696x385.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-1068x591.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05155650/clever-tire-lever-759x420.jpg 759w\"></a></h3><p>Want a tire lever that does more than just pry off tight tires? Enter the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/06/02/new-clever-standard-flatout-tire-lever-fixes-your-chain/\">Clever Standard Clever Lever</a>, a weirdly fancy set of tire levers that seems gimmicky on the surface but is actually super useful.</p><p>One Bikerumor editor keeps them perched on his workstand for breaking open quick links as well as removing tight tires. The two tire levers interlock together to form a set of quick link pliers to make removing or reassembling a master chain link easy. It can also tighten or remove valve cores. And the levers themselves are designed to be non-slip so if your hands are slick with sweat, you’ll still be able to use them easily.</p><p>These levers might be a bit overbuilt, especially if you have a chain breaker on your multitool.

And yes, the “Lever” rather than “LeverS” is purposeful: You only get one.</p><p>Rather than your usual set of two, this lever comes solo, but boasts a protected handhold that protects your fingers should it slip out just as you’re giving it your all. If you know what we’re talking about, then you’ll appreciate just how ingenious this is for preventing you from punching your spokes at full speed. Think, plastic knuckles…not bloody knuckles..</p><p>The reverse side has a hook that slides over the rim to help you reseat tight tires, too. With modern tubeless tires being much easier to mount and dismount, we’d say this is best for those still running tube-type road tires, or newbies just learning to change their own tires and tubes.

Tire levers will make a flat change a lot smoother, since they help you quickly remove your tire from the rim. And they avoid getting your hands greasy or dirt-covered in the process.</p><p>They also can save your rim. If you don’t have tire levers, you may need to resort to using something that could damage your rim in your attempt to detach your tire.

Run the tire lever around the rim, guiding the tire into place on the rim and allowing the sealant to spread out.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How do you use tire levers?<br></strong>Tire levers help you to pry your tire off by sliding under the bead of the tire, then gently bringing that bead over and off of the rim of the wheel. Once you have one lever under the tire bead, you simply press it back to create space, then use the hook at the end of the lever to fasten it to a spoke.</p><p>Then, use your second lever to slide into the space created by the first lever, and work the second lever around the rim, fully detaching the tire so that you can pull out the tube and replace it. You can also reverse the process to get the tire back onto the rim of the wheel, and to carefully make sure that no bits of the tube are caught under the bead of the tire, since that can lead to a pinch flat.</p><p><span><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbLns_P0khA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></span></p><p><strong>Can you use a multitool as a tire lever?</strong><br>While you can technically most sharp, hard objects as tire levers, we highly recommend not using anything other than an actual tire lever or your bare hands. That’s because using metal (like a small Allen key or screwdriver from your multitool) could scrape or damage your tire’s rim, and potentially further puncture or stress the tube or tire. It could also puncture or scratch the rim tape, which will ruin a tubeless setup. That said, if it’s between walking your bike 10 miles home or using a multitool to pry off a tire, we’re not judging you.</p><p><strong>Can you use your hands instead of tire levers?</strong><br>Sometimes, yes, but it takes a lot of hand strength and a bit of know-how. Most tires are tight enough to the rim that they won’t come right off (and if they do, that might be part of the reason for your flat). But you can use your hands to work your way around the tire, pulling the rubber as taunt as possible by getting the beads into the center channel to allow a bit of give in a single spot, allowing you to peel the tire off the rim.</p><p><strong>Do you really need to carry two tire levers?</strong><br>Two will get the job done faster, but you can <em>usually</em> manage with just one, if you’re really tight on space or trying to save a few extra grams of weight.</p><p><strong>Why does tire lever quality matter?</strong><br>Some of the cheaper tire levers have the tendency to bend and snap (and not in a fun Legally Blonde kind of way) at the worst possible moment. And metal ones can damage or bend your rims, so we don’t recommend those. A good set of tire levers—like the ones we’ve recommended above—will usually last you a lifetime.</p></div></div>","author":"Molly Hurford","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"046ca484ed3c7282af88f3eadee67e1ce183bab5ff16c4f4c6c53a0281826c59","category":"Cycling"}
