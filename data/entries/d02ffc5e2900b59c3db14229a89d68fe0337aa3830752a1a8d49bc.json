Ahead of time, several unboxing videos of the new models have surfaced online, offering a closer real-world look at the new color.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iphone-14-yellow-boxes.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nMKBHD's Marques Brownlee provides what is probably the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a01edYZIfjc\">most comparative look</a> at the new iPhone 14 Plus in Yellow. Brownlee describes it as a \"really safe, light, pale yellow - lighter than anything I've compared it to.\"\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nTo demonstrate, Brownlee shows it next to a New York City MetroCard, a banana, and a Snapchat Pixy drone. One aspect of the device that is dark is the sides, which he calls a \"slightly closer to gold color.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor contrast, Brownlee also includes a comparison shot of the new color alongside the Yellow that Apple offered the iPhone XR in a few years ago.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iphone-14-iphone-xr-yellow-mkbhd.jpg\" alt width=\"610\" height=\"446\" /><div><em>iPhone XR on the left</em></div>\r<br />\nMeanwhile, Japanese blog <em>Mac Otakara</em> has uploaded an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4zuhWbG8Zw\">unboxing video</a> that provides a good look at how the new Yellow color appears outdoors in sunny conditions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nApple usually introduces new ‌iPhone‌ color options in the spring to boost sales midway through the device's product cycle. Apple will later today begin accepting pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in Yellow in the U.S. and more than 60 other countries and regions. As mentioned, deliveries to customers and in-store availability will begin Tuesday, March 14.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-14\">iPhone 14 (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/yellow-iphone-14-unboxing-videos/\">Yellow iPhone 14 Unboxing Videos Shared Ahead of Next Week's Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/yellow-iphone-14-unboxing-videos-shared-ahead-of-next-weeks-launch.2383309/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d02ffc5e2900b59c3db14229a89d68fe0337aa3830752a1a8d49bc","category":"Apple"}
