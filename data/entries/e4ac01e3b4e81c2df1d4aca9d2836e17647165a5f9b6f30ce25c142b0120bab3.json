During the 2010s, the UK claimed a total of six Tour de France victories. We’re still waiting for the heir to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/chris-froome\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Froome</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/geraint-thomas\" target=\"_blank\">Geraint Thomas’s</a> throne as they approach retirement in the coming seasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The groundwork has been laid for more British success though. There’s an exciting crop of young British riders breaking through the ranks across a number of teams, including Britain’s own WorldTour team of Ineos Grenadiers. In fact,<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/british-riders-tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\"> the 2024 race saw the largest amount of Brits competing</a> since the race’s inception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we search for the next British yellow jersey, we’ve found a Scotsman, a Welshman and a big emerging collective from south London who look set to take the British mantle at future Tours de France.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Oscar Onley</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/53798239374_8999c877d6_o-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/53798239374_8999c877d6_o-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/53798239374_8999c877d6_o-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/53798239374_8999c877d6_o-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/53798239374_8999c877d6_o-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/53798239374_8999c877d6_o-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/53798239374_8999c877d6_o-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/53798239374_8999c877d6_o-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/53798239374_8999c877d6_o-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/53798239374_8999c877d6_o-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/53798239374_8999c877d6_o.jpg 1600w\" /><figcaption>Rémi Dallot/Flickr</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scotland’s cycling hopes lie with Oscar Onley, a 21-year-old from Kelso in the Borders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After brewing at the DSM Development Team for a couple of seasons, Onley broke through at the 2022 Cro Race after going head to head with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Vingegaard </a>on the Croatian climbs. After that performance, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/dsm-firmenich-postnl\" target=\"_blank\">DSM-Firmenich-PostNL</a> promoted the Scot to the WorldTour level, and the youngster continued his upward trajectory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite suffering three collarbone breaks in eight months between August and April, 2024 has seen his best year to date. In the early season Tour Down Under, Onley claimed a win atop the infamous Willunga Hill. A convincing eighth place overall at the Tour de Suisse demonstrated that Onley is ready to compete with the sport’s top climbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently making his Tour de France debut, Onley has been searching for breakaway success, but to no avail so far. He has the accolade of being the first Scottish rider to compete in the Tour since 2013, and the first Scottish-<em>born </em>rider to compete in the Tour since 1991.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n

of many riders from south London on this list, Leo Hayter made the jump up to Ineos Grenadiers two years ago at the age of 20. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This early career promotion came after a spell of impressive results on the under-23 level, including a win at the youngsters’ Giro d’Italia, colloquially known as the Baby Giro, in June of 2022. At that race, Hayter fended off the likes of 2024 UAE Tour winner Lennart van Eetvelt and French <em>wunderkind </em>Lenny Martinez. Hayter also claimed a bronze medal in the under-23 individual time-trial at the World Championships later that year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since that big win in Italy, Hayter’s schedule has been sporadic. He has done very few WorldTour races and has instead been fielded to a number of one-day races. He is fast approaching his 23rd birthday and slipping behind those he beat at the 2022 Baby Giro. Ineos are yet to send him to a Grand Tour, but his big debut is sure to come soon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the surname suggests, Leo is the younger brother of Ethan Hayter, the current British National Champion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Joseph Blackmore</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"jospeh blackmore future british tour de france rider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-11-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-11-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-11-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-11.jpg 1600w\" /><figcaption>IGIHE</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Joseph Blackmore – another rider hailing from south London – was a revelation of the spring. The 21-year-old began 2024 by winning the GC standings at both the Tour of Rwanda and the Tour of Taiwan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was rewarded by the team and received some WorldTour cameos, including at the Brabantse Pijl where he finished in fourth place while on teammate duties for Dylan Teuns. Blackmore’s form continued with a win at the under-23’s Liège-Bastogne-Liège, and was soon rewarded with a promotion to Israel-Premier Tech’s senior team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blackmore is more of a Classics rider than a GC contender – and is the current Gravel National Champion – but the Englishman has the potential to evolve into a well-rounded card at Israel-Premier Tech where he is contracted until 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lukas Nerurkar</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1982860275-min-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"lukas nerurkar future british rider at the tour de france\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1982860275-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1982860275-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1982860275-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1982860275-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1982860275-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1982860275-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1982860275-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1982860275-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1982860275-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1982860275-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Luc Claessen/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lukas Nerurkar is a born-and-bred athlete.

The 22-year-old has only featured in one race (the British National Road Championships) so far. He is expected to make his return for Visma-Lease a Bike later this year at the Czech Tour. He may become a key <em>domestique</em> for Jonas Vingegaard or a future star within Visma-Lease a Bike’s ranks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Josh Tarling</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-970x647.png\" alt=\"josh tarling tour de france british\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T122158.995.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve kept the biggest, and youngest, hopeful for last in Josh Tarling. Far from a GC threat – for now – Tarling is a thoroughbred time-triallist. The Ineos rider burst through last year with a bronze medal in the time-trial at the World Championships in Stirling. He followed that up with a WorldTour win at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/worldtour-race-ranked-men\" target=\"_blank\">Renewi Tour</a> and a European Road Championship title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At just 20 years old, Tarling has become one of the most established time-triallists on the UCI WorldTour level. The Welshman has two British national titles to his name and has stated his intent to race more in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/classics\">the Classics</a> in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tarling will have to compete against his current teammate Filippo Ganna for time-trial supremacy, and with the growing amount of GC riders competent against the clock, the role of a time-trial purist is becoming more of a dying art at the Tour de France. That said, Tarling has the legs to win a Grand Tour stage or two in the coming years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a hybrid track and road rider, Tarling will target the Olympic Games this summer. This gives some hints as to why he was omitted from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a>‘ Grand Tour rosters in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ireland’s future</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2045637424-min-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"darren rafferty and archie ryan future irish riders at the tour de france\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2045637424-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2045637424-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2045637424-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2045637424-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2045637424-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2045637424-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2045637424-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2045637424-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2045637424-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2045637424-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption> Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although not British, Ireland has a group of impressive youngsters rising through the ranks at the sport’s top level. Perhaps, there is a chance that an Irish rider wins the Tour de France sooner than a British rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>County Wicklow’s Archie Ryan has improved greatly over the past few seasons, most recently at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ef-education-easypost\" target=\"_blank\">EF Education-EasyPost</a>. A product of the high-performing Jumbo-Visma Development Team, Ryan is a strong climber with a fiery kick. He claimed a stage win recently at Coppi e Bartali and finished second overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the brighter star is County Tyrone’s Darren Rafferty. The EF climber finished in second place at the Baby Giro in 2023. He also bagged an overall win at the Giro Ciclistico della Valle d’Aosta. This race is usually a breeding ground for future talent including former winners <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/thibaut-pinot\" target=\"_blank\">Thibaut Pinot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/fabio-aru\" target=\"_blank\">Fabio Aru</a> and Pavel Sivakov. Having just turned 21, Rafferty has competed at a number of WorldTour stage races this year, culminating in a top 30 overall at the top-level Critérium du Dauphiné and Tour de Romandie. No rider from the north of Ireland has ever won a Grand Tour stage, so here’s hoping that their day will come.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cat-ferguson-interview\">‘I’m just excited to race my bike for a living’: Cat Ferguson interview</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-sponsors\">Who actually are the Tour de France team sponsors 2024?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/british-riders-tour-de-france\">Lads on (Grand) Tour: The 11 British riders at the 2024 Tour de France</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2024: Route, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/future-british-tour-de-france-stars\">Who are Britain’s future Tour de France stars?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e4ac01e3b4e81c2df1d4aca9d2836e17647165a5f9b6f30ce25c142b0120bab3","category":"Cycling"}
