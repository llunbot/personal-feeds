The most valuable company in the world holds its own events, thank you very much. Several times a year, Apple invites the press and industry professionals to Apple Park to hear all about its latest products and services. Apple calls these ‘events,’ and streams them live online to millions of watchers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>UPDATE: February 17, 2025. Apple is set to launch one or more new products on Wednesday February 19. An event isn’t expected, instead the company is likely to issue a press release after taking the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672557/the-apple-store-is-down-whats-apple-launching.html\">Apple Store offline</a> that morning. Read on to find out at what time Apple is likely to make the February 19 announcement.  </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, Apple held three events: one on Tuesday, May 7, at which it launched new iPads, a keynote to kick off WWDC on June 10, where the features coming in the new operating systems iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia were revealed, and an event on September 9 at which Apple unveiled the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-price-features.html\">new iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch Series 10</a> and the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2463401/airpods-4-with-anc-review.html\">AirPods 4</a>. In October 2024 there was no event, but Apple did announce new products (iMac, Mac mini and MacBook Pro) via press release. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023 there were three such events: WWDC in June, an iPhone event in September, and Apple’s second fall event on October 30 (or after midnight on October 31 if you weren’t in the U.S.). Similarly, in 2022 Apple held three events: a spring event on March 8, WWDC on June 6, and the iPhone 14 launch on September 7. In other years Apple has held four events though and it may do so in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to find out what events and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products.html\">new Apple product launches</a> the company has in store for 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is Apple’s next event? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has revealed (on <a href=\"https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1890068457825394918\">X</a>) that it has an “#Apple Launch” planned for Wednesday February 19. 2025. This is expected to be the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/new-iphone-se-release-date-se4-16e-design-specs-features.html\">new iPhone SE</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This won’t be an event in the traditional sense – perhaps indicating that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2605372/the-era-of-the-apple-event-is-over.html\">the era of the Apple event is over</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this, we are still hopeful that Apple will hold a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">spring event in 2025</a>. If it does then, based on previous spring events, we expect that the event will be held in late March or early April, although in 2024 the spring event was in May.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What time will the next Apple event start?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple keynotes usually start at 10 am PT, but the February 19 ‘event’ is likely to be a press release rather than a keynote event. On launch days Apple usually closes the Apple Store early in the morning (depending on where you are) and then releases the news some hours later. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple usually issues such press releases around 11 a.m. ET, 8 a.m. PT, and 4 p.m. in the UK. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple holds a keynote to announce a new product it usually starts at the following times in the countries where most of our readers live:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>U.S.: at 10 am (PST/PDT), 11 am (MST/MDT), noon (CST/CDT), 1 pm (EST/EDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Canada: as above, and 2 pm (AST/ADT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>U.K.: at 6 pm (GMT/BST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Europe: at 7pm (CET/CEST), 8 pm (EET/EEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>India: at 10.30 pm (IST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Australia: Next day at 1 am (AWST/AWDT), 2.30 am (ACST/ACDT), 3 am (AEST/AEDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Zealand: Next day at 5 am (NZST/NZDT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Timings may be slightly different if Apple holds the event during the period of a couple of weeks when the clocks have changed in the U.S. but not elsewhere (that’s between March 9 and March 30). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes Apple holds events at different times, for example, in October 2023 the event was held in late afternoon in San Francisco, which meant it was midnight in the U.K. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How long does an Apple event last?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple keynotes usually last between one and two hours and feature CEO Tim Cook along with various other Apple executives. WWDC and the September event tend to be longer keynotes; the spring and late-fall events can be slightly shorter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The September 2024 event was 1 hour 38 minutes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When does Apple usually hold events?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple holds three or four live or live-streamed events throughout the year. During these events, the company unveils its latest products and plans during a keynote address. They are usually held during similar times of the year:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>March/April: Spring event (in 2024 this was held in May)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>June: WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>September: Fall event (aka iPhone and Apple Watch launch event)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>October/November: Late-fall event(s)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This event calendar is by no means set in stone, though, with the spring and October events being less regular. Some years, Apple doesn’t hold a spring event at all, as was the case in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The summer and September events are more predictable, with software coming at WWDC in June and iPhones and Apple Watches in September. The October event often sees Apple launch new Macs, but this is another one that changes from year to year.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"New Apple Products Apple Event September\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1246w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1200%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1240%2C868&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"836\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Apple launched the new iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods Pro in September 2022.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Apple events will take place in 2025?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the events we expect to see in 2025, and what could launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spring event 2025 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the dates of the past seven Apple spring events, as you can see, it’s not a regular occurrence, but a Spring event is held slightly more often than not. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2024: Tuesday May 7</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2023: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022: Tuesday March 8</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Tuesday April 20</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: Monday March 25</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Tuesday March 27</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2016: Monday March 21</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2015: Monday March 9</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2014: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2013: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2012: Wednesday March 7</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As for what could be coming, Apple looks set to update the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE</a> on February 19, so what does that leave?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are rumors that Apple could launch an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2024-release-date.html\">11th gen iPad</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with a screen</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also probable that an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">M4 MacBook Air</a> may also arrive in the spring so we could see this launch at a spring event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about Apple’s spring events read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">Apple Spring event: Date, time, product launch rumors.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WWDC keynote 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WWDC 2024 took place from June 10-14 with the Apple’s keynote kicking the conference off at 10am on June 10, 2024. Expect similar timings for 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple uses WWDC each year to unveil details of the latest versions of its operating systems, so in 2025 we’ll get a preview of iOS 19, iPadOS 19, macOS 16, watchOS 12, and tvOS 19, and an update to Apple’s realityOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple sometimes announces new hardware at WWDC, usually the high end models targeted at power users, so we could see new Macs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, we may still be waiting for the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">M4 Mac Studio</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320613/m3-m4-ultra-mac-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">M4 Ultra Mac Pro</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">M4 Pro 32-inch iMac Pro</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the keynote on the Monday, developer events and sessions will run throughout the week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dates for WWDC:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WWDC 2024: June 10-14</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2023: June 5-9</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2022: June 6-10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2021: June 7-11</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2020: June 22-26</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2019: June 3-7</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2018: June 4-8</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2017: June 5-9</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We are certain to get a preview of the new software, but what about hardware? Any of the Macs that don’t launch in October 2024 are likely to have been announced by June 2024, but if not, this is where we will see them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read more about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC date, times and everything you need to know</a> in a separate article.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>September iPhone event 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple always holds an event in September, and almost always uses this to announce a new iPhone and Apple Watch. (The only exception in recent memory was in 2020, as a result of Covid-related production issues. That year the iPhone was announced in October, but there was still a September event.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025 we expect that Apple will unveil the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17</a>, Apple Watch 11, a new Apple Watch Ultra and Apple Watch SE. We may also see the M5 arrive in the iPad Pro. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the past few Apple September event dates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2024: Monday, September 9</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2023: Tuesday, September 12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022: Tuesday, September 13</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022: Wednesday, September 7</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Tuesday, September 14</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: Tuesday, September 15</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: Tuesday, September 10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Wednesday, September 12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: Tuesday, September 12</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about Apple’s September events read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple’s September iPhone event: Date, time, and what will launch.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>October event 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There was no October event in 2024, with Apple making product announcements via press release. Despite the lack of event in 2024 though, Apple has a president of updating certain Macs in the October time frame, so this may be when we see new Macs running M5 chips. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, Apple has held a second fall event on the following dates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2024: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2023: Monday, October 30</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Monday, October 18</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: Tuesday, October 13 and Tuesday, November 10 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Tuesday, October 30</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2016: Thursday, October 27</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2015: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2014: Thursday, October 16</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2013: Tuesday, October 22</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2012: Tuesday, October 23</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2011: Tuesday, October 4</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple may update certain Macs to M5 chips at this event, including the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2552098/m5-macbook-pro-design-processor-specs-release.html\">M5 MacBook Pro</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about Apple’s October events read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1064916/apple-october-event-date-time-mac-ipad.html\">Apple’s October Event: Date, time and what will launch.</a></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"23d8060205445a439326ec4e7295c9851da895b3b932a33d7568fc894bf4a4b0","category":"Apple"}
