The prior version of the ChargeKey was limited to 60W charging speeds and USB 2.0 data transfer speeds, so the new model offers notable improvements for MacBook users and those who need a portable cable for data transfers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike the previous ChargeKey, the 240W model has a braided nylon cable with electroplated zinc cable housings. It's compact and small enough to fit on a keychain, and the two cable tips attach to one another magnetically when not in use.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNomad is selling the ChargeKey for $25, and it is <a href=\"https://nomadgoods.com/products/chargekey-v2\">available from the Nomad website</a> starting today.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nomad/\">Nomad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/nomad-240w-chargekey/\">Nomad Launches New 240W ChargeKey USB-C Cable</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nomad-launches-new-240w-chargekey-usb-c-cable.2449621/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f1f4c779182a789e50bd1a0bd754d0f662e733e7e79c2b22354d63283de20af4","category":"Apple"}
