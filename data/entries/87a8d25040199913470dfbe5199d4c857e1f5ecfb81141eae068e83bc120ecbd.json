The bottom line, he said, is that the vehicle's flight slightly exceeded his expectations and that damage to the launch site was not all that extensive. He expects Starship to fly again in as few as two or three months.</p>\n<p>\"Basically the outcome was roughly sort of what I expected and maybe slightly exceeded my expectations,\" he said. \"<span>And I'm glad to report that the pad damage is actually quite small, and it looks like it can be repaired quite quickly. It was actually just good to get this vehicle off the ground because we've made so many improvements in Booster 9 and beyond.\"</span></p>\n<p>Musk spoke for about an hour during a Twitter spaces event, responding to questions from several journalists and spaceflight enthusiasts. For those unable to listen, what follows is a summary of what Musk said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935562#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935562&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"87a8d25040199913470dfbe5199d4c857e1f5ecfb81141eae068e83bc120ecbd","category":"Tech"}
