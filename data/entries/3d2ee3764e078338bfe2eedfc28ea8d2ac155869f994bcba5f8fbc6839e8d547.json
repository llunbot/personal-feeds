But if you’re looking for a new iPad mini, there’s never been a better time to buy. Amazon is running deep discounts on some of its most popular models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G91LXFP/\"><strong>iPad mini, down to $350</strong></a>, a whopping $150 off, and the lowest price we’ve ever seen. It may be a couple of years old, but it’s still a fantastic tablet, with a super-light design built around an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, an A15 processor, and a 12MP ultra-wide front camera. Weighing about a half-pound, it’s smaller and lighter than a book, and sturdy enough to cram into any bag or backpack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLT98Q7\"><strong>10th-gen iPad, which is down to $299</strong></a>, $50 off its MSRP, and the best price we’ve ever seen. The 10th-gen iPad is Apple’s entry-level tablet, with a 10.9-inch display and an A14 processor. It’s also got Touch ID, in the power button, 64GB of storage, and a choice of several fun colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, if you really miss the Home button, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9FPHY6/\"><strong>9th-gen model with a 10.2-inch screen is down to $199</strong></a>. It’s been at this price for a while, but it’s still a great price for a very good tablet, with an A13 chip, and a 12MP Ultra Wide camera with Center Stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you need a new tablet and want the best price, beat the Black Friday rush and grab one now before Prime Day is over.</p>\n\n\n<span>The iPad mini is just $349 today</span><div><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2481357/apples-cheapest-ipads-are-really-really-cheap-for-prime-day.html\" target=\"_blank\">GET IT NOW</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3d2ee3764e078338bfe2eedfc28ea8d2ac155869f994bcba5f8fbc6839e8d547","category":"Apple"}
