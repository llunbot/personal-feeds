{"title":"AltStore PAL Is Free of Charge, Thanks to ‘MegaGrant’ From Epic Games","link":"https://x.com/altstoreio/status/1823826343085433226","date":1738711431000,"content":"\n<p>Apple, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/hot_tob_hardcore_porno_app_eu\">in its media statement re: Hot Tub</a> (the you-have-to-admit-it’s-a-fun-name hardcore porn app now available in the AltStore PAL alternative app marketplace in the EU), closed its statement with the following: “The truth is that we are required by the European Commission to allow it to be distributed by marketplace operators like AltStore and Epic who may not share our concerns for user safety.”</p>\n\n<p>On X, Epic CEO <a href=\"https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1886533813444207012\">Tim Sweeney wrote</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Contrary to Apple’s false statement, the Epic Games Store doesn’t\ncarry this app, doesn’t carry any porn apps, and has never carried\nporn apps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Epic Games does run <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile/ios\">an alternative app marketplace for iOS in the EU</a>, and Sweeney is correct that neither Hot Tub, nor any other porno apps, are in it. But what Apple is alluding to here is Epic’s financial backing of AltStore by way of an “<a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/megagrants\">Epic MegaGrant</a>”. AltStore <a href=\"https://x.com/altstoreio/status/1823826343085433226\">announced the grant back in August</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>GOOD NEWS EU 🇪🇺 For innovation in app distribution, Epic Games has\ngranted us a MegaGrant grant that we plan to use to cover Apple’s\nCore Technology Fee going forward — and we won’t take it for\ngranted!</p>\n\n<p>What does this mean? AltStore PAL is now FREE — no subscription\nnecessary 🎉</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Prior to the grant, AltStore PAL charged €1.50 per installation to cover Apple’s <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/\">Core Technology Fee</a>, the rules for which have <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=d0z8d8rx\">gotten more complicated</a> since originally announced, but for app marketplaces themselves (like AltStore PAL) costs €0.50 per-user per-first-installation per-year. After the grant from Epic, AltStore PAL became a free download.</p>\n\n<p>Is it fair for Apple to lay AltStore PAL’s content decisions at Epic’s feet? I’d say it’s more fair than describing Hot Tub as “approved” by Apple for having been notarized.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/04/altstore-pal-epic\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"25eecf81a7957ccc0bc613ae39d0ccae827bec4830a9fd4008040a86e1c75237","category":"Tech"}
