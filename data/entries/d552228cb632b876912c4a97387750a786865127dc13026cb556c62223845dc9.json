Car swaps went away a long time ago, but when the series gets back to racing next month in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the mid-race pit stop will be back. Except this time, the cars will be quickly recharged by powerful 600 kW fast chargers.</p>\n<p>The new race feature, which Formula E is calling \"pit boost,\" is a 30-second pitstop, during which time the car receives a 600 kW fast charge—more than twice as much power as a Tesla Supercharger—that adds 10 percent (3.85 kWh) to the battery's state of charge. It's mandatory for every car in the race, but a team is only allowed to charge one of its two cars at a time and only within a specified window of time during the race.</p>\n<p>Some people are probably going to be unimpressed with the length of the stops—while they're shorter than you might see at a prototype stop at Le Mans or Daytona, you also won't see mechanics running around changing tires. We're also talking an order of magnitude longer than a current Formula 1 pitstop, which will no doubt be used as ammunition by Formula E's detractors, just as the lap-time comparisons are.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/600-kw-fast-charging-pitstops-are-coming-to-formula-e/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/600-kw-fast-charging-pitstops-are-coming-to-formula-e/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
