Well,<a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2021/10/were-hiring/\"> we put out a call for applications</a> for this position, had some great interviews, and were pleasantly surprised to find one of our endemic contributors fit the role perfectly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/dzil_Taah_Adventures-YellowDirt-80.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jweinberg/\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Weinberg</a> has penned and photographed some wonderful pieces for The Radavist over the years and his contributions will help with our vision for 2022 and beyond. For the past few years, he’s spent his time working for Arizona State University where he used SEO and other web tactics to grow its online degree programs. We’ll be tapping into Josh’s knowledge for growing The Radavist while leaning heavily on his photography and organizational skills to continue our pursuit of documenting cycling’s Radical Atavists.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/dzil_Taah_Adventures-YellowDirt-97.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/Telluride-to-Moab-on-the-San-Juan-Huts-Route-59.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>We compiled a list of some of the stories Josh has shared with The Radavist over the years below in our Related Archives, so take a few minutes to check those out!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/colin-take-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/bball.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/andrea.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/liv-sign.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I’d like to personally thank Josh for being such a solid companion over the years and look forward to seeing him grow his role here at The Radavist!
