The aluminium stem is compatible with either electronic or mechanical groupsets.</p>\n<p>On the rim brake versions of the bike, the front brake cable runs straight from the bar to the caliper, but all other cables or wires are integrated into the stem.</p>\n<p>The system is finished with the same streamlined spacers and headset top cover as used on bikes slightly higher up the Wilier range, including the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/wilier-filante-slr-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Filante SLR</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-wilier-cento10-sl/\" target=\"_blank\">Cento10</a> series.</p>\n<h2>Stiff and strong</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The geometry of the bike is quite racy, but not ridiculously so.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wilier</i></span></div>\n<p>At the core of the Garda is Willier’s NH-MOD carbon monocoque frame. NH-MOD is Wilier’s name for a blend of normal (N) and high (H) modulus carbon, offering a mix of stiffness and strength.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, the higher the modulus, the stiffer the carbon; the lower the modulus, the stronger (generally speaking, at least). By mixing high- and normal-modulus carbon, Wilier claims it is able to offer the best of both worlds in the Garda.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\" target=\"_blank\">geometry</a> is fairly racy, with 566mm stack and 388mm reach figures on a large frame, but it’s not outrageously aggressive, so should be suitable for long days in the saddle too.</p>\n<h2>Wilier Garda range and prices</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s increasingly rare to see a bike launched with rim brakes.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The Garda is available with either disc brakes or rim brakes, with prices ranging from £2,840 for the rim brake version with Shimano Ultegra R8000 to £4,890 for the disc version with Campagnolo Chorus.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike is also available in a SRAM AXS build.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wilier</i></span></div>\n<p>In keeping with the modern feel of the Garda, there’s also an electronic-shifting option courtesy of SRAM’s new Rival AXS groupset.</p>\n<p>Prices for the AXS version range from £4,070 to £4,680 based on whether the bike is specced with Wilier RX 26 wheels or Wilier NDR38 KC wheels respectively.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike is also available in an Ultegra R8000 build.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wilier</i></span></div>\n<p>There’s no Di2 option available, but for those who want disc brakes and a Shimano groupset, there is a mechanical Ultegra R8020 version. The price is £3,350 when specced with Shimano RS171 wheels, or £4,070 with Wilier’s NDR38 KC wheelset.</p>\n<p>International pricing is TBC.</p>","author":"Paddy Maddison","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"644ad9534b4353be8766bc04c0ee9a66cc4b3a56096792fb388dd2deef03f022","category":"Cycling"}
