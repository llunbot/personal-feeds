(credit: Ron Amadeo)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Google is coming for your unused Android crapware. The company <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/09/making-permissions-auto-reset-available.html\">announced Friday</a> that it will backport an Android 11 privacy feature—auto-resetting app permissions—to Android 6.</p>\n<p>Auto-resetting app permissions were introduced <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/android-11-the-ars-technica-review/#h5\">in Android 11</a> as part of a continually expanding Android feature set aiming to automatically limit apps you don't use. When you don't use an app for a set period of time, Android will automatically strip the app of any permissions it has been granted, limiting it from tracking you in the background or accessing data. It's a nice feature for less tech-savvy people who aren't interested in manually organizing the inner workings of their phones. If you open the app again, it can ask for all of those permissions again.</p>\n<p>Like most new Android features, auto-resetting permissions were exclusive to Android 11 when it came out last year—making up a very small number of Android's 3 billion active devices. Google's official Android Studio stats have Android 11 at <em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonAmadeo/status/1438875832294985728\">0 percent</a> </em>market share, but that chart hasn't been updated since Android 11 came out (update your chart, Google!).
