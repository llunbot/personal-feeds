You can use the new widget gallery to choose from a range of widgets, and then drag them to your Mac's desktop.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Widgets</a> can be arranged in any way that's useful, and when you're using an app, they are designed to fade into the background so they're less distracting. ‌Widgets‌ are more interactive than before, so you can use them to do things like play music, turn off the lights in your home, and more. Through Continuity, your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s widgets can also show up on your Mac's desktop.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVideo conferencing has improved with a new Presenter Overlay view that shows your desktop or project in new ways, plus Safari now supports web apps for the Dock and the option to create Profiles so you can separate personal browsing from work browsing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther new features include improved search that's faster and more responsive, password and passkey sharing, a revamped stickers interface for the Messages app, PDF integration in notes that makes it easier than ever to manage PDFs, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌macOS Sonoma‌ will be in beta testing for several months, with a public release coming this fall.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-beta-6/\">Apple Seeds Sixth Beta of macOS 14 Sonoma to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-sixth-beta-of-macos-14-sonoma-to-developers.2399333/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d3e43c3095656ec7cd21b61630d5a601c708bd5a8b4278a3053efab1db86d1dc","category":"Apple"}
