Staggeringly, you can expect up to a 30% decrease in your performance from just a 5% drop in hydration level – but there’s more to it than purely chugging water. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this buyer’s guide we delve into the role of electrolytes in exercise, and how you can best deliver them into the body, whether you prefer to use effervescent hydration tabs, a bulk hydration powder or ready-portioned hydration sachets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to electrolytes, we’ll check out the other popular choice that cyclists often add to their water bottles: energy powders. Whether that means topping up your carbohydrate levels in combination with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-energy-gels-bars-chews\" target=\"_blank\">energy gels, bars and chews </a>or opting for a high-carb drink mix, adding energy to your water is a great way to ensure a regular, quick-release source of carbs to keep fuelling the muscles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll share a selection of our favourite tried-and-tested electrolyte tabs and powders, as well as energy drink mixes, and some products that can do both, before going into more detail on exactly what you should be looking for in the best hydration and energy drinks to unlock your true performance potential, and why.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best hydration and energy drinks at a

drink?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to sports nutrition, taking in 60-90g plus of carbohydrates per hour is no easy feat, so adding carbs to your water bottles can be a great way to increase your intake without having to eat quite as much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Energy drinks are also commonplace in race settings as you can take on energy without having to reach for bars or struggle with energy gel wrappers, and you don’t have to chew either, so you can easily take on carbs even when breathing hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some riders prefer the taste of flavoured energy drinks to water, so it can also help you keep hydrated on the bike. Other riders like to mix it up, with one bottle of plain water and one drink mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why are electrolytes important?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you sweat during exercise, you’re not only losing water, but also salts; predominantly sodium, but also calcium, magnesium and potassium. These salts are crucial for many bodily functions including the maintenance of fluid balance and blood volume, plus nerve, muscle and cognitive function, so you need to replace them along with the lost water to avoid becoming dehydrated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dehydration not only reduces your performance potential, but it can also lead to issues like muscle cramping; just what you don’t need on the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electrolytes also help you to take up water more effectively, so it’s a win-win. Opt for them on hotter rides, long days out, and any time you find yourself sweating a lot, or after a ride to help you rehydrate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How many electrolytes do I need?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>How many electrolytes you need really depends on two factors: how much you sweat, and how salty your sweat is. This can vary widely from person to person and is largely driven by genetics. Many professional cyclists will undergo a sweat test to determine just how many salts they lose through their sweat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might notice that you easily get really sweaty on the bike, or that you barely sweat at all, even during more intense efforts. Or, like the majority of us, you’ll find yourself somewhere in the middle. The same goes for how salty your sweat is. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have an idea of these factors, you can start to look at your electrolyte dosage. Some electrolyte tabs are very concentrated, with up to 1000mg sodium (like the Precision Fuel and Styrkr ones), so these are great for riders who sweat a lot or have very salty sweat. Equally, they can easily be halved for less sweaty riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some <a href=\"https://www.precisionhydration.com/performance-advice/hydration/how-to-measure-your-sweat-rate/\" target=\"_blank\">handy guides online</a> to help you estimate your sweat rate and work out how many electrolytes you’ll need.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Which is better, individual sachets or bulk mix?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re buying an electrolyte or carbohydrate powder, you often get the choice of individual sachets or bulk, but which is better?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That really depends on how you intend to use it. Individual sachets are really handy if you’re planning a longer ride and you want to take some with you to top up your bottles when you refill with water. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bulk tubs cut down on waste and are generally more economical per serving, though only really work if you’re starting your ride from home unless you have small refillable packages to decant into.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Should I buy a drink mix or electrolyte tab with caffeine?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are certainly benefits to consuming <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/can-caffeine-make-you-ride-your-bike-faster\" target=\"_blank\">benefits to consuming caffeine</a>, which has been shown to improve mental focus and reduce the perception of pain. However, just like downing ten coffees a day, if you overdo it, it loses its potency (and can cause a whole other heap of negative health impacts). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders who take on caffeine through electrolyte tabs and drink mixes (as well as gels and some other nutrition products) tend to save them for nearer the end of their rides or races when they need that final extra kick, or at a time just before a big effort, such as a significant climb. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The level of caffeine included in drink mixes and electrolyte tabs is typically the same as between one and two shots of espresso.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What about drink mix hygiene?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important one – as many electrolyte mixes contain carbohydrates, you’ll need to make sure you wash <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-water-bottles-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">your bottles</a> thoroughly after each ride. Otherwise, the sugars will not only feed you, but a whole host of bacteria and moulds as your bottles are left in the shed, ready to be topped up and drunk on your next ride…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Prefer to keep your hydration and fuel separate?
