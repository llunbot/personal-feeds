It further recommends that the UN take steps to empower poorer nations, especially those in the global south, to benefit from AI and contribute to its governance. These should include, it says, creating an AI fund to back projects in these nations, establishing AI standards and data-sharing systems, and creating resources such as training to help nations with AI governance. Some of the report’s recommendations could be facilitated by the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/summit-of-the-future/global-digital-compact\">Global Digital Compact</a>, an existing plan to address digital and data divides between nations. It finally suggests creating an AI office within the UN dedicated to coordinating existing efforts within the UN to meet the report’s goals.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051232#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051232&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"132c48716b843b47c39eebb09950512ef1ecf63cefa5a58016aef3045f32c5fb","category":"Tech"}
