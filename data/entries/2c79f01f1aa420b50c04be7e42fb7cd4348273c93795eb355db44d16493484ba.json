Shelest admitted the bad look but said that his experience with people search gave Onerep \"the best tech and team in the space.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012417#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012417&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2c79f01f1aa420b50c04be7e42fb7cd4348273c93795eb355db44d16493484ba","category":"Tech"}
