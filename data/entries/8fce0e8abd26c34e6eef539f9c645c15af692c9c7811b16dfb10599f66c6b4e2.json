In the Safari section of the Settings app, there is now a \"Show Recent Searches\" option that can be toggled off.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisabling Show Recent Searches returns the Safari search interface to its iOS 18.3.2 behavior, where recent searches are not shown when tapping into the search window of a new tab.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple appears to have added the option to toggle off the search feature after receiving feedback during the iOS 18.4 beta testing period.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile some users may like the option to have recent searches readily available when opening up a new Safari tab, having searches so visible may not be desirable for those who sometimes need to hand over their iPhones and iPads to someone else.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18.4 is still being beta tested, with Apple aiming for an early April launch date. The update also includes new emoji characters, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> Priority Notifications, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/\">Visual Intelligence</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> Pro, a Vision Pro app, and more.
