Apple may never make the Touch Bar again, but fortunately, the folks at Eniac have taken on the task of creating a replacement that it calls the Flexbar. The company is currently raising funds on <a href=\"http://kck.st/49r7B36\">Kickstarter</a> to complete the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Flexbar is a long, narrow OLED touchscreen control strip–you can place it anywhere, even at the top of your keyboard like a Touch Bar. It connects to the Mac through USB and appears to work like the Touch Bar did. But it can also be used in a vertical orientation if that suits your workflow, and it can also connect to iPads, iPhones, and Windows PCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flexbar offers more customization than the Touch Bar ever did, and the company says it will offer API support for developers. There’s also a Flexbar Designer app that allows users to personalize the Flexbar’s controls and a Discord community where you can get help and tips with tweaking the Flexbar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It appears that Eniac has already exceeded its fundraising goal, even with 29 days left, but you can still make a pledge. Plans start at $119/£94, which includes the Flexbar, an aluminum stand, and a 2-meter USB-C cable. The Kickstarter event ends on January 2, 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Know a few people who would absolutely love this… just mad curious how they managed to source the display panel for such a low volume gadget.
