The site included the ability to upload a headshot that would be integrated into an AI-generated tableau of what you might look like on that vacation.</p>\n<p>But Megan (last name not given), a 50-year-old from Olympia suburb Tumwater, <a href=\"https://mynorthwest.com/3956403/rantz-washingtons-lottery-ai-porn-user/\">told conservative Seattle radio host Jason Rantz</a> that the image of her \"swim with the sharks\" dream vacation on the website showed her face atop a woman sitting on a bed with her breasts exposed. The background of the AI-generated image seems to show the bed in some sort of aquarium, complete with fish floating through the air and sprawling undersea flora sitting awkwardly behind the pillows.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015007#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015007&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9fe2601b567b0b44b22bcb746223fd0d2a726b73039c0e55aabe0533730c64e7","category":"Tech"}
