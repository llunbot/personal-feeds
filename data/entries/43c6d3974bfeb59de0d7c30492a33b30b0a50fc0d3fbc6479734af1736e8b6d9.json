There was no damage reported, but the car did require a realignment.<blockquote>A test vehicle, operating in autonomous mode in Sunnyvale and turning right from Mathilda Avenue onto Del Ray Avenue, made contact with a curb at approximately 13 miles per hour. While there was no tire or wheel damage, the contact resulted in misalignment. No other agents were involved, no injuries were reported, and law enforcement was not called to the scene.</blockquote>The incident occurred when the vehicle was turning right from Mathilda Avenue onto Del Ray Avenue, a location that is right near Apple's Mathilda Avenue location.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's self-driving vehicles have been involved in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/apple-self-driving-cars-minor-collisions/\">several very minor accidents</a>, but most have been caused by other drivers and while not in autonomous mode. This is the second event that has occurred where an Apple vehicle <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/31/apple-test-vehicle-august-24-accident/\">was being operated</a> in autonomous mode.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has been testing its self-driving software since early 2017, using the aforementioned Lexus RX 450h vehicles outfitted with sensors and cameras in the area around its Cupertino campuses. The work on autonomous driving is part of Apple's longtime car project, and rumors suggest Apple is planning to release a vehicle in the mid to late 2020s.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/12/apple-self-driving-car-clips-curb/\">Apple Self-Driving Car Needed a Realignment After Clipping Curb in Autonomous Mode</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-self-driving-car-needed-a-realignment-after-clipping-curb-in-autonomous-mode.2316627/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=E15JH48DwsY:fEr55YbwzAo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=E15JH48DwsY:fEr55YbwzAo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/E15JH48DwsY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"43c6d3974bfeb59de0d7c30492a33b30b0a50fc0d3fbc6479734af1736e8b6d9","category":"Apple"}
