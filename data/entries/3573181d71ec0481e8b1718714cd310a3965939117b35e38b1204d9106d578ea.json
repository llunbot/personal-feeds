{"title":"AWS Weekly Roundup – Amazon MWAA, EMR Studio, Generative AI, and More – August 14, 2023","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-weekly-roundup-amazon-mwaa-emr-studio-generative-ai-and-more-august-14-2023/","date":1692033725000,"content":"<p>While I enjoyed a few days off in California to get a dose of vitamin sea, a lot has happened in the AWS universe. Let’s take a look together!</p> \n<p><strong><span>Last Week’s Launches</span> </strong><br /> Here are some launches that got my attention:</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon MWAA now supports Apache Airflow version 2.6</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow/\">Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (Amazon MWAA)</a> is a managed orchestration service for Apache Airflow that you can use to set up and operate end-to-end data pipelines in the cloud. Apache Airflow version 2.6 introduces important security updates and bug fixes that enhance the security and reliability of your workflows. If you’re currently running Apache Airflow version 2.x, you can now seamlessly upgrade to version 2.6.3. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/introducing-apache-airflow-version-2-6-3-support-on-amazon-mwaa/\">Check out this AWS Big Data Blog post to learn more</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon EMR Studio adds support for AWS Lake Formation fine-grained access control</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/studio/\">Amazon EMR Studio</a> is a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for fully managed Jupyter notebooks that run on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/emr/\">Amazon EMR</a> clusters. When you connect to EMR clusters from EMR Studio workspaces, you can now choose the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role</a> that you want to connect with. Apache Spark interactive notebooks will access only the data and resources permitted by policies attached to this runtime IAM role. When data is accessed from data lakes managed with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/\">AWS Lake Formation</a>, you can enforce table and column-level access using policies attached to this runtime role. For more details, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-studio-runtime.html\">have a look at the Amazon EMR documentation.</a></p> \n<p><strong>AWS Security Hub launches 12 new security controls </strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/\">AWS Security Hub</a> is a cloud security posture management (CSPM) service that performs security best practice checks, aggregates alerts, and enables automated remediation. With the newly released controls, Security Hub now supports three additional AWS services: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/athena/\">Amazon Athena</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/\">Amazon DocumentDB</a> (with MongoDB compatibility), and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/\">Amazon Neptune</a>. Security Hub has also added an additional control against <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/\">Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)</a>. AWS Security Hub now offers 276 controls. You can find <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html\">more information in the AWS Security Hub documentation</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Additional AWS services available in the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region</strong> – The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-israel-tel-aviv-region/\">AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region opened on August 1, 2023</a>.
