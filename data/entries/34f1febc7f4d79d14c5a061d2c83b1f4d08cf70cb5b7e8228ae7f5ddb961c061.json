{"title":"GM Floats a Bullshit ‘Safety’ Excuse for Dropping CarPlay","link":"https://www.motortrend.com/news/general-motors-removing-apple-carplay-android-auto-for-safety-tim-babbitt/","date":1702617124000,"content":"\n<p>Scott Evans, writing for MotorTrend regarding GM’s announcement earlier this year that they’d be dropping CarPlay (and Android Auto) support from future vehicles:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tim Babbitt, GM’s head of product for infotainment, gave MT a \nbetter explanation at a press event for the new Chevrolet Blazer \nEV, the flagship vehicle in the no CarPlay or Android Auto \nstrategy (and <a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/chevrolet-blazer-ev-2024-suv-of-the-year/\">our 2023 <em>MotorTrend</em> SUV of the Year \nwinner</a>). According to him, there’s an important factor that \ndidn’t make it into the fact sheet: safety. Specifically, he cited \ndriver distraction caused by cell phone usage behind the wheel. </p>\n\n<p>According to Babbitt, CarPlay and Android Auto have stability \nissues that manifest themselves as bad connections, poor \nrendering, slow responses, and dropped connections. And when \nCarPlay and Android Auto have issues, drivers pick up their phones \nagain, taking their eyes off the road and totally defeating the \npurpose of these phone-mirroring programs. Solving those issues \ncan sometimes be beyond the control of the automaker. You can \nstart to see GM’s frustration. </p>\n\n<p>Babbitt’s thesis is that if drivers were to do everything \nthrough the vehicle’s built-in systems, they’d be less likely to \npick up their phones and therefore less distracted and safer \nbehind the wheel. He admits, though, GM hasn’t tested this \nthesis in the lab or real world yet but believes it has \npotential, if customers go for it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a load of horseshit. If CarPlay is unsafe, why isn’t GM recalling all its existing cars that have it equipped? And that last sentence is the real kicker: hasn’t been tested, even in a lab, but he’s just guessing. In his imagined scenario, people check their phones while driving when the CarPlay connection flakes out. But if the car doesn’t support CarPlay, people will use their phones for every single thing that’s on their phones but not in GM’s built-in system. “If drivers were to do everything through the vehicle’s built-in systems” is as much a fantasy as, say, “If drivers always obeyed all posted speed limits.” It’s not going to happen. There is no plausible scenario where the drivers of future GM vehicles without CarPlay support check their iPhones less frequently than they do in vehicles that support CarPlay.</p>\n\n<p>As GM continues to try to dig their way out of this idiotic hole, Ford CEO Jim Farley <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/05/ford-ceo-jim-farley-carplay\">continues</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimfarley98/status/1735016894996840758\">to laugh</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We’re committed to keeping Apple CarPlay &amp; Android Auto. @Ford \ncustomers love the features because they help keep their eyes on \nthe road and hands on the wheel. We work closely with Apple &amp; \nGoogle to create a very high-quality experience for customers. And \nI think we have the best experience out there with SYNC 4A. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s enough to make you think that GM’s decision to drop CarPlay was made by moles in the company planted by Ford.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/15/gm-bullshit-on-carplay\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"34f1febc7f4d79d14c5a061d2c83b1f4d08cf70cb5b7e8228ae7f5ddb961c061","category":"Tech"}
