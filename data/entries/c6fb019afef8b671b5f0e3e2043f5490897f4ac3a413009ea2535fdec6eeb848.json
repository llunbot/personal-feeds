We call it Apple Breakfast because we think it goes great with a Monday morning cup of coffee or tea, but it’s cool if you want to give it a read during lunch or dinner hours too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The only way is upsell</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the quirkier stories we covered last week centered on a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1969195/apple-vision-pro-headset-strap-accessory-extra-charge.html\">simple Velcro strap</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s upcoming Vision Pro headset, you see, is rather heavy, and the company seems to have addressed possible issues with comfort by adding on an extra strap that goes over the top of the user’s head. But this strap is depicted nowhere in the press photos, and (according to the Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman) is likely to cost extra on top of the standard $3,499 price tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you spend that sort of money on a product, you’d hope that comfort would be priced in. (And it’s entirely possible, we should stress, that it will be. For now this is merely a rumor.) But the idea that the strap won’t be included in the box is sadly compatible with Apple’s broader strategy in recent years. Apple has become the king of the upsell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all started, for me at least, with the charger. In 2020 Apple made the decision to stop including a power adapter with new iPhones, using the pretext that most customers already owned one, and that they were all ending up in landfill. Handy, then, that the move also enabled Apple to reduce the size of boxes and cut costs without lowering the price. And of course Apple will still happily <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-1967034-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHJA3AM/A/20w-usb-c-power-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">sell you an adapter</a> for an extra $19 if you haven’t got one lying around. The company also stopped including EarPods in iPhone boxes, which means more AirPods sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, I’m not saying the environmental justification was entirely disingenuous. But I do strongly suspect that Apple found a genuinely worthwhile idea more appealing because it could be used to squeeze out bigger profits. If the company sincerely wanted to reduce tech waste in landfill, after all, it would make its phones compatible with a global connection standard rather than a proprietary one before being forced to do so by regulatory pressure. But proprietary cables and chargers are better for upsell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, Apple went all-out on the upsell strategy. It wasn’t enough for customers to spend $799 on a new iPhone 14; the company gave that device a year-old processor and generally did all it could to push customers who could possibly afford it to get the $999 14 Pro instead. (In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1073091/iphone-14-review.html\">review</a>, we called the 14 “basically an iPhone 13s.”) Similarly, the Apple Watch Series 8 was barely an improvement on its predecessor–why bother with the Series 8, when you’ve got the Apple Watch Ultra to push–and the AirPods Pro were heavily pushed over the standard AirPods. Every company wants you to buy their most expensive models, but for Apple that year it became an obvious and calculated strategy to an extent never seen before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s difficult to argue with decisions made by a company that just touched a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/30/aapl-stock-high/&amp;xcust=1-1-1967034-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$3 trillion market cap</a> (again). But this sort of thing–gouging out an extra $400 for wheels, when your customer has already shelled out $6,999 for a Mac Pro–might not be wise in the long term. It can get people’s backs up, eroding goodwill towards your brand, but more importantly, it makes your entry-level products seem a bit, well, rubbish. And those who can’t afford the iPhone 14 Pro or the Apple Watch Ultra or the Vision Strap Plus might decide to give up on the idea entirely and spend their money elsewhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Have your say</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the readers who got in touch about last week’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1957801/siri-disaster-apple-doesnt-care.html\">Siri-bashing column</a>. I was reassured to discover that some of you are even angrier about the state of Apple’s error-prone personal assistant than I am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard Raymond-Smith, for example, complained bitterly about Siri’s apparent regression. It used to be able to respond to natural-language queries about a journey’s ETA, he notes, but now unhelpfully replies along the lines of “Here’s what I found on the web about ETA…” That’s a big fail, Siri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert Williams, meanwhile, finds it “mystifying that Apple continues to sully its reputation for excellent products by muddling along with a product that is VASTLY inferior to, say, Alexa,” and ponders why any of the company’s software engineers would willingly work on Siri, given the embarrassment factor when revealing this in conversation. And Gus Pistolis throws down a challenge: “How do we mount a grassroots effort to get Apple to create a better if not new Siri?” The campaign starts here!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drop me an email if you’ve got any strong opinions about this week’s piece above; I can’t respond to them all, but I do read them. No promises, but I might include a few more reader comments next week.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3811721/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews corner</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1968214/affinity-photo-review.html\">Affinity Photo review</a>: An affordable Photoshop alternative.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230919/pixelmator-pro-review.html\">Pixelmator Pro review</a>: An affordable alternative for Photoshop pro users.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trending: Top stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Does anyone actually <strong>enjoy working at Apple</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1968386/macalope-apple-employee-relations-retail-app-store.html\">asks the Macalope</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets out, everyone.
