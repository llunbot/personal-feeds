As Sky Hi News reports, the birthplace of Moots and Eriksen was just listed for $2.4 million dollars:</p>\n<p>“The 6,771-square-foot property is now for sale for $2.4 million, and it includes the three-story building where Moots, one of the first purpose-built mountain bike manufacturers in the country, got its start. There are also two additions that were built more recently. The building is owned by Kent Eriksen and Bruce Alston, who teamed up in the late 1980s to provide a space where Eriksen’s Sore Saddle Cyclery business could expand into a year-round operation.”</p>\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/a-slice-of-cycling-history-at-orange-peel-bikes-in-steamboat-springs/\" target=\"_blank\">2018 Shop Visits to Orange Peel Bikes</a>, Eriksen/<a href=\"https://theradavist.com/building-on-legacy-eriksen-cycles-and-bingham-built/\" target=\"_blank\">Bingham Built</a>, and <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/inside-moots-the-masters-of-metal/\" target=\"_blank\">Moots</a> in our Archives below.</p>\n<p>Read the full story at <a href=\"https://www.skyhinews.com/news/birthplace-of-modern-mountain-biking-listed-for-2-4m/\" target=\"_blank\">Sky Hi News</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-iconic-orange-peel-bikes-is-listed-for-sale/\">The Iconic Orange Peel Bikes is Listed for Sale</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"b4efe3d49bbe4d47e87ed1a3a16648825e76ea1f49bbeeadbd00df01b677eece","category":"Cycling"}
