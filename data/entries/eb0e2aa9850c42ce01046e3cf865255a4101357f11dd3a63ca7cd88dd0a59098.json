After all, isn’t that what we do day in, day out, in glamorous locations, on expensive bikes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, the truth is more prosaic. The majority of my time is spent sitting in front of a laptop, mostly in my own kitchen, which is why, when the family summer holiday rolls around, I can’t help building in an opportunity to escape for a day on two wheels.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/specialized-tarmac-sl8-news\">A funky nose job and skinny back end make the new Specialized Tarmac SL8 faster than the Venge</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2023\">The best photos from the Tour de France Femmes 2023</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a España 2023: Stage-by-stage preview and everything we know so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>This year it was Italy. While sitting by Lake Garda, I persuaded my family (all non-cyclists) that it wouldn’t be too far out of our way to nip up to the northern border of the country for a day so I could have a crack at a climb that has been on my must-tick list since, well… forever: the Stelvio Pass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a climb steeped in the legends of the Giro d’Italia; a climb of 24km in length with 1,832m of ascent; a climb that topped the list of ‘Cyclist’s 100 Classic Climbs’. It is beautiful and brutal in equal measure, and I was blessed with a blue-sky day when I set out from the small town at its foot and headed for its snow-speckled summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only problem was, seemingly half of Italy had had the same idea. Not just other cyclists, but everyone in every form of transport had decided that this day would be a good day to head up the Stelvio. Packs of leather-clad bikers roared past, fighting for space with tourist buses and caravans that got stuck on the tighter hairpins. An outing of a Porsche-owners’ club snaked past, dozens of them in a long line of noise. People on e-bikes cruised by, trying not to catch the eyes of anyone sweating upwards on leg power alone. It was heaving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still loved it, but it reminded me that there is a wealth of amazing climbs out there that are still mostly undiscovered by the hordes of col-baggers and petrol heads. One of them is La Cubilla in northern Spain, the destination for this month’s Big Ride. Big numbers, great views, no crowds. Looks like a Spanish holiday is on the cards for next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photo </strong>Patrik Lundin</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>What’s in issue 143?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A <em>grande</em> day out:</strong> On the southern edge of Asturias in northern Spain sits a small town surrounded by big climbs…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ready, aim, shoot!</strong> Closed roads, rowdy crowds, stroppy officials, burning clutches… and it’s only Stage 1.
