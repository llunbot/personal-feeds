He played a key role in some of the original mountain bike brands, before running his own bike company for 15 years. Over his 40-year career he has played a part in fabricating over 4200 bicycle frames locally. He was inducted into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in 2005, and taught his own successful Framebuilding 101 class until 2020.</p>\n<p>This show features a collection of Paul’s completely hand-built, one-of-kind bikes that have never been displayed together. They have set trends and won international awards over the past four decades. Up close you’ll be able to understand the attention to detail and unique blend of craft and artistry. Some of the stories behind the builds are almost as good as the bikes themselves, and Paul will be in attendance to share his insights.</p>\n<p>SCHEDULE</p>\n<p>SATURDAY JUNE 15</p>\n<p>11am – Open<br />\n1pm – Guided Tour with Paul<br />\n6pm – Meet and Greet with Paul<br />\n7pm – 10pm – Opening Party</p>\n<p>SUNDAY JUNE 16</p>\n<p>11am – Open<br />\n1pm – Guided Tour with Paul<br />\n4pm – Close</p>\n<p>TICKETS: $20<br />\nOne ticket gives you access for the whole weekend.</p>\n<p>Early bird tickets bought online before March 1st get a free show booklet featuring beautiful photos and stories of all the show bicycles.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/paul-brodies-bicycle-show/\">Don’t Miss Paul Brodie’s Bicycle Show at First Light Frames</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"80b8fef1b22c75788eee5fa35e008fd75cb6984999cd484ecd2cd8e6cf79721c","category":"Cycling"}
