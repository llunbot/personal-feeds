In the human body, a protein with the same name might also be able to bring some life back to an aging brain.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00441-x\">study</a> published today in the journal Nature Aging, researchers at Yale and the University of California, San Francisco found that a single injection of the klotho protein led to modest improvements in cognitive function in older monkeys and that the effects lasted for two weeks. The authors think the protein represents a promising avenue for researching the rejuvenation of brain function in older adults.</p>\n<p>“Cognitive decline from aging is one of our most pressing biomedical problems without truly effective medicines,” says Dena Dubal, a professor of neurology at UCSF and the study’s senior author. After discovering—accidentally—in previous work that klotho boosts cognition in mice, she says, “it became important to test this in a brain like ours.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951617#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951617&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9c2b2b8d46aa545b0c4f15aee7fc5b4ae48a14e099d0f564c40d2432e6df18bd","category":"Tech"}
