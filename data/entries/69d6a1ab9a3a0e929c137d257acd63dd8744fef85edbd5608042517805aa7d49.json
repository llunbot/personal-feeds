Taking rider safety to a new level – even beyond rear-facing radar – the RS 1000 system combines a live rear-view camera streamed directly to a smartphone on your handlebars, AI-powered alerts, dashcam-style incident recording, a smart taillight/brake light, and even ebike system integration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you think AI detection of risky drivers could make urban cyclists safer?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Beam Ride Safety System RS 1000, safer cycling with AI</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Beam-Ride-Safety-System-RS-1000-safer-cycling-powered-by-AI-incident-detection_on-bike.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Beam-Ride-Safety-System-RS-1000-safer-cycling-powered-by-AI-incident-detection_on-bike.webp\" alt=\"The Beam Ride Safety System RS 1000 is a smart taillight for safer cycling, powered by AI incident detection, on-bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Beam-Ride-Safety-System-RS-1000-safer-cycling-powered-by-AI-incident-detection_on-bike.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Beam-Ride-Safety-System-RS-1000-safer-cycling-powered-by-AI-incident-detection_on-bike-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Beam-Ride-Safety-System-RS-1000-safer-cycling-powered-by-AI-incident-detection_on-bike-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Beam-Ride-Safety-System-RS-1000-safer-cycling-powered-by-AI-incident-detection_on-bike-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Beam-Ride-Safety-System-RS-1000-safer-cycling-powered-by-AI-incident-detection_on-bike-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Beam-Ride-Safety-System-RS-1000-safer-cycling-powered-by-AI-incident-detection_on-bike-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/The Beam &amp; Alp Alpine)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Beam thinks their RS 1000 connected smart taillight and live-view display system can make urban commuters, ebikers, and even long-distance road cyclists safer, by making it easier to see and be seen. Already focused on bringing more conventional safety equipment to a wider audience, like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-beam-virgo-integral-helmet-gives-ebike-commuters-extra-full-face-protection-review/\">helmets</a> and tiny <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/friday-roundup-womens-torino-nice-adventure-rearview-mirror-win-campy-ekar-or-a-ripmo-more/\" target=\"_blank\">mirrors</a>, now <a href=\"https://thebeamofficial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Beam</a> wants to leverage more technology to keep riders safe together with tech company Alps Alpine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They say “<em>maintaining full situational awareness while navigating busy roads is a constant struggle for cyclists</em>“. And while their tiny mirrors aim to make it a bit easier to see what’s coming up behind you without fully taking your eyes off the road ahead, they admit it’s not a great solution either.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So The Beam’s new fix is an AI-powered rear-view camera system.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
