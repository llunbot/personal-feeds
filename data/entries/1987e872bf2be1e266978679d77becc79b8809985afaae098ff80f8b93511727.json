This group is dedicated to empowering and connecting women, providing a supportive environment to explore cloud computing. In Latin America, we recently had the privilege of supporting 12 women-led <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/usergroups/?community-user-groups-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.ugName&amp;community-user-groups-cards.sort-order=asc&amp;awsf.location=*all&amp;awsf.category=*all\">AWS User Groups</a> from 10 countries in organizing two regional AWSome Women Community Summits, reaching over 800 women builders. There’s still more work to be done, but initiatives like these highlight the power of community in fostering an inclusive and diverse tech environment.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/07/27/2024-aws-community-collage.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/07/27/2024-aws-community-collage-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Women-Led AWS Community Events\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" /></a></p> \n<p>Now, let’s turn our attention to other exciting news in the AWS universe from last week.</p> \n<p><strong><span>Last week’s launches<br /> </span></strong>Here are some launches that got my attention:</p> \n<p><strong>Meta Llama 3.1 models</strong> – The Llama 3.1 models are Meta’s most advanced and capable models to date. The Llama 3.1 models are a collection of 8B, 70B, and 405B parameter size models that demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of industry benchmarks and offer new capabilities for your generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) applications. Llama 3.1 models are now available in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a> (see <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-llama-3-1-405b-70b-and-8b-models-from-meta-in-amazon-bedrock/\">Announcing Llama 3.1 405B, 70B, and 8B models from Meta in Amazon Bedrock</a>) and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/jumpstart/\">Amazon SageMaker JumpStart</a> (see <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/meta-llama-3-1-models-are-now-available-in-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/\">Llama 3.1 models are now available in Amazon SageMaker JumpStart</a>).</p> \n<p>My colleagues <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiffanysouterre\">Tiffany</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikegchambers\">Mike</a> explored Llama 3.1 in last week’s episode of the weekly <a href=\"https://community.aws/livestreams/build-on-generative-ai\">Build On Generative AI</a> live stream. You can <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2207259615\">watch the full episode here</a>!</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/07/26/2024-buildon-genai-llama31.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/07/26/2024-buildon-genai-llama31.png\" alt=\"BuildOn Generative AI Llama 3.1 launch\" width=\"1001\" height=\"528\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong>Mistral Large 2 model</strong> – Mistral Large 2 is the newest version of Mistral Large, and according to Mistral AI, it offers significant improvements across multilingual capabilities, math, reasoning, coding, and much more. Mistral AI’s Mistral Large 2 foundation model (FM) is now available in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a>. See <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/mistral-large-2-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/\">Mistral Large 2 is now available in Amazon Bedrock</a> for all the details. You can find code examples in the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/mistral-on-aws\">Mistral-on-AWS repo</a> and the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/service_code_examples_bedrock-runtime_mistral_ai.html\">Amazon Bedrock User Guide</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Faster auto scaling for generative AI models</strong> – This new capability in Amazon SageMaker inference can help you reduce the time it takes for your generative AI models to scale automatically. You can now use sub-minute metrics and significantly reduce overall scaling latency for generative AI models. With this enhancement, you can improve the responsiveness of your generative AI applications as demand fluctuates.
