{"title":"Report: Ellingworth to take over Ineos cycling team, Brailsford set for new role","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/report-ellingworth-to-take-over-ineos-cycling-team-as-brailsford-set-for-new-role/","date":1632240273000,"content":"<div><div><p>According to report from <a href=\"https://www.tuttobiciweb.it/article/2021/09/20/1631950276/ineos-brailsford-ellingworth-manager\" target=\"_blank\">TuttoBiciWeb</a>, Dave Brailsford may be taking on a new role after more than a decade as the manager of the Ineos Grenadiers team.</p><p>TuttoBiciWeb reports that Brailsford is set to move into a leadership position higher up in the sports division at Ineos, with Rod Ellingworth apparently set to take over as the manager of the Ineos Grenadiers.</p><p>In addition to sponsoring the British WorldTour squad, petrochemical giant Ineos also has sponsorship interests in Formula One, sailing, rugby, and football (soccer), and last year, the company also sponsored Eliud Kipchoge’s effort to run the marathon distance in under two hours.</p><p>Brailsford, 57, has managed the team formerly known as Sky since its inception in 2010. During his tenure, team members have won seven Tours de France, along with scoring a bevy of other major results.</p><p>Brailsford said earlier this year that there was a chance that “any further health issues” could lead to him calling time on his tenure with the Ineos Grenadiers; he underwent treatment for prostate cancer in 2019 and underwent heart surgery earlier this year. Any connection between that sentiment and the potential job change is unclear, but according to TuttoBiciWeb, his departure from the cycling team won’t represent a departure from sport altogether.</p><p>Ellingworth, who will reportedly replace Brailsford, is now in his second stint with the squad. Ellingworth spent years with the team that was known as Sky for the majority of his time there, spent most of 2020 as the team principal at Bahrain-McLaren, and then returned to the Ineos Grenadiers at the start of the season to serve as Director of Racing.</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"a504812a140c142d7140b488fa573661d00127e8e192c5efb558f64e0cc4caee","category":"Cycling"}
