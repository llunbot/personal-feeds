For Mathieu van der Poel and Lotte Kopecky, this would be their third De Ronde titles if victorious. And while one world champion's race went to script, one did not.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>The men’s race, won by Van der Poel, certainly went as expected, especially after the Dutchman’s key rival Wout van Aert withdrew from the race after being involved in a crash at Dwars door Vlaanderen which saw him undergo surgery. But the women’s race didn’t quite unfold in the same predictable way, especially for SD Worx-Protime, who were absent from the podium – a rarity for the Dutch squad. Instead, the finish came down to a sprint between three riders – Elisa Longo Borghini, Kasia Niewiadoma and Shirin van Anrooij – with Longo Borghini adding a second edition of this fabled Monument title to her <em>palmarès</em>.</span></p>\n<p><span>As riders crossed the line after hours of hard racing with mud-splattered faces, their expressions said it all. Lidl-Trek and Alpecin-Deceuninck's of elation, wide smiles spread across their faces and celebratory hugs shared. But for others, </span>grimaces remained, reflective of the sombre skies above, and soft taps on the shoulders of teammates signalled a shared disappointment, beaten by the bergs of Flanders for another year. </p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Tornanti_cc-RVV-WMN-20240331-132247-7819E.jpg?v=1712056110\" /></div>\n<p><span>World champion Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) in her fresh white kit alongside Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck) at the start of the race in Oudenaarde.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Tornanti_cc-RVV-WMN-20240331-132050-7684E.jpg?v=1712056211\" /></div>\n<p><span>EF Education’s <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/classy-for-the-classics-ef-education-s-special-edition-tour-of-flanders-switch-out-kit\">new kit by Rapha designed specifically for this edition of the Tour of Flanders</a>.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Tornanti_cc-RVV-20240331-092108-2845F.jpg?v=1712056300\" /></div>\n<p><span>It was blue skies in Antwerp for the start of the men’s race.
