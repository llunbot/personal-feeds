A chunky battery pack","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2772497/apples-solution-to-the-iphone-17-airs-poor-battery-life-a-chunky-battery-pack.html","date":1746525655000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple unveils the iPhone 17 this fall, the model everyone will be talking about will be the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2746004/apples-thin-iphone-17-air-looks-great-its-also-a-terrible-idea.html\">iPhone 17 Air</a>. With an incredibly thin body and new design, Apple is looking to inject some innovation into the lineup with a brand new phone that defies expectations and turns heads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only problem is, all that thinness will also bring some necessary sacrifices, most notably with a smaller battery. Reports claim that the iPhone 17 Air will have Apple’s worst battery life of all the new iPhones—so bad, in fact, that <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles\">a new report</a> by The Information claims more than a quarter of users won’t be able to get through a full day on a single charge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might be an acceptable sacrifice for some, but Apple is keenly aware that other iPhone 17 Air buyers might want a full day of battery life even on heavy days. For those users, Apple will reportedly revive its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667979/apple-smart-battery-case-for-iphone-11-family-review.html\">Smart Battery Case</a>, which originally launched with the iPhone 6 in 2015. Apple stopped selling the case in 2021 when the MagSafe Battery Pack arrived. The battery pack lasted until 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Smart Battery Case did a fine job of keeping your iPhone filled up throughout the day, but it wasn’t the prettiest thing, with a white silicone shell surrounding a fairly bulbous battery. The whole point of the iPhone 17 Air is to be the thinnest iPhone ever made, and slapping a battery case on it would sort of defeat the whole point. A more elegant solution would be the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668186/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-review.html\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a>, which could attach magnetically to the back of the phone when needed (<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2616985/the-iphone-16e-is-a-painful-reminder-of-how-great-magsafe-is.html\">assuming it has MagSafe</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So buyers will have two options: deal with poor battery life to have a super-thin iPhone, or attach a battery bulge and disguise the thinness. Or just buy an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17 Pro</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"de1e03ea77805fa0ec75ad8e0a2756000730e3f16e204c51a11fddcaf2b19932","category":"Apple"}
