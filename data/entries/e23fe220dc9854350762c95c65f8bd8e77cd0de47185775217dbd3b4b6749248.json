For both fixes, Apple says on its <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/122282\">security updates page</a> that it is “aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on iOS.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release notes are small for this one.
