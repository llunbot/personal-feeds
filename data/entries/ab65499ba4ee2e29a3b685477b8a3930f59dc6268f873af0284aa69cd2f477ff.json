{"title":"Sonos to Launch $449 Headphones in June to Compete With Apple's AirPods Max","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/sonos-headphones-june-launch/","date":1709057640000,"content":"Sonos, known for its range of speakers and home theater products, is set to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/sonos-new-product-category/\">enter the headphone market</a> in 2024. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/21/sonos-headphones-set-top-box/\">Rumors last year</a> indicated Sonos would release headphones as soon as April 2024, but a new report today from <em>Bloomberg</em> suggests Sonos has delayed the launch due to a software issue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Airpods-Max-Feature-Green-Triad.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe headphones are expected to be available for purchase in the first half of June, with the launch pushed back while the software problem is addressed. Sonos is solving a problem with how the headphones connect to Wi-Fi networks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSonos is aiming to take on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a> with the Sonos headphones, which will have a price tag of $449 and an over-ear design. The headphones will be available in black and white, and are expected to include features like voice control navigation and synchronization with Sonos speakers, soundbars, and subwoofers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's ‌AirPods Max‌ headphones are priced at $549, but third-party retailers often have them available at a discount. Apple has not updated the ‌AirPods Max‌ since their 2020 launch, and they are nearing four years old.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe are expecting a refresh at some point this year, but rumors indicate Apple doesn't have plans for major new features. Instead, the ‌AirPods Max‌ will get a USB-C port, new colors, and little else.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSonos is well-established in the speaker market and is the go-to for those who don't mind an expensive home theater setup, so the Sonos headphones could sell well if Sonos offers high-quality sound and deeper customization than is available with Apple's audio products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSonos CEO Patrick Spence confirmed in November 2023 that Sonos is set to enter a new market, and he said the company's offering would \"delight customers and drive immediate revenue.\" Spence said Sonos will generate more than $100 million from new products in 2024, and that the new device would account for a large portion of the revenue in the second half of 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to headphones, Sonos also plans to unveil a set-top box to rival the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>. That device could come as soon as late 2024. If Sonos sees success with the headphones, earbuds that rival the AirPods could come in the future.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/\">Sonos</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/sonos-headphones-june-launch/\">Sonos to Launch $449 Headphones in June to Compete With Apple's AirPods Max</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-to-launch-449-headphones-in-june-to-compete-with-apples-airpods-max.2420563/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ab65499ba4ee2e29a3b685477b8a3930f59dc6268f873af0284aa69cd2f477ff","category":"Apple"}
