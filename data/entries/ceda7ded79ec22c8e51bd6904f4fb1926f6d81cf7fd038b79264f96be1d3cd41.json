However, Specialized says the flexion approach (as opposed to a damped suspension system) is preferable given it offers significant deflection without markedly compromising saddle height and the relationship between the rider’s sitting position and cranks.</p>\n<p>The system is said to offer “up to 18mm of arcing movement” in opposition to the rear axle, but only compromise saddle height by “1 or 2mm”, according to Roubaix product designer, and suspension expert, Glenn Bennett.</p>\n<p>The seatpost clamp, which Specialized claims is positioned “65mm lower than a traditional seatpost clamp”, is adjustable via an extended Allen bolt, accessible under a rear-positioned cover.</p>\n<h3>Tyre clearance and geometry impact</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n

Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Alongside the ride-damping tech in the frame, Specialized has widened clearance for 40mm-wide tyres (measured).</p>\n<p>Despite the brand claiming the bike is designed primarily for road use, this brings it deep within the grey space between the endurance road and gravel bike genres.</p>\n<p>This has resulted in an average 10mm increase in front-centre measurement compared to the old Roubaix (which had clearance for 33mm-wide tyres).</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the geometry remains focused around slack head tube and seat tube angles, with a taller stack than the Tarmac SL8.</p>\n<div>\n                <table>\n                <colgroup>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n
