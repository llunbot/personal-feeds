Google Cloud, the cloud platform division that competes with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, is following in the footsteps of those companies and rolling out its own Arm-based chip designs. Google says its new \"<span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu\">Google Axion Processors</a>\" are \"custom Arm-based CPUs designed for the data center\" and offer \"industry-leading performance and energy efficiency.\" </span></p>\n<p>Google has been developing custom data center accelerators for things <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/google-brings-45-teraflops-tensor-flow-processors-to-its-compute-cloud/\">like AI</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/youtube-is-now-building-its-own-video-transcoding-chips/\">video transcoding</a>, but this is the first time the company is making a CPU. Google says it's seeing \"<span>50% better performance and up to 60% better energy-efficiency than comparable current-generation x86-based instances.</span>\"</p>\n<p><span>Google's \"Axion\" chip is based on the <a href=\"https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/neoverse/neoverse-v2\">Arm Neoverse V2</a> CPU</span>, so just like the ARM chips we see on mobile devices, by making \"custom\" chips, these companies are closely following a lot of blueprints that Arm makes available. Google says it did include a custom microcontroller called \"Titanium,\" which it says handles <span>networking, security, and storage I/O. </span></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016132#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016132&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"32e44d928db88bf9ac838cd13de9c5c8cf2e3c15240b5656f6bfad5dcbb32c4a","category":"Tech"}
