However, for the same reason, cookies can pose a privacy risk because of the information they hold about you. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/firefox-total-cookie-protection.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nTo combat this, Total Cookie Protection makes sure websites can't track users across websites by patitioning data storage into one cookie jar per website.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith Enhanced Cookie Clearing, when a user empties a cookie jar for an individual website, the entire jar is emptied, including any tracking data set embedded from another website, such as Facebook.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFirefox no longer shows individual domains that store data. Instead, it lists a cookie jar for each website visited, making it easier to identify and remove all data a website has stored locally, while also removing any leftover data from third parties embedded in that site.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/manage-cookies-and-site-data.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFor Enhanced Cookie Clearing to work, Strict Tracking Protection (Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security) needs to be enabled. Enhanced Cookie Clearing will then be used when using \"Clear cookies and site data\" in the identity panel (the lock icon) or in the Firefox preferences.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, there's a new \"Forget About This Site\" option in the History menu that deletes a site from history along with any cookies and caches for it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFirefox 91 is available now from the <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/\">Mozilla website</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/firefox/\">Firefox</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/privacy/\">privacy</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/11/firefox-91-update-enhanced-cookie-protection/\">Firefox 91 Update Strengthens Online Privacy With Enhanced Cookie Protection</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/firefox-91-update-strengthens-online-privacy-with-enhanced-cookie-protection.2307197/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=C_vyWYqQ_DE:EkagTDdO1MM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=C_vyWYqQ_DE:EkagTDdO1MM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/C_vyWYqQ_DE\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a896ca15a07f49b0f4aeed0d7fa2da96ff2196fc093c9a899814cfbe0679654d","category":"Apple"}
