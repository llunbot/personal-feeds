Net profit was up 22% to 3.08 billion yuan.</blockquote>In a stock exchange filing, Luxshare said it had achieved the results despite some of its business being postponed due to \"multiple external factors\" – a reference to the global chip shortage, rising costs of labor and raw materials, and disruptions caused by the global health crisis.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe gains show just how far Luxshare has come since it began its relationship with Apple. In 2013, Luxshare began supplying connectors to Apple before becoming an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> assembler in 2017. It added the Apple Watch to its assembly business in 2019.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis month, Luxshare <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/04/luxshare-precision-enters-iphone-supply-chain/\">reportedly</a> won 3% of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> orders away from Taiwanese rivals Foxconn and Pegatron. Building Apple's premium smartphone is considered to be a major breakthrough for the Chinese company, given that it has never been involved in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> production before. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDespite Luxshare's small percentage of ‌iPhone‌ production this year, its involvement has reportedly rattled rival ‌‌iPhone‌‌ suppliers are said to be wary of the Chinese manufacturer's competitiveness and the possibility that it could steal away bigger chunks of orders in the future. As a mark of its intent, the company last year paid $472 million to acquire a Chinese ‌iPhone‌ facility from smaller assembler Wistron.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple now has more suppliers from China and Hong Kong than from Taiwan, according to <em>Nikkei</em>, and many will have a role in the manufacturing the ‌iPhone 13‌ series, which is expected to enter mass production this week. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is expected to announce the ‌iPhone 13‌ and a new Apple Watch at a digital event next month. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/luxshare/\">Luxshare</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/luxshare-apple-supplier-record-growth/\">Apple Supplier Luxshare Reports Record Growth After Securing iPhone 13 Orders</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-supplier-luxshare-reports-record-growth-after-securing-iphone-13-orders.2308593/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3QxNDoTZ4FI:oXV9irlvK28:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3QxNDoTZ4FI:oXV9irlvK28:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/3QxNDoTZ4FI\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"00cc8584f84c18de9393ca76a407f8996c6650bafe6aea08f2c1bae189df5804","category":"Apple"}
