It looked just like the regular <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/hands-on-with-amazons-brand-new-echo-show-8/\">Echo Show 8</a> smart display/speaker but cost $10 more. Why? Because of its ability to show photos on the home screen for as long as you want—if you signed up for a $2 monthly subscription to Amazon's PhotosPlus. Now, about a year after releasing the Echo Show 8 Photos Edition, Amazon is announcing that it's discontinuing PhotosPlus. That means Echo Show 8 Photos Edition users will be forced to see ads instead of their beloved pics.</p>\n<p>As per <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225149/amazon-end-photosplus-subscription-echo-show-8-photos-edition\">The Verge</a> yesterday, Amazon started sending PhotosPlus subscribers <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@wheelsee/post/C-58LrqSbYW/?xmt=AQGzmRGWYiKIzr_fGPGVQubpJi9x1DpmWUSiz6H0hf9pOA\">emails</a> saying that it will automatically cancel all PhotosPlus subscriptions on September 12 and will stop supporting PhotosPlus as of September 23. PhotosPlus, per Amazon's message, \"makes photos the primary home screen content you see on your Echo Show 8 and includes 25 GB of storage with Amazon Photos,\" <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/amazon-prime/how-to-use-amazon-photos-storage\">Amazon’s online photo storage</a> offering. Users can continue using the 25GB of Amazon Photos storage after September.</p>\n<p>However, users will no longer be able to make photos the indefinite home screen on the Alexa gadget. After September, their devices will no longer have the \"photo-forward mode\" that Amazon advertised for the Echo Show 8 Photos Edition. The photo-forward mode, per Amazon, let people make \"selected personal photos the primary rotating content on the ambient screen\" (photos rotated every 30 seconds). Now, Echo Show 8 Photo Editions will work like a regular Echo Show 8 and default to showing ads and promotions after three hours.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045012#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045012&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"847e058fc3e1c66a7d81ae59b8afd350b13c4b67427c42f2e6dd4e2ca5642076","category":"Tech"}
