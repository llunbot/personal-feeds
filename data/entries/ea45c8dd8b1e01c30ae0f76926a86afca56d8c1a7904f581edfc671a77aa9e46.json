The water came out in an initial burst from the sound, but it is worth noting that the video was only able to remove water from the speaker area.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUV dye stained other areas of the ‌iPhone‌ when it was opened up, so the water wasn't draining from the entire phone. The oscillating tone in the YouTube videos is able to push water out of the speaker grille, but it is not a complete fix for a water-saturated device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/water-speaker-verge-ifixit.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"538\" /><em><div>Water coming out of an ‌iPhone‌'s speaker when a low-toned sound is played, via <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24228925/remove-water-phone-youtube-vergecast\">The Verge and iFixit</a></div></em>\r<br />\nOn the Apple Watch, Apple has a built-in feature that uses sound to expel water from the device, but that is more effective because it is a smaller object with fewer nooks and crannies than an ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's modern iPhones have IP68 water and dust resistance, with the 8 representing water resistance. IPx8 means that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> can withstand splashes, rain, and accidental dunks up to six meters in depth for 30 minutes. ‌iPhone‌ waterproofing does deteriorate over time with wear and tear, and Apple does not cover water damage, so it is best to avoid water exposure when possible.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24228925/remove-water-phone-youtube-vergecast\"><em>The Verge</em>'s full look</a> at how these YouTube videos work is well worth checking out.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/youtube-videos-water-iphone/\">PSA: YouTube Videos Really Can Get Some Water Out of Your iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-youtube-videos-really-can-get-some-water-out-of-your-iphone.2434544/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ea45c8dd8b1e01c30ae0f76926a86afca56d8c1a7904f581edfc671a77aa9e46","category":"Apple"}
