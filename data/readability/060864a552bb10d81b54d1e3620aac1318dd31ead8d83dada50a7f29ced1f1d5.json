That is, unless you’re on a bike.</p><p>Search and State shatters the rules with its high-visibility cycling camo kit, engineered to simultaneously alert other road users to your presence while simultaneously offering the slick style of camouflage. The M-90 High-Viz S2-R comes in short sleeve and long sleeve versions. If it’s as high-tech as the encoded product title and concept seem, you can color us impressed.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17121903/ea0fb2a6-bc6f-f4bb-14c4-506a94b56bbf1.jpg\" alt=\"search and state high-viz jersey\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17121903/ea0fb2a6-bc6f-f4bb-14c4-506a94b56bbf1.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17121903/ea0fb2a6-bc6f-f4bb-14c4-506a94b56bbf1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17121903/ea0fb2a6-bc6f-f4bb-14c4-506a94b56bbf1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17121903/ea0fb2a6-bc6f-f4bb-14c4-506a94b56bbf1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17121903/ea0fb2a6-bc6f-f4bb-14c4-506a94b56bbf1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></p><p>The new release builds on Search and State’s boutique, New York-made pedigree as part of its fall ‘21 collection. The kit dots fluoro orange on top of “rich, saturated geometric” camouflage (can “geometric” things be camouflaged in places that aren’t built by humans?) on a performance build.</p><p>Search and State is psyched on the textile choice, which sounds a lot like a typical poly blend except that it includes high-tech Swiss cooling technology. <a href=\"https://www.schoeller-textiles.com/en/technologies/coldblack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Schoeller’s coldblack</a> absorbs both invisible and visible sunlight, which is a breathy way to say heat and light. Specifically engineered for darker colors, it reduces surface heat on the High-Viz jersey by a claimed 9°F.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17121430/b440b0df-10cf-8b6e-a16c-1da6107120181.jpg\" alt=\"search and state high-viz jersey\" width=\"1199\" height=\"874\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17121430/b440b0df-10cf-8b6e-a16c-1da6107120181.jpg 1199w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17121430/b440b0df-10cf-8b6e-a16c-1da6107120181-297x216.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17121430/b440b0df-10cf-8b6e-a16c-1da6107120181-800x583.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17121430/b440b0df-10cf-8b6e-a16c-1da6107120181-120x87.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17121430/b440b0df-10cf-8b6e-a16c-1da6107120181-768x560.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1199px) 100vw, 1199px\"></p><p>The brand also brags that the shirt is 35+ SPF.
