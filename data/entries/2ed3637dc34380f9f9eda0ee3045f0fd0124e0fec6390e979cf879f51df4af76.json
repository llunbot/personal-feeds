It has been part of their riding since the beginning, a place to breathe and enjoy the landscape and nature on our doorstep. Restrap believes in taking care of what you care about, so they are teaming up with Yorkshire Dales Millennium Trust to support the people, landscape, and wildlife of our closest National Park.</em></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Yorkshire Dales Millennium Trust helps to look after the spectacular Dales landscape, wildlife, and supports rural communities. From tree planting and woodland management, through to rural apprenticeships and connecting more people to nature. The YDMT is a small charity doing big things for the Dales.</p>\n<p>When entering into this partnership, Restrap wanted to support the YDMT financially, but also to roll up our sleeves and physically contribute to taking care of a place they love. <a href=\"http://restrap.com/blogs/news/restrap-and-the-yorkshire-dales-millennium-trust-team-up\" target=\"_blank\">We have already attended one tree-planting day on the banks of the Ribble</a> – under the shadow of the iconic Pen y Ghent – and look forward to teaming up on other projects as we move into spring and summer.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-5.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-5.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-6.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-6.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Celebrating the Dales with YDMT</h3>\n<p>To mark our partnership, Restrap has also launched two new products that celebrate the Yorkshire Dales and the bikepacker’s relationship with them. They commissioned artist, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/itsallrideable/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Hayes</a> to illustrate a custom design.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>RESTRAP X YDMT RACE MUSETTE</h3>\n<p>Rstrap have applied Adam’s print to our ever-popular Race Musette. The basics are still the same – an ultra-lightweight, ultra-packable shoulder bag that is perfect for those moments you need to carry a little more than fits into a jersey pocket.</p>\n<p>Now you can carry a bag of beans and a croissant back from your favourite coffee shop, while professing your love for the Yorkshire Dales, and know that £14 from each sale will be going to a good cause.</p>\n<p>And of course, like all of our bags, the musette is made here in Yorkshire too.</p>\n<p>Price – £30.00</p>\n<p>Only available from <a href=\"https://restrap.com/collections/yorkshire-dales-millennium-trust\" target=\"_blank\">Restrap.</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-4.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Restrap_Millinium_Trust-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>RESTRAP X YDMT PATCH</h3>\n<p>Restrap has taken the same design and turned it into a custom patch. Iron or stitch it onto your favourite frame bag, or wherever you please, and carry a little bit of the Dales with you each time you ride. £4 from each sale goes to YDMT.</p>\n<p>Price – £5</p>\n<p>Only available from <a href=\"https://restrap.com/collections/yorkshire-dales-millennium-trust\" target=\"_blank\">Restrap</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/restrap-announces-partnership-with-yorkshire-dales-millennium-trust-and-two-custom-products\">Restrap Announces Partnership with Yorkshire Dales Millennium Trust and Two Custom Products</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"2ed3637dc34380f9f9eda0ee3045f0fd0124e0fec6390e979cf879f51df4af76","category":"Cycling"}
