Why a flap opening? Well simply put, BXB wants to avoid zippers. Before life as a seamster, Jay documented long-distance bikepacking races like the Silk Road Mountain Race and he frequently saw zippers fail on frame bags in the middle of nowhere.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/UpperHandFrameBag_02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/UpperHandFrameBag_02.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/UpperHandFrameBag_02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/UpperHandFrameBag_02.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>That memory remained as Jay later took to designing his own bags and wanted to offer a frame bag opening that wouldn’t fail mid-tour, something reliable, classic, and functional. Flap opening frame bags are nothing new as they have been around over a hundred years, but BXB has taken steps toward refining that idea; the flap has a plastic insert to keep it fastened securely, the entry hole is lined with a thick trim, and is triple stitched to remain strong when over stuffing, on the non-drive side there’s a separate pocket for small items and the stretch cord closure fastens around a metal hook which can be adjusted and repaired easily.</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There’s four sizes for the Upper Hand framebag; 16″, 17″, 18.5″ and 19.5″ – the size indicates the length.
