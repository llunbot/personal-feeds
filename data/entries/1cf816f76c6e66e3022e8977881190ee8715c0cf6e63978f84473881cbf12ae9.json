And doing so could become much more convenient, requiring nothing more than your phone and an $0.80 piece of plastic, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-34431-1\">new research</a> from the University of California, San Diego.</p>\n<p>The school's device, called BPClip, gives broadly comparable readings to those taken with a traditional cuff but functions as a simple cell phone attachment. It relies on the flashlight and the smartphone’s camera—along with some simple physics.</p>\n<p>BPClip consists of a plastic clip with a spring mechanism that lets the user squeeze the device and two light channels: one to direct a flashlight to your finger and the other to direct the reflected light to the camera for image processing. A custom-made Android app handles the data processing and guides users through the measurement.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948581#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948581&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1cf816f76c6e66e3022e8977881190ee8715c0cf6e63978f84473881cbf12ae9","category":"Tech"}
