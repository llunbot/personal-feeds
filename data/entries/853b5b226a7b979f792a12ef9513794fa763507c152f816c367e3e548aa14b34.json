These wiring deals are sometimes exclusive to one ISP even when the wires are owned by the building owner and not being used.</p>\n<p>The new FCC public notice asks whether the commission should \"revisit its conclusion that exclusive wiring arrangements generally do not preclude access to new entrants and thus do not violate its rules.\" That conclusion was made in 2007 under a Republican majority. The FCC is now asking for public comment on whether exclusive wiring deals \"inhibit entry by competing service providers\" and on whether the deals have any benefits for tenants to outweigh the drawbacks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794460#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794460&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"853b5b226a7b979f792a12ef9513794fa763507c152f816c367e3e548aa14b34","category":"Tech"}
