{"title":"The Size of the US Federal Workforce Has Not Grown in the Last 50 Years","link":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-musk-trump-war-on-federal-employees-doesnt-add-up","date":1741033543000,"content":"\n<p>John Cassidy, writing for The New Yorker (requires a free account to read, annoyingly):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Of course, these calculations can’t be taken literally. Even Musk\nhas said that he wants to protect essential workers. If the entire\nfederal workforce were eliminated, there’d be no one to make sure\nthat federal benefits got paid or that federal taxes were\ncollected. The spending and revenue figures would crater;\nessential services like veterans’ hospitals, air-traffic-control\nsystems, and border-crossing stations would be completely\nabandoned. But this thought experiment does illustrate the point\nthat “bloated” payrolls aren’t what is driving federal spending\nand deficits. Since the nineteen-seventies, as the accompanying\nchart shows, the total number of federal employees has remained\nfairly steady.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/nyer-chart-federal-employees.png\">Here’s a copy of the chart</a>. Cassidy continues:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unlike the figures from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management,\nthe chart, which comes from the Federal Reserve Economic Database,\ncounts members of the U.S. Postal Service as federal employees. It\ndoes show that the federal workforce has grown in recent years,\nbut it’s still no larger than it was thirty or forty years ago.\nDuring the interim, total employment elsewhere in the economy has\ngrown steadily alongside population growth. Consequently, the size\nof the federal workforce relative to the workforce at large has\nfallen considerably, as the following chart shows.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/nyer-chart-federal-workforce-proportion.png\">Here’s a copy of that second chart</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I knew the supposed justifications for the whole DOGE endeavor were a sham, but until this piece I was under the incorrect assumption that the federal government workforce has been growing steadily for decades, at least keeping pace with its percentage of the overall US workforce. The opposite is true — because the federal workforce size has remained steady while the population has continued to grow, its share of the overall workforce has in fact shrunk considerably.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/03/the-size-of-the-us-federal-workforce-has-not-grown-in-the-last-50-years\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f7ef5802850b188fb6ed0c8264b4bf97c49d8bb6876d0b3bb4798f1d8d2de99e","category":"Tech"}
