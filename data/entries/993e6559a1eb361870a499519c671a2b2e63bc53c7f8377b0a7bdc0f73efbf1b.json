The special mode conserves what remaining battery life the device has left by limiting some features, but by default the mode automatically turns off when a charging iPhone or iPad reaches 80% percent. If that irks you, don't worry – there is a solution.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPerhaps you're running the latest version of iOS or iPadOS on an older device and you've found that the battery life is inadequate to get you through the day. Or maybe you just want to reduce the amount of times you have to charge your iPhone or iPad. Either way, you can keep Low Power Mode enabled regardless of the battery level with the help of an automation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone/iPad Features Disabled by Low Power Mode</h2>\r<br />\nBefore you follow the steps in this article to create the automation, it's worth highlighting which of the features it disables to reduce your device's power consumption. <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205234\">According to Apple</a>, Low Power Mode turns off the following:\r<br />\n<ul><li>5G (except for video streaming) on iPhone 12 models</li>\r<br />\n<li>Auto-Lock (defaults to 30 seconds) </li>\r<br />\n<li>Display brightness </li>\r<br />\n<li>Display refresh rate (limited up to 60 Hz) on iPhone and iPad models with ProMotion display </li>\r<br />\n<li>Some visual effects </li>\r<br />\n<li>iCloud Photos (temporarily paused) </li>\r<br />\n<li>Automatic downloads </li>\r<br />\n<li>Email fetch </li>\r<br />\n<li>Background app refresh </li></ul>If you're happy to live without the above features for as long as Low Power Mode is on, follow the steps below to create your automation. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Creating an Always-On Low Power Mode Automation</h2>\r<br />\n<ol><li>Launch the <strong>Shortcuts</strong> app on your iPhone, then tap the <strong>Automation</strong> tab at the bottom.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button in the top right, then select <strong>Create Personal Automation</strong>.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/stop-iphone-low-power-mode-turning-off4.jpg\" alt=\"shortcuts\" width=\"2738\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>Scroll down and choose <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Deselect the <strong>Is Turned On</strong> option and select the <strong>Is Turned Off</strong> option instead, then tap <strong>Next</strong>.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/stop-iphone-low-power-mode-turning-off3.jpg\" alt=\"shortcuts\" width=\"2738\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>Tap <strong>Add Action</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap inside the search field and search for the <strong>Set Low Power Mode</strong> script, then select it below.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/stop-iphone-low-power-mode-turning-off2.jpg\" alt=\"shortcuts\" width=\"2738\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>Make sure the <strong>Turn</strong> and <strong>On</strong> options in blue are selected, then tap <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Toggle off the switch next to <strong>Ask Before Running</strong>, then tap <strong>Don't Ask</strong> in the prompt to confirm.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/stop-iphone-low-power-mode-turning-off1.jpg\" alt=\"shortcuts\" width=\"2738\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>Tap <strong>Done</strong> to finish.</li></ol>Low Power Mode can be turned on and off manually at any time by going to <strong>Settings -&gt; Battery</strong> and toggling on the switch next to <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>.
