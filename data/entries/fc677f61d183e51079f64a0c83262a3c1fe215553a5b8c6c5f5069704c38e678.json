Content\nmoderation at scale <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=content+moderation+at+scale\">is impossible to do well</a>. Importantly,\nthis is <em>not</em> an argument that we should throw up our hands and do\nnothing. Nor is it an argument that companies can’t do <em>better\njobs</em> within their own content moderation efforts. But I do think\nthere’s a huge problem in that many people — including many\npoliticians and journalists — seem to expect that these companies\nnot only can, but should, strive for a level of content moderation\nthat is simply impossible to reach.</p>\n\n<p>And thus, throwing humility to the wind, I’d like to propose\nMasnick’s Impossibility Theorem, as a sort of play on Arrow’s\nImpossibility Theorem. <em>Content moderation at scale is impossible\nto do well</em>. More specifically, it will always end up frustrating\nvery large segments of the population and will always fail to\naccurately represent the “proper” level of moderation of anyone.\nWhile I’m not going to go through the process of formalizing the\ntheorem, a la Arrow’s, I’ll just note a few points on why the\nargument I’m making is inevitably true.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/21/masnick-impossibility-theorem\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"fc677f61d183e51079f64a0c83262a3c1fe215553a5b8c6c5f5069704c38e678","category":"Tech"}
