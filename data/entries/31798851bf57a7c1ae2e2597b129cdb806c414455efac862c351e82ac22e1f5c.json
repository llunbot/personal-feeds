The latest launch date for a NASA mission to survey the sky and better understand the early evolution of the Universe comes Monday night. The launch window for this SPHEREx mission opened on February 28, but a series of problems with integrating the rocket and payloads have delayed the mission nearly two weeks.</p>\n<p>Then there are the Falcon 9 first stage issues. Last week, a Falcon 9 rocket launched nearly two dozen Starlink satellites into low-Earth orbit. However, one of the rocket's nine engines suffered a fuel leak during ascent. Due to a lack of oxygen in the thinning atmosphere, the fuel leak did not preclude the satellites from reaching orbit. But when the first stage returned to Earth, it caught fire after landing on a droneship, toppling over. This followed a similar issue in August, when there was a fire in the engine compartment. After nearly three years without a Falcon 9 landing failure, SpaceX had two in six months.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/after-years-of-acceleration-has-spacex-finally-reached-its-speed-limit/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/after-years-of-acceleration-has-spacex-finally-reached-its-speed-limit/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"31798851bf57a7c1ae2e2597b129cdb806c414455efac862c351e82ac22e1f5c","category":"Tech"}
