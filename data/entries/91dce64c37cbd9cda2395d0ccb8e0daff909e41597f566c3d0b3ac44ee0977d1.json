While the new thermal design is greatly improved, the efficiency of the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Pro and ‌M1‌ Max chips mean that for most customers, the \"fans never turn on\" for tasks done daily, according to Apple. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's senior vice president of hardware engineering, John Ternus, touted during this week Apple's event that the new chassis was designed with an \"intense focus on performance and utility.\" The new MacBook Pros are \"precisely machined around an advanced thermal system,\" he added. All in all, the new thermal architecture allows the new MacBook Pros to maintain high performance over more extended periods, without overheating or requiring the fans to turn on at higher speeds. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, both configurable with the ‌M1‌ Pro or ‌M1‌ Max chips, are currently available for pre-order and will begin shipping to customers next week.
