The new ‌Mac mini‌ will apparently approach the size of an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, but it may be slightly taller than the current model, which is 1.4 inches high. It will continue to feature an aluminum shell. Individuals working on the new device apparently say that it is \"essentially an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> in a small box.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is said to have tested ‌Mac mini‌ models with at least three USB-C ports on the back, as well as an area for the power cable and an HDMI port. There will continue to be two versions of the ‌Mac mini‌: one with the standard M4 chip, similar to the ‌iPad Pro‌, and one with an M4 Pro chip. The base model is set to begin shipping from suppliers this month ahead of release later in the year, while the high-end model will not be ready until October.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe M4 generation of Apple silicon will purportedly be the first time that Apple has used the same chip generation across all of its Macs, with refreshes to add the M4 chip to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, MacBook Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a> planned to take place over the next year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/\">M4 Mac mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/mac-mini-to-become-smallest-ever-apple-computer/\">M4 Mac Mini to Become Apple's Smallest Ever Computer With Complete Redesign</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-mac-mini-to-become-apples-smallest-ever-computer-with-complete-redesign.2433207/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"776598784cc98357591ae110343930fbe20a76cc333a6fb988e733f4128e7b73","category":"Apple"}
