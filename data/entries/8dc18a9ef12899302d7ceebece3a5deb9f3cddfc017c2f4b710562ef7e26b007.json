In compliance with the Digital Markets Act, iPhones running iOS 17.4 and later now allow third-party app stores and browser engines, have new policies and terms for App Store apps, and a whole lot more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 17.5 isn’t nearly as monumental, but it still brings a few new features that users here and in the EU will appreciate. And it might be the last one we get for a while—with iOS 18 coming at WWDC in just a few weeks Apple’s iOS 17 development is likely to slow down a bit. Here’s everything you need to know about iOS 17.5:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17.5 New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most notable new feature is once again for the EU, Apple now allows users to download apps from a developer’s website instead of just an App Store. However, there are also some new features for U.S. users. In partnership with Google, Apple has finally introduced cross-platform tracking detection that will deliver notifications to users if a compatible Bluetooth tracker (AirTag and third-party devices) they do not own is moving with them, regardless of what operating system the device is paired with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to send a broken iPhone to the Apple Store, a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2321992/ios-17-5-beta-repair-state-find-my-activation-lock.html\">Repair State mode</a> will let you keep Find My and Activation Lock enabled but still allow technicians access your phone. The update also includes new Pride month wallpapers in five different color schemes. Additionally, there are some new features for Apple News+ subscribers:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Offline mode in Apple News+ gives you access to the Today feed and News+ tab, even when you don’t have an internet connection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quartiles is a new and original daily word game that is now available in Apple News+</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scoreboard in News+ Puzzles gives you access to new player data for Crossword, Mini Crossword and Quartiles, including stats and streaks</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17.5 security updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are more than a dozen security updates in iOS 17.5 that include important fixes to AppleAVD (the audio and video decoder), FindMy, Maps, and Notes, along with two critical patches that could lead to arbitrary code execution:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kernel</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Impact: An attacker may be able to cause unexpected app termination or arbitrary code execution</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Description: The issue was addressed with improved memory handling.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WebKit</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Impact: An attacker with arbitrary read and write capability may be able to bypass Pointer Authentication</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about each of these, check out Apple’s page about the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214101&amp;xcust=1-1-2262753-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">security content of iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5</a>. Suffice it to say there are quite a lot of fixes to multiple apps and frameworks—a lot of “surface area” as they say—so updating your iPhone and iPad as soon as possible is recommended.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17.5: How to install </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You will probably be prompted to install iOS 17.5 eventually, but that can take days or even weeks. If you want to update right away, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Setting.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>General</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>Software Update</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’ll see the update appear, tap <em>Download and Install</em> (or <em>Install Now</em> if your iPhone has already downloaded it)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’ll need to enter your passcode and your iPhone will restart after the update downloads and installs</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out everything you need to know about iOS 17 in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17 superguide</a>.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8dc18a9ef12899302d7ceebece3a5deb9f3cddfc017c2f4b710562ef7e26b007","category":"Apple"}
