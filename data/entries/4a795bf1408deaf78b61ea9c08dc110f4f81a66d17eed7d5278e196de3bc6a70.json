Here's Your October Rumor Update","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/06/will-apple-release-new-ipads-this-year/","date":1696588980000,"content":"Apple sometimes releases new iPads in the fall, but a question mark remains over whether that will happen in 2023. We're now into October, and if Apple plans to release iPads before the holidays, this is the month it will most likely happen. Here's what we know so far.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/03/ipad-fall-2022-lineup.jpg\" alt width=\"960\" height=\"512\" />\r<br />\nIt's been almost a year since Apple released a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, the last being the two refreshed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models and the latest low-cost ‌iPad‌, all released in October 2022. Going on recent tradition, new models are now long overdue. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you look at the last decade, Apple sometimes holds an annual fall event in which it launches new Macs and iPads. While that did not happen last year, there were October events in 2013, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2021.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> recently told <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> hosts that he <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/gurman-october-apple-event-unlikely/\">does not</a> expect Apple to hold an October event because the company does not have enough new products and features to justify it. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, that doesn't mean we won't be seeing new iPads from Apple this year. Apple could choose to release new models via press release instead, like it did in January 2023 for the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models and the second-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>. At the same time, Apple may not have any new models forthcoming this side of Christmas 2023. So what do the rumors say?\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Rumors For 2023 iPads</h2>\r<br />\nIn an article discussing stagnating global tablet demand in the second half of 2023, Taiwan-based <em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/apple-ipad-mini-7-release-late-2023/\">said</a> investors expected an uptick in Apple's share of the tablet market owing to orders for a \"small-size\" ‌iPad‌ in the fourth quarter. Additionally, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s ‌Mark Gurman‌ earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/08/airpods-apple-watch-ipad-apple-tv-2023/\">reported</a> that an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> update with a minor \"spec bump\" is not out of the question. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn August, the leaker known as \"ShrimpApplePro\" also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/ipad-mini-7-could-be-coming-later-this-year/\">suggested</a> a seventh-generation ‌iPad mini‌ was in the works at Apple, and said that they had seen evidence that at least one new ‌iPad‌ model is coming this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/10th-Gen-iPad-Feature-Fanned-Pink.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nAccording to a recent report from <em>9to5Mac</em>, Apple is working on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-two-ipad-air-models/\">two new versions of the iPad Air 6</a>. The site claims that Apple has four separate models in the works (two each in cellular and Wi-Fi).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple makes two versions of the ‌iPad Pro‌ because it comes in two sizes, and <em>9to5Mac</em> speculates that Apple could release a larger version of the ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>‌ to go along with the current 10.9-inch version, or debut \"a more expensive model with better specs.\" The outlet says that its sources believe the ‌‌iPad mini‌‌ 7 is coming \"soon,\" but the report also says that all of the new iPads are on track to be announced \"between now and WWDC 2024 in June,\" which is a wide window.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple last updated the ‌iPad Air‌ in March 2022 with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip. If the ‌iPad Air‌ were to be updated with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip one year after the ‌iPad Pro‌, that would point to an October 2023 launch. However, a later launch in 2024 is possible.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's worth noting that Apple has updated the entry-level ‌iPad‌ on an annual basis since 2017, so there will either be an 11th-generation ‌iPad‌ released later this year, or Apple will break a six-year tradition. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Rumors Against 2023 iPads</h2>\r<br />\nApple during its August earnings call warned that ‌‌iPad‌‌ revenue is expected to drop double digits, suggesting it does not expect to have products to entice customers during the holiday quarter beyond the recently launched <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> series and new Apple Watch models. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPad-mini-AND-Air-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThat is in line with some rumors, which indicate major new ‌‌iPad‌‌ launches are not expected until 2024. In January, established Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said the next ‌iPad mini‌ would likely enter mass production in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/30/new-ipad-mini-launching-next-year/\">first quarter of 2024</a>. More recently, Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/\">said</a> he does not expect any new ‌iPad‌ models this year. Likewise, multiple rumors suggest ‌iPad Pro‌‌ models with OLED displays and M3 chips won't be coming until 2024. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne other thing to consider is the introduction of Apple's Vision Pro headset. According to Apple, the Vision Pro will go on sale in early 2024, which likely means January to late April. Note that the Vision Pro uses an ‌M2‌ chip. If Apple's $3,500 headset launched with a processor that is inferior to those already powering ‌iPad Pro‌ models, that may seem strange to the average consumer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Summing Up</h2>\r<br />\nSumming up, we could see at least one ‌iPad‌ unveiled in October, perhaps an ‌iPad mini‌, an ‌iPad Air‌, or an 11th-generation low-cost ‌‌iPad‌‌, but these will be minor refreshes. It would be reasonable for at least one or two of these models to be updated in October 2023, but 2024 launches cannot be ruled out.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/06/will-apple-release-new-ipads-this-year/\">Will Apple Unveil New iPads in 2023?
