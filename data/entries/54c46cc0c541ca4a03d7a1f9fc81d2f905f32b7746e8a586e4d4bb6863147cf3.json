{"title":"Looking Back on Apple’s Acquisition of P.A. Semi","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/190332/pasemi.html","date":1635874009000,"content":"\n<p>Rik Myslewski, writing for Macworld back in 2008:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple’s purchase of a microprocessor design firm has triggered a\nwave of speculation over what the computer maker plans to do with\nits newly acquired assets. Perhaps, the thinking goes, the\npurchase means a new chip to power future iPhone models. Or maybe\nit will push Apple into new areas of portable computing. It might\neven mean a return of sorts to the company’s PowerPC days.</p>\n\n<p>But after a closer look at the deal, the answer could be — and\nprobably is — none of the above.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ll admit that sometimes I post old articles to make hay out of someone’s shortsightedness. Here, though, I remember <em>agreeing</em> with Myslewski. I thought the P.A. Semi acquisition was about talent, not specific silicon I.P. — and I could not have been more wrong. The idea — in 2008 — that this acquisition would take Apple to where it is today was just unimaginable. If Myslewski had written back then that he expected Apple to — in just over a decade — design chips that were both faster and far more power-efficient than Intel’s, we’d have thought he was nuts.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/02/pa-semi-looking-back\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"54c46cc0c541ca4a03d7a1f9fc81d2f905f32b7746e8a586e4d4bb6863147cf3","category":"Tech"}
