The new packs feature plenty of upgrades and revisions making it easier to organize your gear, carry tools or quickly access your camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trail Builder 35:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-front.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-front-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"EVOC Trail Builder 35 pack, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-front-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-front-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-front-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-front-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-front-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-front.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trail Builder 35 is an updated version of the existing Trail Builder pack. Here’s one cool thing about how this pack was designed; we’re all familiar with pro riders contributing to R+D for bikes and components, but EVOC worked with several well-known trail builders to improve upon their tool-hauling pack. Input from testing with Ryan Berrecloth, Digger, Tom Pro, and Scott Veach helped refine this pack into its new form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated pack is now made of a more durable Cordura fabric. It features a large pouch designed to carry a chainsaw, straps to carry pick axes or shovels, and a roll at the bottom intended to carry rock-breaking nails. EVOC also added a second side pocket, where the previous Trail Builder pack had one.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-chest-strap-adjustment.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-chest-strap-adjustment-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"EVOC Trail Builder 35 pack, chest strap adjustment\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-chest-strap-adjustment-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-chest-strap-adjustment-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-chest-strap-adjustment-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-chest-strap-adjustment-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-chest-strap-adjustment-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-Trail-Builder-35-pack-chest-strap-adjustment.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new pack also features EVOC’s latest chest strap adjustment, which replaces the previous sliding buckles. The builders found the buckles could slide on their own, so EVOC went with a metal buckle that hooks onto whatever loop fits best, eliminating any chance of the strap moving around. For the waist strap, EVOC employs a solid metal buckle that won’t loosen up. This pack does not carry a water bladder, as EVOC says trail builders tend to sick with water bottles instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but certainly not least, as seen in the title photo, the pack comes with a special orange rain cover with ‘trail builder at work’ written across it so builders can warn riders to slow down and proceed carefully as work is in progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>CP 26:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP26-photo-pack.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1035\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP26-photo-pack-800x1035.jpg\" alt=\"EVOC CP26 photo pack, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP26-photo-pack-800x1035.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP26-photo-pack-232x300.jpg 232w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP26-photo-pack-93x120.jpg 93w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP26-photo-pack-768x994.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP26-photo-pack-1187x1536.jpg 1187w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP26-photo-pack.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The CP 26 photo pack has been updated, now offering quicker and easier access to your camera gear. New openings provide access to your camera from the side, and you can now open the top cargo area from the front so you can skip opening the main compartment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-new-Velcro-dividers.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-new-Velcro-dividers-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"EVOC updated Velcro dividers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-new-Velcro-dividers-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-new-Velcro-dividers-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-new-Velcro-dividers-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-new-Velcro-dividers-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-new-Velcro-dividers-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-new-Velcro-dividers.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A few other improvements were made as well: EVOC has made stronger Velcro dividers with plastic end pieces so they stay in place better than the less rigid outgoing type. They’ve also upgraded this pack with the same hook-in chest strap adjusters as the Trail Builder 35 shows above, and the CP 26’s waist strap is removable. The back padding has also been improved to offer better ventilation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP-26-photo-pack-bladder-pocket.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1138\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP-26-photo-pack-bladder-pocket-800x1138.jpg\" alt=\"EVOC CP26 photo pack, water bladder pocket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP-26-photo-pack-bladder-pocket-800x1138.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP-26-photo-pack-bladder-pocket-211x300.jpg 211w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP-26-photo-pack-bladder-pocket-84x120.jpg 84w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP-26-photo-pack-bladder-pocket-768x1092.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP-26-photo-pack-bladder-pocket-1080x1536.jpg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP-26-photo-pack-bladder-pocket.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>EVOC equipped this pack with a side pocket for a water bladder, keeping it completely separate from your camera gear in case the bladder leaks or gets punctured.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>CP 40:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP40-photo-drone-pack.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"966\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP40-photo-drone-pack-800x966.jpg\" alt=\"EVOC CP40 photo/drone pack, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP40-photo-drone-pack-800x966.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP40-photo-drone-pack-248x300.jpg 248w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP40-photo-drone-pack-99x120.jpg 99w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP40-photo-drone-pack-768x927.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP40-photo-drone-pack.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-new CP 40 is EVOC’s biggest photo pack, and the large compartment inside was designed to carry either RED cameras or drones. The straps on the outside can carry tripods, and a top handle makes it easy to move around during photo shoots. This pack shares many features with the CP 26, like a removable waist belt and a separate water bladder pocket to keep your pricey camera gear safe and dry. A rain cover is also included for extra nasty weather protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP40-photo-drone-pack-interior.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"537\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP40-photo-drone-pack-interior-800x537.jpg\" alt=\"EVOC CP40 Photo/drone pack, inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP40-photo-drone-pack-interior-800x537.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP40-photo-drone-pack-interior-297x199.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP40-photo-drone-pack-interior-120x81.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP40-photo-drone-pack-interior-768x515.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EVOC-CP40-photo-drone-pack-interior.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside we can see the CP 40 gets EVOC’s stronger updated Velcro dividers and quite a few pockets for organizing your gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These new packs aren’t yet showing on EVOC’s website, but keep an eye on their site for updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://evocsports.us/\">evocsports.us</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/evoc-camera-pack-for-drones-red-cameras-trail-builder-bag/\">EVOC’s New Camera Pack is Designed for Drones &amp; RED Cameras + Updated Trail Builder Bag</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"2b297d9f2f92e2fa889bc3d010602aece47644942daa2255fd1ee6ad95a7392c","category":"Cycling"}
