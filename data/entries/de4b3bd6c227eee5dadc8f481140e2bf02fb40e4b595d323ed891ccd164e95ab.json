The newly announced 2021 MacBook Pro models include an SD card slot and an HDMI port alongside three Thunderbolt ports. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/2021-MBP-Profile-Feature-Yellow.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs noted in Apple's technical specifications for the new machine, the HDMI port is unfortunately not top of the line -- it is an HDMI 2.0 port instead of an HDMI 2.1 port. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe HDMI 2.0 port supports a single 4K display with a resolution of up to 60Hz. HDMI 2.1 technology would have allowed the port to run a 4K display with a 120Hz refresh rate. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's curious that Apple did not include HDMI 2.1 in the MacBook Pro models because the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> 4K that was released earlier this year <em>does</em> have an HDMI 2.1 port. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>HDMI port is only HDMI 2.0, exactly why I’d much rather have had another T4 port, what a waste. <a href=\"https://t.co/zzUXwfGoO8\">pic.twitter.com/zzUXwfGoO8</a></p>— Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1450166030446235650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 18, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nWith the Thunderbolt 4 ports, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Pro MacBook Pro models overall support up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz.
