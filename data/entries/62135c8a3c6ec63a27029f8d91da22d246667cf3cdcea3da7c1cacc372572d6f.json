The session will explore the elements of great apps with an Apple engineer, provide tips from a former Challenge winner, and offer inspiration for app playgrounds. Apple has also updated Develop in Swift Tutorials to help students learn the foundations of coding.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said it will select 350 winners based on \"innovation, creativity, social impact, or inclusivity.\" 50 of the winners will be invited to spend three days at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/\">Apple Park</a> in Cupertino, California this summer. The trip generally coincides with Apple's annual WWDC event, which is often held in June.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBack in October, Apple gave students a heads up that the Swift Student Challenge would take place in February, but exact dates weren't provided at the time.
