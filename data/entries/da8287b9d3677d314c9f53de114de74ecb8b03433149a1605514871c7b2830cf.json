The groupset launched in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/campagnolo-super-record-wireless-groupset/\">May this year</a> and promised new ergonomics and shifting logic but saw the Italian manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/the-death-of-campagnolos-thumb-shifter/\">drop its defining thumb shifter</a>.</p>\n<p>To match the groupset, the bike has Campagnolo’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/campagnolo-hyperon-ultra-wheelset/\">Hyperon Ultra wheels</a>. These road bike wheels are claimed to weigh 1,240g for the pair which Specialized says makes them the perfect match for the Aethos’ climbing ability.</p>\n<p>The wheels were launched two months before the new Super Record Wireless groupset, resurrecting the Hyperon name, which had disappeared from Campagnolo’s lineup.</p>\n<h2>“Hand-dipped paintjob”</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Aethos with Campagnolo Super Record Wireless.\" title=\"Specialized_MY23_AETHOS_LTD_CAMPY_COCKPIT-3-4(MedRes)\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike has a marmoreal finish.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>One of the most striking features of this Specialized S-Works Aethos – beyond its top-spec, Italian componentry – is the frame’s paintwork.</p>\n<p>Specialized says the frame has a “hand-dipped paintjob” giving the bike a marmoreal finish.
