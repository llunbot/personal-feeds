She has come to this year’s Tour with the primary goal of helping her SD Worx team leader Demi Vollering win the yellow jersey. One day ago, on Stage 7, Reusser played the role of diesel locomotive, hauling Vollering towards solo stage leader Katarzyna Niewiadoma and helping to slingshot her onto the steep pitches of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-tour-de-france-climbs-col-du-tourmalet\" target=\"_blank\">Col du Tourmalet</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vollering then passed Niewiadoma in the fog to win the stage and establish a virtually insurmountable 1min 58sec lead in the general classification. Barring a crash or meltdown during the Stage 8 time-trial, it seems inevitable that SD Worx will leave the Tour with the yellow jersey. Reusser, a time-trial specialist, now has a chance to pursue individual glory.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/zoe-backstedt-cyclist\">‘There was never pressure to be in cycling, it was just what I wanted to do’: Zoe Bäckstedt interview</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/2023-tour-de-france-femmes-review\">The 2023 Tour de France Femmes review: SD Worx domination, Annemiek van Vleuten’s farewell, Fenix-Deceuninck’s attacking and start to finish stage coverage please</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2023\">The best photos from the Tour de France Femmes 2023</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>But despite being one of the favourites to win the stage, she isn’t filled with anticipation. She certainly isn’t worried; she is familiar with the roads here, having surveyed the course in the late spring. She also rode a lap earlier this morning and knows she isn’t hindered by any nagging pains. And yet the countdown towards her start time feels ominous. Two hours… one hour… ten minutes. She is struggling to find the passion that usually empowers her to compete. She would like to stop the countdown if she could.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As soon as the countdown is done and we are at zero it’s about meeting your inner self and having a hard time on the bike,’ Reusser says. ‘And if you are not in the mood, time can go slower.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She doesn’t worry about particular risks, but she does think time-trials present a unique conundrum for cyclists. ‘A time-trial puts forward a lot of philosophical questions. Why do we like to hurt ourselves?’ she asks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s for this reason that Reusser prefers technical courses to long, straight ones: ‘They don’t give you so much space to be with yourself and be in your thoughts and be suffering.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Marlen Reusser\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-02-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-02-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-02-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-02-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Joan Minder/13Photo</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>When she hears the final beeps of the countdown, she pushes on her pedals and surges onto the course. She knows she is strong enough. She knows she has done the preparation. Now she just needs to pedal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Just go full gas,’ she tells herself as the speed builds. ‘Just go to the finish line.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Late bloomer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up in Switzerland, Reusser learned to ride a bike when she was young. She started pedalling when she was just four years old and used her bike for the 2km commute to school, but she didn’t start riding her bike to explore local roads and trails until she was in her early twenties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike other pro cyclists who are groomed through the junior ranks, honing their craft and competing for national championships in their late teens, Reusser didn’t start riding competitively until she was in her mid-twenties. She completed a university degree in medicine and also studied sports nutrition. Her first major event was the Swiss National Road Championships in 2017, aged 25. She joined the pro peloton two years later aged 27, and only now, at the relatively advanced age of 31, is she finally testing the limit of what her ceiling might be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusser’s 2023 race season has been her best yet, marked with a series of personal achievements, but also, she says, by rising levels of mental fatigue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In March, she won Gent-Wevelgem on a brutal, rain-soaked day, pushing off alone in a daring solo attack 40km from the finish line of the 162km course, finishing two minutes ahead of the peloton. In May she won the Itzulia Women’s stage race in Spain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her highpoint came in June at the Tour de Suisse. Ecstatic after logging a GC victory in her home country, she said, ‘I am so happy. You see my smile? I have muscle pain from smiling.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusser’s successes this year have been a continuation of the results she enjoyed in 2022, when she won on the gravel roads of Stage 4 of the Tour de France Femmes in a solo breakaway, as well as the European Championships Time-Trial. And as her career highlights illustrate, she tends to win in solo attacks or time-trials. For Reusser, these individual tests are an opportunity to explore the limits of body and mind.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Marlen Reusser\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Joan Minder/13Photo</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The nicest scenario is if you can do your best, as perfect as you can, get to your limit and pace it well, give it your personal max that day. That’s what makes me proud. Even if I don’t win, I’m happy,’ she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Competing and winning is what drives Reusser, but it comes at a price. She says she is feeling psychologically depleted. ‘We work so hard. We dedicate so much to achieving our goals. I won the Tour de Suisse and have had such a good season. Then there is the moment for taking a break.’ But this season the relentlessness of the racing calendar has meant that respite from competition has never come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It just went on and on and on. People need to cherish what they did and to relax. Nobody can go high, high, high. It’s hard, you travel a lot, it’s boom-boom. We live such an intense life,’ she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Time on the mind</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During the first few kilometres of the Stage 8 time-trial, Reusser benefits from the downhill slope of the course. She won’t make the mistake of over-extending herself in the early minutes of the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You’re not going to blow up,’ she tells herself. ‘You can do it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusser rides by feel during time-trials. She doesn’t want to see her power output, average watts or heart rate. She has developed an ability to gauge her own effort in a way that allows her to ride at the limit of a sustainable pace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’m convinced if you want to go full gas, you’ve got to go by feeling,’ she says. ‘It’s the eighth day of a hard stage race. It’s hot. You cannot predict what your ideal power output is at a certain moment.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arriving at the first climb, she keeps her elbows tucked in and her hands folded over the aero bars, almost in a praying position. Now is the time to push.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Hurt yourself,’ she thinks. She keeps her cadence high, spinning the pedals. ‘At least try. Do something. Even if you are not motivated,’ she tells herself. She attacks the climb, willing herself to embrace the pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s a very, very special state of mind and body. You are in a kind of hypnosis. You don’t really feel, your mind is strange, your body hurts,’ she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the top, she barely has a chance to recover before she finds herself impeded by a TV motorcycle and a team car. She knows she is losing seconds, potentially wasting the work she put in on the climb. The car finally pulls to the side and she breaks from her aero position to flash a hand sign, signalling her frustration. It’s an unexpected annoyance, a needless distraction from her race plan. ‘I lost time there,’ she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But she also knows she has slower riders in front of her. She can use the other riders on the course for extra motivation. She pushes onward, looking to bridge the gap and overtake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I could pass three or four girls along the course,’ she says. It’s a game within the solitary endurance test, a welcome distraction. ‘It’s nice if you see somebody. It’s an advantage if you can pass. I love it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the finish line, Reusser bares her teeth in a slight grimace, breathing heavily with her mouth open. She doesn’t feel like a valiant conqueror crossing the line. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘There was relief that it was done. I didn’t care too much if I had won it or not. I did it. I was happy I was done.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Marlen Reusser\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Joan Minder/13Photo</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As she settles into the race leader’s seat to watch the rest of the competition unfold, Reusser finally starts to enjoy the moment. She came to the Tour as a support rider rather than to focus on maximising her own position in the general classification, and as such is well down overall by this point. With the higher-placed riders all still to finish, Reusser now has the chance to observe and appreciate the rest of the race. The TV cameras catch her with a slight grin on her face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When she looks back on that time in the race leader’s chair, she says, ‘It was interesting to see who was going fast. I started to hope that nobody was faster. I enjoyed it. I’m almost never in the hot seat as I’m almost always one of the last to start. This was nice,’ she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was proud I just did it. I was happy,’ she adds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Work, rest and play</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusser may underplay how much competing in time-trials means to her, but there is no disputing that she holds herself to exacting standards. Even when she thinks back to what she considers to be the best time-trial performance of her career – Stage 2 of the 2021 Simac Ladies Tour, a time-trial on flat, winding roads in the Netherlands – she knows she could have cornered better and ridden faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, she isn’t fully satisfied with her performance here on the roads around Pau. She says she rode hard on the final climb, but over the final metres knew she could have pushed harder. She held back from reaching her full limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Reusser is not a machine. She is fully aware that her demanding approach to training, diet, preparation and racing has helped her garner some notable results, but that by this point it has also led her to the verge of cumulative mental exhaustion. She knows she needs a rest and is already thinking of what she needs to do to bounce back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’m not sure what I should think about this off-season. Do you need a physical reset, a mental reset? If you just need a mental reset, can you still ride the bike if you love it? Or do you need rest physically? I don’t know. I really don’t know,’ she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What she does know is that she is looking forward to having some time away from competing in late 2023, which she intends to use to focus on making sure her competitive schedule is more sustainable. She needs to find better ways to rebound and recover from training and competing. Later this year, she says, she might join her boyfriend for some fun and unstructured gravel riding or bikepacking trips.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-05-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Marlen Reusser\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-05-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-05-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-05-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-05-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-05-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/marlen-reusser-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Joan Minder/13Photo</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Even after the biggest events, when I come home I feel free to just ride my bike as I want to. It’s not in my schedule. I love it. To ride my bike as an off-season activity is something I could really imagine doing,’ she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Reusser, the bike is both the cause of her mental pressure and also the release valve.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The victory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The last rider out on the course is Demi Vollering. Reusser watches from the hot seat. She is confident but also has a seed of doubt – she knows she held back during the last few metres, after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vollering’s time is good. She surges towards the finish line as the clock ticks past 29 minutes, giving it everything, but it’s soon apparent that her effort isn’t enough. She hits 29:15, Reusser’s time, and still has to keep fighting towards the finish line. She finishes in 29:25, good enough for second place on the stage, and collapses into a seated position on the ground. It’s a lot for Reusser to process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusser knows she helped Vollering fight for and hold onto the race leader’s yellow jersey. She assisted SD Worx in achieving their collective team goals for the Tour. She now knows that she will be rewarded for her efforts with an individual stage victory in the first ever Tour de France Femmes time-trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her press conference after the stage, Reusser says, ‘I’m quite tired. I’m really happy for this result. I targeted this time-trial. I’m happy that I managed to win here.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being mentally and physically exhausted, Reusser is already thinking of how she can fine-tune her vegetarian diet and focus on getting leaner in order to maximise her performances in 2024. She’s looking forward to competing in the time-trials at the Olympics in Paris next year, not to mention the UCI World Championships on home soil in Zurich, Switzerland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusser will be 32 by the time she lines up for those races, but she is confident that she still hasn’t reached the peak of her ability or the prime of her career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We are going to put even more focus on time-trialling,’ she says. ‘Let’s see.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Race against time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The career highlights of Marlen Reusser</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2017</strong><strong><br /></strong>1st, individual time-trial (ITT), Swiss National Championships</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2019</strong><strong><br /></strong>1st, ITT and road race, Swiss National Championships<br />6th, ITT, UCI World Championships</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2020</strong><strong><br /></strong>2nd, ITT, UCI World Championships</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2021</strong><strong><br /></strong>1st, ITT, European Road Championships<br />2nd, ITT, UCI World Championships<br />2nd, ITT, Olympic Games</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2022</strong><strong><br /></strong>1st, ITT, European Road Championships<br />1st, Stage 4, Tour de France Femmes<br />3rd, ITT, UCI World Championships</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2023</strong><strong><br /></strong>1st, Gent-Wevelgem<br />1st, Tour de Suisse (including 1st, Stage 2 ITT)<br />1st, Stage 8 ITT, Tour de France Femmes</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reusser on…</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Caring about where her food comes from</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I think vegetables that are grown in very artificial, intense agriculture are not as good for you as things that are grown in a more natural, sustainable way.
