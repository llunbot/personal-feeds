{"title":"Insta360 Ace Pro 2 In-Depth Review","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/10/insta360-ace-pro-2-depth-review.html","date":1729612943000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>Insta360 has just launched their latest action cam, the Ace Pro 2. This unit adds an absolute boatload of smaller tweaks: Some hardware, some software depending on said new hardware. The headline features is the 8K functionality, though, that’s more of a spec bump from 8K/24FPS to 8/30FPS. Instead, I’d argue the headline features is the collection of just ‘darn useful stuff’ that’s there for daily usage.</p>\n<p>Things like the ability to charge your phone using reverse charging, from the Ace Pro 2. Or, the ability to use your smartphone instead of a GPS watch, to get speed/etc data overlays. Or for athletes, a notably wider field of view than the Ace Pro 1. There’s a lot to like here, and I’m thankful it’s not just a new chipset internally that nobody cares about (though, they have that too). Instead, it’s a slate of things that their competitors could probably learn from.</p>\n<p>Of course, that doesn’t mean it’s all perfect. In the above video, I dive into what works well (night modes), and what very much doesn’t (underwater modes). And everything in between.</p>\n<p>Thanks for watching!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"92a3271f24c0ffea9c3f9da7fcb95b306e83d6a96ab458696aa1569f257ac656","category":"Cycling"}
