The first NBA and NHL playoff series begin on Saturday, April 20, so the extra details will presumably become visible then. Some info like playoff matchups and conference standings was already available in the previous version of the app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nReleased in February, the Apple Sports app shows scores, schedules, stats, and more for a variety of leagues, such as the NBA, NHL, MLB, MLS, and Premier League. The app also displays real-time play-by-play information for ongoing games.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Sports is available for free <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-sports/id6446788829\">on the App Store</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-sports/\">Apple Sports</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/apple-sports-app-updated-for-nba-and-nhl-playoffs/\">Apple Sports App Updated for NBA and NHL Playoffs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sports-app-updated-for-nba-and-nhl-playoffs.2424229/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8d4706757fcc2ccbf44b3ba7e0437e234b822345ecd8e37064a0089916c396f6","category":"Apple"}
