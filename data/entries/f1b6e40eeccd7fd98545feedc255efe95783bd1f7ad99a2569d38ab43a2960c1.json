Perhaps you’d like to check out the newest hitch mounted tent, the Hitch-Home Duo+. Similar to the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/thule-outset-hitch-mounted-tent-is-a-portable-base-camp/\" target=\"_blank\">Thule Outset</a>, the Hitch-Home Duo+ is carried on your vehicle’s hitch, then deploys at the campsite leaving the vehicle free to roam. Unlike the Thule Outset, this tent is inflatable with an air mattress built right in. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.urang-global.com/\" target=\"_blank\">U-Rang</a> is a company that was born out of the “inconveniences of traditional camping”. Taking ideas from rooftop tents, camping trailers, and standard tents, they developed the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hitchhome/goodbye-rooftop-tents-hitch-home-duo-is-here?ref=92qtef\" target=\"_blank\">Hitch-Home Duo+</a>, what they’re calling a first in the hitch-type air tent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hitch-Home Duo+ combines camping adventures with quick detachable convenience. It only has a 3-minute setup, and no ladder is needed to access the wide sleeping area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fully funded in 5 hours, check out their <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hitchhome/goodbye-rooftop-tents-hitch-home-duo-is-here?ref=edsvyb&amp;utm_source=jellop&amp;ja=z2aimakj&amp;utm_term=007.ja&amp;utm_content=HitchHomeDuo-CL31&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_id=fb\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>No Rooftop Tent </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Release yourself from the constraints of rooftop tents (RTTs) to indulge in easy, comfortable camping with the Hitch-Home air tent. It attaches to your vehicle’s hitch, is lightweight and easy to transport. The tent lives in a box that mounts to the hitch, and then folds down to meet the ground. There are also wheels so you can roll it around to a more desireable location. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hitch-Home is a sturdy air tent that springs to life in just 3 minutes, just attach the pump and inflate. Once you are finished setting camp, the Hitch-Home will be fully inflated. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>No More Ladder</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Hitch-Home Duo+ being so close to the ground, there is no need for a ladder to access the sleeping space. No more middle-of-the-night climb down to handle nature’s call. The Hitch-Home Duo+ is easier to access.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wider than a 2-person RTT</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-sleeping-diagram.jpeg\"><img width=\"680\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-sleeping-diagram.jpeg\" alt=\"Hitch-Home Duo Kickstarter sleeping diagram\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-sleeping-diagram.jpeg 680w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-sleeping-diagram-297x192.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-sleeping-diagram-120x78.jpeg 120w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/U-Rang)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hitch-Home Duo+ claims to offer 22% wider interior space than a standard 2-person RTT. Right out of the box, the Hitch-Home can comfortably sleep 2 to 3 campers (though the third is shown as a small child).  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Built-in Air Mattress</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-bed-diagram.jpeg\"><img width=\"680\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-bed-diagram.jpeg\" alt=\"Hitch-Home Duo Kickstarter bed diagram\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-bed-diagram.jpeg 680w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-bed-diagram-297x183.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-bed-diagram-120x74.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sporting a built-in air mattress, the Hitch-Home is easily inflatable making it instantly comfortable. The bed is reinforced with sturdy aluminum panels at the base. The air mattress also provides support, guaranteeing a secure and stable foundation for a restful night. There is also adjustable leg support of 5.9″ making it adaptable on rugged terrain. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hitch-Home Duo+ Specifications</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-bed-diagram-specs.jpeg\"><img width=\"680\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-bed-diagram-specs.jpeg\" alt=\"Hitch-Home Duo+ tent sizes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-bed-diagram-specs.jpeg 680w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-bed-diagram-specs-274x300.jpeg 274w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hitch-Home-Duo-Kickstarter-bed-diagram-specs-110x120.jpeg 110w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Backer Rewards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Included with the Kickstarter Special: Tent body, Roof Fly, Trailer plug cable, Hitch-mount bracket, Ridge pole (top, front), Height adjustable up-right pole, String, and stakes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early Bird Pricing (limited to 30): $1,590 (reg. $3,560)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kickstarter Special: $1,770 (reg $3,560)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hitchhome/goodbye-rooftop-tents-hitch-home-duo-is-here?ref=edsvyb&amp;utm_source=jellop&amp;ja=z2aimakj&amp;utm_term=007.ja&amp;utm_content=HitchHomeDuo-CL31&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_id=fb\" target=\"_blank\">KickStarter.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-hitch-home-duo-inflatable-hitch-mounted-tent/\">Forget Roof Top Tents, the New Hitch-Home Duo+ is an Inflatable Tent You Can Deploy Anywhere</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f1b6e40eeccd7fd98545feedc255efe95783bd1f7ad99a2569d38ab43a2960c1","category":"Cycling"}
