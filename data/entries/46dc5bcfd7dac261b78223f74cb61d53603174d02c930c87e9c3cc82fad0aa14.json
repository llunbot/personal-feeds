{"title":"Cav's legacy: why there may never again be a sprinter like Mark Cavendish","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/cavs-legacy-why-there-may-never-again-be-a-sprinter-like-mark-cavendish","date":1731321000000,"content":"\n      <p>Whenever a sporting star begins to fade, the question is always asked: who is the next version of them going to be? Sport is a cyclical process, with each generation of protagonists succeeded by a new one, who measure themselves by the achievements of their predecessors by repeating the same feats and winning the same races. Just look at the history of the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> — since Jacques Anquetil became the first ever rider to win a fourth (and then a fifth) yellow jersey in the 1960s, the achievement has been repeated by a new rider in each decade since.</p>\n<div></div>\n<p>In the late-2010s, as health problems persisted and his form of old continued to elude him, the cycling world was wondering who the next Mark Cavendish would be. There were many candidates: Fernando Gaviria had made an explosive start to his career and seemed to have real star quality; Caleb Ewan resembled Cav with his small stature and low sprinting position, not to mention explosive speed; and Cavendish’s rival Marcel Kittel looked poised to fully emerge from his shadow and start to similarly dominate. But nobody was amassing huge hauls at Grand Tours of multiple stage wins the way Cavendish regularly did in his pomp.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/cy21-tdf-06-ab-01-0043_776bca8b-be01-4551-af0d-659f490d9f7f.jpg?v=1684834092\" alt=\"Mark Cavendish Tour de France\" /><em>The 2021 Tour de France was the scene of his rejuvenation (Photo: James Startt)</em></p>\n<p>Little did we expect that the closest thing we’ve seen to a new Cavendish has turned out to be…well, Cavendish himself. In 2021 he returned to the Tour de France for the first time in three years, and managed to instantly reestablish himself as the fastest man in the peloton over all of the young pretenders, looking every bit his old self as he stormed his way to four stage wins and the green jersey. Having seemed down and out and set for a reluctant retirement mere months before, this was instantly recognised as one of the great sporting comebacks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/can-you-hear-me-now-mark-cavendish-on-his-new-approach-to-life\"><strong><em>Read more: Mark Cavendish on his new approach to life</em></strong></a></p>\n<p>Merely winning the one stage at that comeback Tour would alone have been miraculous. Even during his peak years, Cavendish was always at pains to insist that he would be content so long as he won at least once, and never was that more evidently the case when, in 2021, he collapsed in tears over the finish line in Fougères having just claimed his first stage victory for five years. But he wasn’t done yet, and went on to win a second, third, then fourth, in just as dominant a manner as he used to. Whenever people begin to count Cav out, he exceeds expectations. He did it again in the 2024 Tour when he won his historic, breathtaking 35th stage win in Saint Vulbas.</p>\n<p>It’s been said that the nature of contemporary cycling is making it more difficult for a single sprinter to dominate as Cav had once done. The sprinting field is more evenly-matched, and, with so many different talented fastmen vying for success, no single team like Cavendish’s Colombia-HTC and Quick-Step line-ups are capable of maintaining a strangle-hold in the lead-outs. Racing is more aggressive these days, too, with puncheurs and attackers less content to simply let stages drift into mass bunch sprints. And Grand Tour organisers are no longer catering for pure sprinters like Cavendish, including fewer straightforwardly flat stages in favour of added difficulties to thwart them. All of these theories do sound convincing, yet Cavendish has still been able to buck the trend. </p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-107204a_1024x1024.jpg?v=1731320776\" /></div>\n<p><em>Cavendish wins Stage 5 of the 2024 Tour de France, taking his total stage wins to 35 and breaking the record of 34 he shared with Belgian cycling legend Eddy Merckx (Photo: Zac Williams/SWpix)</em></p>\n<p>All this is to say that, for all the speculation as to who the next Mark Cavendish will be, it’s plausible that cycling will never see his like again. Many will be compared to him, but nobody will equal him.</p>\n<p>There’s so much else to be said about Cavendish, from his other achievements elsewhere on the road and track, and his towering personality as a man who both wore his heart on his sleeve, and an intellect who could deconstruct a sprint finish like no other, that we’ve barely scratched the surface into everything that has made him such a giant of the sport. But as an athlete, the facet that he may best be remembered for is for his all-conquering, unstoppable sprint victories over so many years at the Tour de France, a reign of dominance that was both unprecedented, and, as the nature of cycling and sprinting continue to change, unlikely to be ever repeated in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Cover photo by Zac Williams/SWPix</em></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"46dc5bcfd7dac261b78223f74cb61d53603174d02c930c87e9c3cc82fad0aa14","category":"Cycling"}
