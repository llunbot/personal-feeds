The person on the receiving end of an iMessage sent using a satellite connection needs <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> or later, while SMS messages require iOS 17.6 or later or a non-Apple device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith Messages via Satellite, iMessages and SMS messages can be sent using a satellite connection, while location information can also be updated in the ‌Find My‌ app using satellite connectivity. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsing Messages and ‌Find My‌ without Wi-Fi or cellular will require users to hold their iPhones up to the sky to establish a connection. Open spaces with no trees or buildings make it easier to connect, and speed up message sending and receiving. Emoji and Tapback responses are supported, but images, videos, audio messages, stickers, and group messages do not work over satellite.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe option to use satellite connectivity for Messages will display automatically when Wi-Fi and cellular connections are not available, and users will be able to tap to connect by following Apple's instructions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMessages via Satellite is now available in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The functionality continues to be free for all ‌iPhone‌ users with a compatible device.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-satellite-features/\">iPhone Satellite Features</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/messages-via-satellite-mexico/\">Messages and Find My via Satellite Expand to Mexico</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/messages-and-find-my-via-satellite-expand-to-mexico.2457824/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"69cacfd50c28cce1ee29488b28f5e5f6abaa9d42fece1c2a80f9be9295b64252","category":"Apple"}
