The repair program launched last year <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/samsung-and-ifixit-launch-repair-program-for-flagship-phones-and-tablets/\">in partnership</a> with iFixit, and now Samsung will be offering parts and repair manuals for more phones in more countries.</p>\n<p>First up, the device list is adding some of Samsung's newest and most expensive models. Foldables are landing in the self-repair system for the first time, with the Galaxy Z Flip5, and Z Fold5 getting parts and manuals soon. The parts aren't up for sale yet, but we're dying to know the cost of a Z Fold5 display. (The Pixel Fold, a similarly sized flexible Samsung display, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/the-pixel-folds-screen-repair-will-cost-900/\">costs $900</a>.) Samsung's current slab-phone flagship is also hitting the repair system for the first time, with all S23 models getting included. The Galaxy A05s, the first mid-range phone, is landing in the system, too. All the Galaxy S9 and A9 tablets are now repairable, as is the Galaxy Book 2 Pro laptop.</p>\n<p>The number of countries where you can buy parts is increasing, too. Samsung's repair program is currently active in the US, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. Samsung now says it's expanding the repair program to 30 additional companies, with the full list being: \"Albania, Andorra, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Kosovo, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Switzerland.\" Forty-three countries is a huge progression in just a year, but the flagship S23 is sold in <a href=\"https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20230217000416\">130 countries </a>if Samsung wants complete coverage.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992235#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992235&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eb26322da365ee81674dafb34349c13a04d17df7ab9803990de248a281b02374","category":"Tech"}
