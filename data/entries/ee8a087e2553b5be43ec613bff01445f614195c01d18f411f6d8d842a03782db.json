But the team behind DerbyWheel, an ambitious new keirin racing series set to launch early next year, is determined to change that and bring track cycling to a new audience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kicking off in March next year with an exhibition event, before starting full-time in mid-April, DerbyWheel aims to host the world’s best keirin riders every week in an intense three-day racing format that merges <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/japanese-keirin-sport-and-culture-beyond-the-velodrome\" target=\"_blank\">traditional Japanese and Korean keirin</a> with international competitors. Riders will compete in velodromes across the world, including Manchester’s National Cycling Centre and the DISC Velodrome in Melbourne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an idea that James Pope, CEO of DerbyWheel Player (the company’s UK arm) has had for a long time. It almost materialised in Manchester in 2012, but it wasn’t until Pope was approached by some of the brains behind Korea’s domestic keirin circuit – including DJ Hyun, CEO of DerbyWheel’s Korean parent company – that it finally got off the ground. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/03145228/japanese_keirin_racing-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"japanese_keirin_racing\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/03145228/japanese_keirin_racing-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/03145228/japanese_keirin_racing-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/03145228/japanese_keirin_racing-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/03145228/japanese_keirin_racing-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/03145228/japanese_keirin_racing-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/03145228/japanese_keirin_racing-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/03/03145228/japanese_keirin_racing.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Fred MacGregor</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Another key player is former Commonwealth Games sprint gold medallist and new Director of Sport Ross Edgar, who had ridden the Japanese keirin himself four times and was eager to get involved. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The series will involve three categories of athletes – General, Excellent, and Special – the latter being for elite riders who will have more flexibility when they race. Around 400 names are currently registered to take part, largely Japanese and Korean riders as well as those from the UCI calendar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of the full-time, professional racing will feature riders breaking into the professional circuit and national squads, as well as those at the tail end of their careers that can still compete to a high level. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weekly races will culminate in Grand Prix showpiece events three times a year, which Pope promises will be a ‘festival of cycling’, featuring those who qualify on points as well as elite professionals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pope is hoping some of track cycling’s biggest stars will take part. ‘That’s what’s going to be really exciting – seeing those [lower-level] riders battle to try and get into those Grand Prix events and take on the best in the world.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that stands out is the intention to level the playing field for athletes. Riders will race on bikes built around a list of approved frames with standardised spoked wheels, and will wear a traditional uniform – similar to the brightly-coloured Japanese and Korean keirin outfits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’ll be no <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hope-lotus-track-bike-team-gb-2023\" target=\"_blank\">British Cycling Lotus</a> frames here, then – but Pope says the traditional aspects of the series will be ‘modernised a bit’, with riders in more fitted aerodynamic jerseys similar to those international fans will be familiar with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the series develops it also plans to extend track cycling’s reach beyond its traditional hubs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Rev_Keirin2-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Rev_Keirin2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Rev_Keirin2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Rev_Keirin2-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Rev_Keirin2-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Rev_Keirin2-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Rev_Keirin2-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Rev_Keirin2-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Rev_Keirin2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Rev_Keirin2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Rev_Keirin2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Revolution</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Longer-term we want to invest back into the sport by supporting talent development, by working closely with national federations and setting up DerbyWheel keirin academies,’ says Pope. ‘That will give us a fresh intake of riders but also benefit the national systems, a lot of which have quite limited budgets and can only fund their top riders.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He mentions Africa in particular as a key destination, where DerbyWheel has another base. ‘There is definitely a desire and an appetite to do that [in Africa] but there is just very limited opportunity and funding. We have colleagues based in Africa who we’re going to be supporting on that journey – it’s not just about investing in the western countries, it’s supporting developing countries as well.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other UCI race rules will be followed and with the racing happening in velodromes worldwide, Japanese and Korean riders will have to adjust to the standard 250m indoor tracks in use. But some elements will be closer to home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘A lot of the riders in Japan and Korea come in on the race weekend and they’re effectively in this kind of bubble,’ Pope explains. ‘They hand over their phones and they’ve got no contact with the outside world and they live in this special compound and holding area. We’re going to replicate some elements of that because we want to keep those riders quite contained.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s keeping traditional elements of the racing, Pope says that DerbyWheel isn’t just for existing track cycling fans. ‘Our ambition is that DerbyWheel will help to grow the track cycling fan base. When we do the Grand Prix events, we’ll be bringing in live KPop bands and entertainers, hopefully to bring younger people in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Regular races will be directed more towards pro keirin fans and the kind of person that is interested in putting a bet on but the broader picture is to boost the sport and reach more of a global audience, to broaden outside of those Asian markets where it’s incredibly popular at the minute.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-keirin-2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-keirin-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-keirin-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-keirin-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-keirin-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-keirin-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-keirin-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-keirin-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-keirin-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-keirin-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-keirin-2.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Laura Fletcher</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us onto sports betting. In Japan and Korea keirin racing is one of only a few sports that are legal to bet on and has become a multi-billion dollar industry. That success is what DerbyWheel is hoping to emulate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help facilitate that side of the competition, DerbyWheel has just announced a partnership with sports technology company <a href=\"https://sportradar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sportradar</a>, which Pope says will ‘assist with monitoring, investigating and preventing any match fixing or interference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s all about ensuring the fairness of the sport, both on the anti-doping side of things and in competition manipulation. A key part of it is monitoring betting activity and that’s what Sportradar will focus on doing. If there is any irregular activity, red flags, they will pick that up, and it will go to an independent arbitration board if we feel that there is wrongdoing undertaken. There’ll be severe sanctions and penalties. So we’re going to be implementing those processes to make sure that we prevent any integrity threats to the competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We see sports betting as a pastime, part and parcel of sport. I think what we have to be mindful of is ensuring that people are doing that in a responsible way, following all of those protocols and safeguarding measures to make sure that we’re doing the right thing while creating a really exciting product that people can have fun with.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lucrative business model is set to benefit riders, with almost £500,000 in total on the line at elite level events – although pros in the Special class will earn more than the other tiers. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"491\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-prize-money-970x491.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-prize-money-970x491.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-prize-money-300x152.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-prize-money-768x389.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-prize-money-1536x778.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-prize-money-750x380.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-prize-money-1140x578.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/derbywheel-prize-money.png 1745w\" /><figcaption>DerbyWheel</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s very hard for track sprinters to make a living if you’re not in that top echelon,’ says Pope. ‘So our intention is that DerbyWheel can provide the platform for riders to become professional keirin racers and make it their full time job. I think the business model and the elements of sports betting gives us the ability to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The key priority for us is to transform the economy of track cycling, to enable riders and stakeholders to grow and stay in the sport and bring new people into it. There are a lot of venues too that are empty, not used that often, that are quite excited by this project because they’ll get regular content.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pope has previous experience in running the UK-based Revolution track cycling series and has high hopes for this new venture. ‘We saw kids come through the Future Stars [development programme] such as <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no18-laura-kenny\">Laura Kenny</a>, who went on to become an Olympic gold medallist. So it’d be great if the DerbyWheel platform can create that same pathway for more cyclists to get into the sport, do what they love, and have success themselves and share the success of this project.’</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/derbywheel-keirin\">DerbyWheel: The series aiming to take Japanese and Korean keirin racing worldwide</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Deputy Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"ee8a087e2553b5be43ec613bff01445f614195c01d18f411f6d8d842a03782db","category":"Cycling"}
