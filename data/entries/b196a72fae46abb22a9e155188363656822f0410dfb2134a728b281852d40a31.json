(Past-gen software on Series X/S can be installed to older, slower storage options connected via USB ports.)</p>\n<p>The modder learned via a teardown video that the Xbox Series S uses two PCIe 4.0 ports to house its NVMe SSD and external expansion, and, crucially, that the console's external expansion card uses the CFExpress protocol, which also uses an NVMe interface. (Asian video-sharing sites like Bilibili generally work like YouTube, except users can often post blog-style entries as well as videos, hence the tutorial.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793731#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1793731&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Steve Haske","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b196a72fae46abb22a9e155188363656822f0410dfb2134a728b281852d40a31","category":"Tech"}
