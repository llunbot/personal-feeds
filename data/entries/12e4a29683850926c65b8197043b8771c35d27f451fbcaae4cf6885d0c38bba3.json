That’s all very well, but Apple’s most recent version of macOS, Sonoma, won’t run on a Mac mini, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro that launched before 2018, iMac’s from before 2019, or the Mac Pro from before 2019. If your Mac is to old to be supported you are out of luck… Or are you? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if your Mac or MacBook is older than those mentioned above? Officially this means that your Mac can’t officially be updated to macOS Sonoma… yet. If Apple deems your Mac too old to run Sonoma, or any other versions of macOS, updating is not simple, but it is possible with an OpenCore Legacy Patcher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The OpenCore Legacy Patcher for macOS Sonoma, which will enable this, is expected to arrive in October 2023. Although there is an <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/pull/1077&amp;xcust=1-1-672461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">early preview (here)</a> that offers “preliminary support”. Patchers are currently available for other macOS versions including Ventura and Monterey. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why run a new macOS version on an old Mac?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not only Sonoma that is limited to newer Macs. macOS Ventura won’t run on a MacBook, MacBook Pro or iMac that launched before 2017, or a pre-2018 MacBook Air or Mac mini. macOS Monterey won’t run on MacBook Air, MacBook Pro or iMac models that launched before late 2015, and if you have a pre-2014 Mac mini or a pre-2013 Mac Pro you are out of luck. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a good reason why you might want to run one of these three macOS versions on your Mac. Apple supports only the past three versions with security updates – which means that is your Mac isn’t able to update it may be vulnerable to security threats.

Older Macs just don’t have the necessary components or power required to cope with the demands of the more modern systems. So if you do install Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, or older, on an unsupported Mac don’t expect it to run smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should expect to encounter problems. Be prepared for the fact that your Mac will not function optimally and you could lose data. (For that reason we recommend making a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671336/how-to-back-up-a-mac-or-macbook.html\">full backup of your Mac first</a>). For example, many older Macs had problems with the Wi-Fi connection after installing macOS Big Sur. Running macOS on an unsupported Mac may also be considered against Apple’s terms and conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wondering if it’s even worth updating your Mac? Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1984389/macos-sonoma-vs-macos-ventura-should-you-update.html\">macOS Sonoma vs Ventura</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you really want to run Sonoma maybe it’s time to upgrade your Mac and sell your old one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670942/how-to-sell-a-mac-or-macbook.html\">How to sell an old Mac</a> and our frequently updated best Mac deals: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673333/best-macbook-air-deals.html\">Best MacBook Air deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672811/best-macbook-pro-deals.html\">Best MacBook Pro deals this month</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673695/best-mac-mini-deals.html\">The best Mac mini deals this month</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672803/best-imac-deals.html\">Best iMac deals this month</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>When will the Sonoma patch be available?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of macOS Sonoma, the Patch won’t be available until October, although preliminary support is available at the time of writing in the form of an early preview. When the patcher arrives we will update this story with details of how to update an old Mac to Sonoma. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>With Sonoma a day away, wanted to give the community a bit of a heads up with where OpenCore Legacy Patcher is.<br /><br />We were hoping for an October release, and so unfortunately won’t have day 1 support tomorrow. Instead we'll be releasing OCLP 1.0.0 on Oct 2:<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/Iln3SpbqZW&amp;xcust=1-1-672461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/Iln3SpbqZW</a></p>— Mykola Grymalyuk (@khronokernel) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/khronokernel/status/1706386367234855205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-672461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">September 25, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to install Ventura on an unsupported Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Mac is more than a few years old and you try to install Ventura on it you will hit a few hurdles – the first being the fact that Software Update won’t let you install the new version of macOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this doesn’t mean that installing Ventura on an older Mac isn’t possible. It is – you just need a patch. Luckily there’s a patcher for installing macOS Ventura on older Macs available – the OpenCore Legacy Patcher. The download and instructions can be found <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/START.html&amp;xcust=1-1-672461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that macOS patchers cannot perform magic and not all Macs will be compatible. Before installing Ventura on an older Mac, make sure that your Mac is compatible with the patcher. You can find a list of all the Macs supported <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/MODELS.html&amp;xcust=1-1-672461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The procedure for updating to a new version of macOS on incompatible Macs is as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Before you do anything back up your Mac, just in case.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>First you will need to obtain the installation files for the version of macOS you are after – in this case Ventura. You’ll have to obtain these using a compatible Mac. If they don’t show up in Software Update you can get the installation files from the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-ventura/id1638787999?mt=12&amp;xcust=1-1-672461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Mac App Store</a>. They are over 12GB so expect the download to take a while.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once they are downloaded you need to load these installation files onto a USB stick and prepare the USB stick for installing macOS Ventura. We explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671308/how-to-create-a-bootable-usb-macos-installer.html\">how to create a bootable installer of macOS</a> in a separate article. You’ll be able to find the installation files in Finder &gt; Applications. (Open Finder and press Shift + Command + A). </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Next you need to obtain the patcher software that will essentially trick the installation files of the version of macOS you want to install into believing that the Mac is compatible. You can download the latest version of the patcher we mentioned above <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://github.com/dortania/Opencore-Legacy-Patcher/releases&amp;xcust=1-1-672461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">here</a>. Click on the Code and then the green Code button, and then the Download Zip button.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>After extracting the archive from your download you will find the file “OpenCore-Patcher.app”.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run the OpenCore-Patcher app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose Build OpenCore (unless you wish to run the patcher on a different Mac, in which case it’s Change Model).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once in Build OpenCore the process should quickly build and then you will return to the main menu.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The next step is to choose Install OpenCore to USB/internal drive from the options. (The recommendation is to install on a FAT32 drive.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once that has been created you need to reboot your Mac while holding down the Option (Alt) key.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When the Mac starts up there will be a black screen with a few drive options. Select EFI Boot. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>This will load up OpenCore. Next you need to select Install macOS, you should see the option Install macOS Ventura in the OpenCore Picker.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now install macOS Ventura.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend that you follow the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/INSTALLER.html&amp;xcust=1-1-672461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">steps outlined here</a> if you have any problems. Expect the update to take several hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to install macOS updates on an unsupported Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have installed macOS Ventura (or whatever version of macOS you choose), updates will appear in Software Updates as soon as they are available. However, you should not install these. Instead you need to create a USB stick with the new installation files and install the update in that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to install Monterey on an unsupported Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The process is the same if you want to install Monterey on your Mac. As above, the download and instructions can be found <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/START.html#patcher-warnings&amp;xcust=1-1-672461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just beware that Boot Camp Assistant might be broken on Macs that support that app, and other elements you are used to may not work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You use the same patcher as above as that patcher supports Big Sur and newer for patching. You can check to see if your Mac is compatible with the patcher <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/MODELS.html&amp;xcust=1-1-672461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The procedure for updating to a new version of macOS on incompatible Macs is the same as above, although you’ll need to use the Monterey installation files (which you can get from the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/macos-monterey/id1576738294?mt=12&amp;xcust=1-1-672461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Mac App Store</a>). They are 12GB so expect this to take a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once OpenCore is up and running you will be able to select Install macOS, you should see the option Install macOS Monterey in the OpenCore Picker. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to install Big Sur on an unsupported Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing Big Sur on an unsupported Mac is similarly tricky, but, again, this doesn’t mean that installing Big Sur on an older Mac isn’t possible. You can use the same patcher as above, there’s also a patcher for installing macOS Big Sur on older Macs available – the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://github.com/barrykn/big-sur-micropatcher&amp;xcust=1-1-672461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">big-sur-micropatcher</a> can be downloaded from GitHub. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check that the patcher is compatible with your Mac – you should find this information on the patch page (linked above).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The procedure for updating to an incompatible Mac to Big Sur is the same as above. This time you can obtain the installation files from this <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-big-sur/id1526878132?mt=12&amp;xcust=1-1-672461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Mac App Store</a> link. Follow our guide linked to above to make a bootable installer. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>If you download the Big Sur patcher from <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://github.com/barrykn/big-sur-micropatcher&amp;xcust=1-1-672461-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a><span>, click on the Code and Download Zip buttons.</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li>After extracting the archive from your download you will find the file “micropatcher.sh”.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open a terminal window and drag and drop the file into the terminal. Then run the command.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now install macOS from your bootable installer.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, there are still tasks to be performed after the installation. These can be found in the instructions for big-sur-micropatcher. After preparing the Mac with the USB stick, start a terminal and enter “/ Volumes / Image  Volume / set-vars.sh”. The script is part of the patch for macOS Big Sur and changes important settings for booting and system files.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3654960/terminal_code_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Install Big Sure old Mac\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The update can take several hours. In our case it sometimes looked like the installer had crashed during the update. In this case you should wait, as the installation is usually still in progress. Over time, better ways to update a machine may be found. Currently, the safest approach is to update using a bootable USB stick.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to run Catalina on an old Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple advises that macOS Catalina will run on the following Macs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>MacBook models from early 2015 or later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook Air models from mid-2012 or later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook Pro models from mid-2012 or later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac mini models from late 2012 or later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iMac models from late 2012 or later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iMac Pro (all models)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Pro models from late 2013</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can download a macOS Catalina Patcher from a developer known as DOSDude1.

With the patch installed you can go back as far as early 2008 models. It’s unlikely to run like a dream, which is why Apple advises against this course of action. But you should be able to achieve tolerable performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\nMac, MacBook, MacOS, Personal Software</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"12e4a29683850926c65b8197043b8771c35d27f451fbcaae4cf6885d0c38bba3","category":"Apple"}
