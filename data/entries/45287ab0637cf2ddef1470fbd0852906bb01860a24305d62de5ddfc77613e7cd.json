The new bike takes much of what made the previous versions so well regarded, but removes the often-maligned PF30a press-fit bottom bracket and replaces it with a 68mm BSA threaded model. The front-end design and down tube have also been refined and there’s a new proprietary seatpost, too.</p>\n<p>Out on the road, the SuperSix Evo balances its inspired handling with compliance and stiffness. It’s a particularly adept climber, feeling assured and firm when under the rider and when you want to put the power down, it rockets forward. The new aero seatpost isn’t as stiff as you might expect, offering a good amount of buzz-reducing compliance.</p>\n<p>The Shimano Ultegra R8100 groupset on this build is BikeRadar’s pick of the Japanese brand’s latest groupsets and we were impressed by the newly updated flagship HollowGram R-SL 50 wheels, too. Although Cannondale specs Continental Grand Prix 5000 tyres, they’re in a 25mm width and we’d be keen to run wider rubber. We also suspect the Vision Trimax won’t suit those with smaller hands because the tops are very deep.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cannondale-supersix-evo-hi-mod-2-review/\">Read our full Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod 2 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Canyon Ultimate CF SLX 8 Di2</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Ultimate CF SLX 8 Di2 road bike\" title=\"Canyon Ultimate CF SLX 8 Di2 - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Ultimate CF SLX outperforms its pricier sibling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£6,199 / $5,499 / €6,499 / AU$9,899 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 7.26kg (L)</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Cheaper than Ultimate CFR; smother than Ultimate CFR</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Can’t customise components at purchase</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Canyon Ultimate CF SLX 8 Di2 sits below the range-topping CFR, but our tester found it to be smoother with the same handling and stiffness as the pricier model.</p>\n<p>In short, you get better value for money with this Shimano Ultegra-equipped bike and a more balanced ride, earning it a place on the very top shelf of current road bikes.</p>\n<p>It’s a shame you can’t customise the build at the point of purchase, which might be an annoyance if you prefer an inline seatpost.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/canyon-ultimate-cf-slx-8-di2-review/\">Read our full Canyon Ultimate CF SLX 8 Di2 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>ENVE Melee (Ultegra Di2 build)</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"ENVE Melee (Ultegra Di2 build) road bike\" title=\"ENVE Melee (Ultegra Di2 build) - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The ability to mould the Melee to your needs makes it a real winner.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£5,500 / $5,500 / €5,500 for frame ‘chassis’ | £10,400 / $12,834 / AU$19,220 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 7.8kg (58cm in this example build)</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Outstanding handling balanced with great comfort and geometry</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive and you can’t buy a full build off the peg</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ENVE Melee took our 2023 Performance Bike of the Year crown, thanks to its outstanding handling and balanced comfort. The brand’s second bike after the Custom Road has been aerodynamically optimised, albeit with a slightly taller ride position than you’ll find on longer and lower bikes. The Melee also fully integrates its cables and hoses and uses a D-shaped seatpost.</p>\n<p>We found the Melee to be one of the easiest-handling race bikes on the market and we were struck by how stable and composed it is in every scenario. It deals with everything with real calmness.</p>\n<p>A stable and composed ride can sometimes be a little boring, but there’s none of that here. The Melee’s reaction to inputs is quick and it’s unperturbed by crosswinds.</p>\n<p>Unlike the other bikes on this list, the Melee is sold as a ‘chassis’ – a frame, fork, stem, handlebar, seatpost and thru-axles.

The tube shapes are rounded, which Basso says is designed to improve stiffness and efficiency, while minimising weight.</p>\n<p>The geometry is in pure race bike territory – long and low, so you’ll want to have a long think about whether it will work for you and carefully study the geometry chart. That said, in testing we found the Diamante to balance its tactile handling with satisfying stiffness. It’s surprisingly comfortable, too, thanks to the slim seatstays and carbon seatpost.</p>\n<p>There’s little to criticise with the Ultegra Di2 specced. The second-tier groupset delivers identical shifting and braking performance to Dura-Ace with a compelling cost saving. We also rated the Microtech RE38 wheels – many own-brand efforts can vary in design modernity, but these are on the money with a 23mm internal rim width.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/basso-diamante-ultegra-di2-review/\">Read our full Basso Diamante Ultegra Di2 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>BMC Teammachine SLR 01 Two</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2021 BMC Teammachine SLR 01\" title=\"2021 BMC Teammachine SLR 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s very little to fault about the BMC Teammachine SLR 01 Two, but it’s very expensive.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BMC</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£9,800 / $10,999 / €10,499 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 7.09kg (56cm)</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Lightweight and fast</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> High price</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The latest iteration of BMC’s excellent Teammachine learns lessons from the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/bmc-timemachine-r01-review/\">Timemachine</a> (BMC’s aero road bike) to improve its aerodynamic efficiency, without adding too much weight.</p>\n<p>In fact, its 7.09kg weight makes the BMC Teammachine SLR 01 Two one of the lightest bikes on this list, and that’s seriously impressive considering it has aero wheels, disc brakes and plenty of other aero features.</p>\n<p>The omission of a Dura-Ace crankset in favour of Rotor is perhaps the only minor criticism we could make of a bike that’s otherwise extremely hard to find fault with.

But with the rise of computer modelling, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/notio-konect-provides-all-your-aero-data-without-a-wind-tunnel/\">on-bike aero sensors</a> and other advanced testing techniques, this has all changed.</p>\n<p>Even dedicated climbing bikes are now launching, with brands touting their aerodynamic efficiency.</p>\n<p>Take the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-trek-emonda/\">Trek Emonda</a>, for example. Trek says it has been designed specifically for the rigours of iconic <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/tour-de-france/\">Tour de France</a> climbs such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/alpe-dhuez-the-hollywood-climb-video/\">Alpe d’Huez</a> (a 13.85km monster in the French Alps), yet still features extensive aero treatment.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cannondale SystemSix Hi-Mod Dura-Ace Di2; 'the fastest bike in the world'\" title=\"br_01788-1534851224961-16i5iyd0gv46l-a5937da\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cannondale says its burly SystemSix aero bike is its fastest bike on gradients of up to 6 per cent, regardless of the weight penalty.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Aoife Glass / Immediate Media co</i></span></div>\n<p>True hill climb aficionados will no doubt be tearing their hair out at this point, exclaiming ‘anything under 10 per cent isn’t even a proper hill anyway!’, but if you want to go fast, aero always matters, regardless of the gradient.</p>\n<p>It’s true that aerodynamic drag becomes a smaller part of the equation as gradients increase in severity, but the absolute amount of air resistance you experience remains the same for any given speed.</p>\n<p>On top of that, the power to overcome any increase in air resistance is proportional to the cube of speed. So, if you want to ride your bicycle twice as fast, you’ll need eight times more power to overcome the extra drag force, unless you can reduce your aerodynamic drag.</p>\n<p>In an ideal world, then, you want a bike that’s both lightweight and aero for smashing hills.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Computational fluid dynamics modeling of the Kamm Tail tube shaping on Trek's new Madone 7-Series frame\" title=\"1340764107115-1kquhghyzxbl4-3e6fb0c\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> One of the first brands to use Kammtail tubes was Trek.

Chung is perhaps most famous for devising the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/aerodynamics-made-easy/\">‘Chung Method’</a> of calculating aerodynamic drag, but he also reminds us of the importance of not ignoring rolling resistance.</p>\n<p>Using a power equation for wheeled vehicles (such as the one found at <a href=\"http://www.kreuzotter.de/english/espeed.htm#bmi\" target=\"_blank\">www.kreuzotter.de</a>), he showed that even a relatively small difference in rolling resistance (Crr stands for ‘coefficient of rolling resistance’) can be worth as much as large changes in weight, even on steep gradients.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Weight weenies should be Crr weenies. We can convert differences in Crr to \"equivalent\" differences in mass. Even small differences in Crr are equivalent to 100's of grams of mass difference on steep hills. <a href=\"https://t.co/YSASEisid0\">pic.twitter.com/YSASEisid0</a></p>— @rchung@mstdn.social (@therealrchung) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/therealrchung/status/1122525676295217152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 28, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<p>Chung’s graph plots the difference in Crr between Continental’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/continental-grand-prix-4000-sii-review/\">GP4000S II</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/continental-has-finally-developed-a-tubeless-road-tyre-gp-5000-tl-first-look/\">GP5000</a> tyres in terms of the equivalent efficiency found through weight loss on different gradients.</p>\n<p>On a flat road, it’s clear that even a relatively small decrease in rolling resistance is worth more than practically any increase in weight. What’s really interesting to note though, is that changing from a GP4000 to a GP5000 is still worth more than 500g of extra mass even on a 10 per cent slope.</p>\n<p>Yes, that’s right; the small difference in rolling resistance between two of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">best road bikes tyres</a> can have a greater effect on your efficiency than 500g of extra weight even on a 10 per cent slope, and that equivalent mass penalty only increases as the gradient gets shallower. On a 6 per cent slope, the difference is equivalent to a kilogram of extra mass.</p>\n<p>The key takeaway is that you shouldn’t just look at weight figures when shopping for tyres. The differences in rolling resistance between tyres will be worth far more to your climbing speed than any minor weight variations.</p>\n<h3>Gearing and cadence when climbing</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jack’s Canyon Ultimate CF SLX Haute Route Davos Horse for the Course\" title=\"@OpenProd - HR DAVOS - Canyon RP-11\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An 11-30t cassette is increasingly the norm for climbing bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Olivier Penpenic / Haute Route </i></span></div>\n<p>Some riders apparently enjoy using singlespeed or even <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/can-one-gear-really-work-for-hill-climbs/\">fixed-gear bikes for climbing hills</a>.
