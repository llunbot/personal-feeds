Marketers, salespeople, and even <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/43z3dn/hundreds-bounty-hunters-att-tmobile-sprint-customer-location-data-years\">bounty hunters</a> were able to pay shadowy third-party companies to track where people have been, using information that carriers gathered from interactions between your phone and nearby cell towers. Even after promising to stop selling the data, the major carriers—AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon—reportedly <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/carriers-sell-location-data-third-parties-privacy/\">continued the practice</a> in the US until <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/fcc-fines-wireless-companies-selling-users-location-data/\">the Federal Communications Commission proposed</a> nearly $200 million in combined fines. Carriers remain <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-to-step-up-ad-targeting-of-cellphone-customers-11615285803\">perennially hungry</a> to <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/how-to-stop-tmobile-att-verizon-from-sharing-my-data\">know as much</a> about you as they can.

For years, it's seemed like little could be done about this leakage because cutting off access to this data would likely require the sort of systemic upgrades that carriers are loath to make.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787083#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787083&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"51bf4e0668c5ed701e31f43f5ec2e4e1d22a5b0acf33d721d26519d73f7f1c83","category":"Tech"}
