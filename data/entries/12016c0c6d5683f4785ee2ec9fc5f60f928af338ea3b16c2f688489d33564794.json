Up top is the new 9-52, which pairs e13’s ultra-small 9-tooth cog starter with a new 52-tooth large cog, giving them a claimed 578% range…a big jump compared to the 520% and 510% of SRAM and Shimano’s widest cassettes, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cassettes use their two-piece design, with the two largest cogs being aluminum, and the main cluster being machined from steel. They fit to a SRAM XD freehub body, and if you already have the 9-50 cassette, you can swap in the new 43-52 alloy bit to get the increased range.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-01.jpg\" alt=\"e-thirteen helix race close range cassette\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-01.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But the more interesting one might be this “close range” cassette that starts at 13 and goes to 52. That’s a narrower range, but it gives them smaller gear steps, which they prioritized putting near the top (big) end of the cassette for easier cadence management.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-03.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2222\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-03.jpg\" alt=\"e-thirteen helix race close range cassette\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-03.jpg 2222w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-03-297x134.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-03-800x360.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-03-120x54.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-03-768x346.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-03-1536x691.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-03-2048x922.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to give e-mountain bikers a more useful cassette that shifts easier under load, but it also works just fine for 100% human powered bikes, too. Here’s how it compares, cog by cog:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Helix Race Close Ratio:</strong> 13-15-17-19-22-25-28-32-36-40-45-52</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Helix Race Wide Range:</strong> 9-11-13-15-17-20-23-27-31-36-43-52</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>SRAM Eagle 10-52:</strong> 10-12-14-16-18-21-24-28-32-38-44-52</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And here’s what that looks like in a chart:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-comp-chart.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1274\" height=\"992\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-comp-chart.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-comp-chart.jpg 1274w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-comp-chart-297x231.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-comp-chart-800x623.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-comp-chart-120x93.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-13-52-close-ratio-wide-range-MTB-cassette-comp-chart-768x598.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new wide range cassette weighs in at 392g, and the close range is 467g as the cogs are bigger and it’s reinforced for e-bike use. Both come in five anodized color options, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-e-bike-chainrings-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1249\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-e-bike-chainrings-01.jpg\" alt=\"e-thirteen e-MTB chainrings\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-e-bike-chainrings-01.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-e-bike-chainrings-01-297x206.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-e-bike-chainrings-01-800x555.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-e-bike-chainrings-01-120x83.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-e-bike-chainrings-01-768x533.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/e-thirteen-e-bike-chainrings-01-1536x1066.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In other news, they’ve expanded their chainring lineup to include e-bike chainrings for Bosch, Fazua, Brose, and Shimano. They, too, will come in all the colors, so you can match your drivetrain up…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a

cornering. It comes in two versions, a 120tpi XC casing for the most supple performance, and a Trail version with more supportive 72tpi casing and nylon breaker under the tread cap for added puncture protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claimed weight is 812g (XC) and 852g (TR) for 29er, and 698g / 766g for 27.5, all available only in a 2.4″ width. It’s a dual compound rubber with 50a side knobs and 56a center section. MSRP is $64.95.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.ethirteen.com\" target=\"_blank\">eThirteen.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/e13-close-range-cassette-and-tools/\">eThirteen debuts Close Range Cassette, XC tire, neat tools &amp; more</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"12016c0c6d5683f4785ee2ec9fc5f60f928af338ea3b16c2f688489d33564794","category":"Cycling"}
