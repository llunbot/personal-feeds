They didn’t tell us what’s the reason of visit, but we will found this out today through lawyers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pau, the scene of the raid, has a weird history with the Tour de France. It was where Frank Schleck left the Tour de France after a positive doping test in 2012 and where Lance Armstrong held his infamous press conference to deny allegations of cheating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems the legacy of Pau continues with news of the Bahrain Victorious raid, although no arrests were made, the police did seize training files from the team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story is ongoing. </em></p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/police-search-bahrain-victorious-tour-de-france-team-hotel/\">Read More</a>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"f4b25e9378efdf8bb8e4685b84a33721f58bb02eec0181f145f169fe60bdace9","category":"Cycling"}
