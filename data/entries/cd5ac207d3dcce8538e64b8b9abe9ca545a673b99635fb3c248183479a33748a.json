So you can charge four 61W MacBook Pro models all at the same time, or do a 16-inch MacBook Pro, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, and another accessory all at full charging speeds.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's a 100Wh battery so though it provides up to 245W, it can still be brought on an airplane. The Battery Pack has enough juice to charge a MacBook Pro or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> up to two times with 27,000mAh capacity.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/hyper-battery-pack-four-macbooks.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nA built-in OLED display lets you know your battery status, providing real-time battery information like charging status, capacity, time to recharge, and the power being drawn from each port.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith the 245W GaN charger or any 100W USB-C PD charger, the battery pack can be charged up in as little as an hour.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHyper is offering the new products <a href=\"https://245w.kckb.st/ef107a69\">on Indiegogo</a>, and pricing for the battery pack starts at $149, while pricing on the 245W GaN charger starts at $99.
