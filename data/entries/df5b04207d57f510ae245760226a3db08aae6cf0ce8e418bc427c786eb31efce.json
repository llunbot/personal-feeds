Today’s deal makes it a much better value: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-8%E2%80%91core-10%E2%80%91core/dp/B0CM5JV268/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro for $1,399</a>, a savings of $200 and the lowest price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest selling of the new MacBook Pro isn’t the M3 chip, which brings a nice speed boost over the prior generation. Rather it’s the new design that brings it up to speed with the higher-end models and replaces the aging 13-inch model. The main attraction is the 14-inch display, which brings ProMotion and HDR to the entry-level model for the first time. It also gets HDMI and an SD card reader, as well as MagSafe charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you’re looking for an upgrade from an older 13-inch MacBook Pro or a MacBook Air, go grab it before the price goes back up.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"df5b04207d57f510ae245760226a3db08aae6cf0ce8e418bc427c786eb31efce","category":"Apple"}
