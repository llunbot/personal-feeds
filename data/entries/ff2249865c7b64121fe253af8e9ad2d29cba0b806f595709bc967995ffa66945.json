So if you’re looking for a boilerplate solution to kickstart your project responsibly, the <a href=\"https://github.com/jbmoelker/a11y-boilerplate\">Accessibility Boilerplate</a> is for you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c78092d4-4c33-4d97-a46a-98cc0dc8253e/1-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>The template uses plain old semantic markup to correctly structure your content, making it easily accessible by search engines and assistive technologies. The HTML5 syntax is further enhanced with ARIA roles and Microdata. An oldie but goodie.</p>\n<p>In case you need a little bit of help with WAI-ARIA, this <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/accessible-snippets\">collection of accessible snippets</a> will sure come in handy. The snippets include all WAI-ARIA attributes and descriptions to help make your content more accessible. To help you resolve existing accessibility errors, Jacob Lett put together a <a href=\"https://bootstrapcreative.com/web-accessibility-evaluation-tool-code-snippets/\">collection of snippets</a> for reducing redundant title text, dealing with empty links used for JavaScript behavior, and bringing meaning to visual elements like icons.</p>\nASP.NET Boilerplate\n<p>The <a href=\"https://aspnetboilerplate.com/\">ASP.NET Boilerplate</a> uses familiar tools to provide you with a solid developer experience when building modern web applications. Based on domain-driven design, it provides a strong infrastructure and development model for modularity, multi-tenancy, caching, background jobs, data filters, setting management, domain events, unit and integration testing, and everything else you’ll need to have more time to focus on your business code. Startup templates help you get started — either with an Angular single-page application or classic MVC &amp; jQuery architecture.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f1b50e28-90cf-4585-b8be-fc7c3573b1ab/2-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>Another fully-fledged boilerplate is the <a href=\"https://codewithmukesh.com/project/aspnet-core-hero-boilerplate/\">ASP.NET Core Hero Boilerplate</a>. It enables you to run a single line of CLI on your Console to get a complete implementation. The template includes both WebAPI and MVC. A perfect starting point to learn about various essential packages and architecture.</p>\nBrowser Extensions Boilerplate\n<p>Do you plan to build a browser extension? The <a href=\"https://github.com/fstanis/webextensions-webpack-boilerplate\">Browser Extension Webpack Boilerplate</a> has got your back. Designed for creating WebExtensions API-based browser extensions using Webpack, the extensions are, in theory, compatible with Chrome, Chromium, Firefox, Firefox for Android, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. Actual compatibility will depend on the APIs you used.</p>\nModern Cross-Browser Extensions Boilerplate\n<p>Things that seem trivial in the web development world can turn out to be surprisingly hard in a web extension context. Especially when it comes to cross-browser extensions. To give you the experience you know from building cross-browser web apps when developing cross-browser web extensions, Cezar Augusto built <a href=\"https://github.com/cezaraugusto/extension-create\"><code>extension-create</code></a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c07d98ed-6836-41f5-a6ff-5009121a7b60/3-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p><code>extension-create</code> helps you develop cross-browser extensions with built-in support for module import/exports, auto-reload, and more. There’s no build configuration necessary: To create an extension, a new browser instance (for now, Chrome) will open up, and you’re ready to dive right in. Each command and major feature works as a standalone module which is particularly useful if you have your extension setup but want to benefit from specific features, such as the browser launcher with default auto-reload.</p>\nModern CSS Resets And Their Alternatives\n<p>With CSS browser compatibility issues being much less likely today, CSS resets have mostly become redundant. However, there are instances when a modern CSS reset might still make sense. Box sizing, body styles, links, fluid image styles, fonts, and a <code>@media</code> query for reduced motion, these are things you might want to reset, <a href=\"https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset\">as Andy Bell shows</a>. A modern reset of sensible defaults, so to say.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0a8e4374-a465-4ec4-917f-89c285dd72cb/4-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>Another modern alternative to CSS resets is <a href=\"https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/\">Normalize.css</a>. It normalizes styles for a wide range of elements, corrects bugs and browser inconsistencies, improves usability with subtle modifications, and it uses detailed comments to explain what code does.</p>\nCSS Boilerplates And Snippets\n<p>Are you embarking on a smaller project or do you feel that a larger framework is overkill for your needs? <a href=\"https://acahir.github.io/Barebones/\">Barebones</a> only styles a handful of standard HTML elements and CSS Grid, and, as it turns out, that’s often more than enough to get started. With its approximately 400 lines, the boilerplate is light as a feather, and there’s no compiling or installing necessary to get you started.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fcf7f136-478e-4621-b2b9-e40d4a348366/5-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.30secondsofcode.org/css/p/1\">CSS snippet collection</a> by <em>30 seconds of code</em> contains utilities and interactive examples for CSS3. Whether it’s custom checkboxes, menu overlays, or button animations, the collection has got you covered with useful snippets for layouts, styling and animating elements, and handling user interactions. <em>CodeMyUI</em> also features a collection of <a href=\"https://codemyui.com/tag/pure-css/\">pure CSS code snippets for user interfaces</a> — some of them with quite fancy effects.</p>\nColor Themes For Your Dev Environment\n<p>Have you ever wished for a streamlined color theme across your entire development environment? One that you feel is pleasant for the eyes and that stays the same when you switch from your code editor to the terminal across to Slack? <a href=\"https://themer.dev/\">themer</a> helps you achieve just that.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fc4fdf7e-d95c-4514-85e7-9d6e0cca4a04/6-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p><em>themer</em> takes a set of colors and generates themes for your development environment based on them. You can either start with a pre-built color set or create one from scratch by entering two main shades for background color and foreground text and accent colors for syntax highlighting, errors, warnings, and success messages. Once you’re happy with the result, you can download the themes you want to generate from the palette — different terminals and text editors are supported, just like Slack, Alfred, Chrome, Prism, and other tools and services. To make the color coordination complete, there are matching wallpapers based on your theme, too.</p>\nBootstrap Your Dotfiles\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot\">Dotbot</a> helps you install dotfiles with just one short command, even on a freshly installed system. It is designed to be lightweight and self-contained (no external dependencies or installation required) and can be used as a replacement for any other tool you were using to manage your dotfiles. Dotbot uses YAML or JSON-formatted configuration files to let you specify how you set your dotfiles and it knows how to link files and folders, create folders, execute shell commands, and clean directories of broken symbolic links. User plugins are supported for custom commands.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/863cb268-356a-48e2-8ab1-956334603cee/7-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to dive deeper into dotfiles, the <a href=\"https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles\">Awesome Dotfiles</a> list features helpful articles and tutorials, as well as example dotfile repos and frameworks, tools, and more.</p>\nElectron Boilerplate\n<p>A minimalist <a href=\"https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate\">boilerplate application for Electron runtime</a> comes from Jakub Szwacz. To provide you with an easy-to-understand base that you can build upon, it only includes the bare minimum of tooling and dependencies that are needed for a fully-functional Electron environment. The boilerplate doesn’t impose any front-end technologies on you, so you are free to pick your favorite.</p>\nEmergency Site Kit\n<p>In case of emergency, many organizations need a quick way to publish critical information. However, existing CMS websites are often unable of handling sudden traffic spikes and, depending on the kind of emergency, the local network infrastructure might even be damaged, leaving people with poor mobile connections out. Max Boeck’s <a href=\"https://github.com/maxboeck/emergency-site\">Emergency Site Kit</a> is here to provide people with the information they need in such cases, no matter the circumstances.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5b54b96f-4861-42b2-b63b-46b23977f6b4/8-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>The kit helps you quickly publish a simple website that is fast, accessible, and that can withstand large amounts of traffic. Built on the rule of least power, it uses simple technologies to ensure maximum resilience: The static files are optimized for first roundtrip, there’s only basic styling and one critical request, and service workers ensure offline support. One for the bookmarks.</p>\nHow To Favicon In 2021\n<p>Sometimes, it’s a good idea to re-evaluate best practices. When it comes to favicons, for example — particularly given the fact that front-end developers have to deal with more than 20 static PNG files to display a simple favicon these days. To make the process more straightforward, Andrey Sitnik came up with a smarter <a href=\"https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs\">solution that requires just five icons</a> and one JSON file to fit most modern needs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4b9d0ebf-5a21-4fac-9794-130735756183/9-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>Inspired by Andrey’s approach, Chris Coyier went even a step further and went ultra-minimalist for the CSS Tricks favicon. He explains how it works in his post “<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/how-to-favicon-in-2021/\">How to Favicon in 2021</a>”. An SVG concept to get your favicons ready for dark mode is also included.</p>\nA Boilerplate For Forms\n<p>Let’s be honest, forms can be a pain. Luckily, there’s a little HTML and CSS boilerplate to change that: <a href=\"https://boilerform.hankchizljaw.com/\">Boilerform</a>. Providing baseline BEM-structured CSS and appropriate attributes on elements, the little boilerplate gives your forms a head start.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/eaa3ebed-2954-4e65-9f59-d5c47600a119/10-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>Designed to be straightforward to implement, you can, in its most basic form, drop a CSS file into your head with a short snippet and wrap your elements in a <code>boilerform</code> wrapper. To give you more control, there’s also a Sass and Patterns Library to work with. Whether it’s a contact form, card payment, or user signup, Boilerform has got you covered.</p>\nAll-In-One Front-End Boilerplates\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/yashilanka/Modern-Web-Boilerplate\">Modern Front-End Development Boilerplate</a> is an all-in-one starter kit to develop, build, and deploy your next web project. Features include multiple front-end SCSS frameworks, an easy-to-manage folder structure, a centralized place to manage project-related settings like images, fonts, and JavaScript, hassle-free font-face generation, an integrated backup feature, and much more.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b930a5f2-5d73-4259-b46d-f48bdb6360a4/11-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>Another modern front-end boilerplate comes from the team at digital product studio tonik: the <a href=\"https://github.com/tonik/html-frontend-boilerplate\">HTML Frontend Boilerplate</a> is a modern solution for building fast, organized, and standardized web apps and sites.</p>\nGitHub Template Guidelines\n<p>No matter if it’s a private repository you share with your team or an open-source tool intended for the community: the first thing people usually see of your project is the Readme on GitHub. But what goes into the Readme that actually provides value to the user? Cezar Augusto put together <a href=\"https://github.com/cezaraugusto/github-template-guidelines\">guidelines for building GitHub templates</a>. Handy!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5d0800c1-bcef-437b-8879-7a8d3cf080c2/12-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\nCreate .gitignore Files For Your Git Repositories\n<p>Another little detail that can be automated to save you some precious time are <code>.gitignore</code> files. <a href=\"https://toptal.com/developers/gitignore\">gitignore.io</a> does exactly that. The site has a graphical and a command line method of creating <code>.gitignore</code> files for your operating system, programming language, or IDE.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5ea92811-def1-44fc-aafc-7dfcbbbfd0c9/13-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>You can either enter the system and language you want to ignore directly on the site or copy the snippet that fits your shell from the documents to create an alias and, finally, the .gitignore file with the help of the command line.</p>\nHackathon Starter\n<p>If you have ever attended a hackathon, you know how much time it takes to get a project started: Once you’ve decided what to build, you need to pick a programming language, a web framework, a CSS framework, and you need to set up an initial project that team members can contribute to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/24c59a3a-f1c1-480a-973a-ad1016191805/14-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter\">Hackathon Starter</a> is here to help you set the base for your Node.js web applications so that you can focus on what really matters: the hackathon project itself. The boilerplate features local authentication with email and password, authentication via Twitter, Facebook, Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Instagram, flash notifications, MVC project structure, account management, API examples, and much more to help you get started.</p>\nHTML Boilerplate Explained\n<p>How do you start a new project? Do you copy the HTML structure of the last site you built or maybe a boilerplate from HTML5 Boilerplate? Manuel Matuzović usually does the same, but recently, he encountered a situation where copying and pasting wasn’t an option: To document the structure he and his team are using at work, he had to understand the choices that have been made.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e7e65eee-dbc5-463b-b742-7546c6b948c6/15-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>The task took up quite some time to research, so Manuel <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/\">published the boilerplate</a> on his blog for everyone to use, along with detailed explanations for each line of code so that you know exactly what you’re dealing with. A great opportunity to dive deeper into the underlying structure of a page. </p>\nMobile-First Boilerplates\n<p>Do you need a lightweight, mobile-first boilerplate that includes only the essentials? Then Kraken might be for you. <a href=\"https://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/\">Kraken</a> is not supposed to be a finished product but rather a starting point that you can adapt to any project. The base structure is a fully-fluid, single column layout, and an object-oriented approach to CSS lets you mix, match, and reuse classes throughout a project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a770f68c-f513-4b6c-9a3a-0fb28dea45f5/16-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>Another great little helper if you feel you don’t need all the utility of larger frameworks is <a href=\"http://getskeleton.com/\">Skeleton</a>. It only styles a handful of standard HTML elements and includes a grid. The boilerplate gets by with only 400 lines and there’s no installation and zero compiling necessary to get started.</p>\nHTML5 Boilerplate\n<p>One of the most popular (if not the most popular) boilerplate to help you build fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites, is <a href=\"https://html5boilerplate.com/\">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>. It bundles up the combined knowledge and effort of 100s of developers in one little package.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4f4f2ff9-b8ce-4247-b2eb-b5bbd838ff56/17-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>What’s in it? A lean, mobile-friendly HTML template, with optimized Google Analytics snippet, a placeholder touch device icon, and docs with extra tips and tricks. The boilerplate also includes Normalize.css, a modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets, and further base styles, helpers, media queries, and print styles. Perfect to give your project a head-start.</p>\n<p>An alternative worth looking into is Igor Agapov’s <a href=\"https://moderntemplate.site/\">Modern HTML Starter Template</a> which was built with a focus on performance.</p>\nBoilerplates For Responsive HTML Emails\n<p>We all know about the challenges that come with formatting HTML emails. A handy boilerplate for sending out nicely formatted messages while avoiding some of the major pitfalls comes from Sean Powell: <a href=\"http://htmlemailboilerplate.com/\">HTML Email Boilerplate</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d529087b-bb40-4537-ba88-e0b96bb9144c/18-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>Sean’s template is available in two versions — with and without comments — and consists of a header with global styles and a body section with more specific fixes and guidance to use where needed in your design. Whether you want to create your own template based on the snippets or cherry-pick the ones that fix your specific rendering issues, the boilerplate has got you covered.</p>\n<p>Another email boilerplate worth looking into is Mark Robbins’ <a href=\"https://www.goodemailcode.com/email-code/template\">Good Email Code template</a>, a simple stripped-back template that you can use for every email you send. If you’re interested in learning why each part of the code is where it is, Mark breaks it down in more detail.</p>\n<p>Developed to help you build responsive HTML emails with confidence, the <a href=\"https://emailframe.work/\">Email Framework</a> provides you with pre-built grid options for responsive/fluid and hybrid layouts as well as with common components. The framework supports over 60 email clients and has been thoroughly tested using Litmus.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, for those occasions when all you need is a simple responsive HTML template with a clear call-to-action button, you might also want to check out <a href=\"https://github.com/leemunroe/responsive-html-email-template\">Lee Munroe’s template</a>. It’s tested on all major email clients, on mobile, desktop, and web. Happy emailing!</p>\nA Complete Guide To HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>\n<p>The head of a web page can get quite full, especially in large pages. But what do you actually need? And how to organize the head to prevent implications on performance? Josh Buchea put together a <a href=\"https://htmlhead.dev/\">handy guide</a> that dives deep into HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> elements.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/38785e23-c8bb-47d7-89d3-54840a98a714/19-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>The guide covers everything from the recommended minimum and including elements for how a document should be rendered to links and references, favicons, social media, just like browser-depended information for things like smart app banners or “add to homescreen” features. A nice bonus: The guide is available in 11 languages. One for the bookmarks.</p>\nPHP Boilerplates\n<p>If you’re looking for a simple yet powerful PHP framework with a very small footprint, <a href=\"https://codeigniter.com/\">CodeIgniter</a> has got you covered. CodeIgniter encourages MVC without forcing it on you, it has exceptional performance, and comes with built-in protection against CSRF and CSS attacks.

As the name implies, it is perfect for building a rather small website without complex code structure. Key features include easy routing, intelligent serviceworker cache, and it’s SEO-optimized, and prepared for Accelerated Mobile Pages as well as for Progressive Web Apps.</p>\nCreate Projects From Cookiecutters\n<p>A command-line utility that creates projects from cookiecutters (i.e, project templates)? <a href=\"https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter\">Cookiecutter</a> does just that. It takes a source directory tree, copies it into your new project, and replaces all the names that are surrounded by templating tags <code>{{</code> and <code>}}</code> with names it finds in cookiecutter.json. These can be file names, directory names, and strings inside files. This enables you to bootstrap a new project from a standard form, skipping all the mistakes that are often involved when starting a new project. Project templates can be in any language or markup format and you can use both local cookiecutters or remote ones from Git or Mercurial repos.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/dc7ad4c1-6ef2-4c48-a8e1-27a0fb8747fe/21-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\nQuick Snippets\n<p>Sometimes you come across a small tip that turns out to be true gold: Maybe it’s a solution to a problem you’ve been tinkering with for some time or a short code snippet that makes your workflow a lot more efficient. The site <a href=\"https://quicksnippets.dev/\">QuickSnippets</a> collects little nuggets like these.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8f09be36-81e8-4187-a3ea-5fd806cdd72f/22-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>Currently, the collection features almost 1,300 snippets by 296 authors to help you in your everyday work. The snippets cover everything from browsers, tools, and editors to CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Laravel, PHP, React, UI/UX, and Vue.js.

If you want to ship WebP already today, you’ll need a loading strategy that also providess a fallback for browsers that don’t support the new format yet. Stefan Judis <a href=\"https://www.stefanjudis.com/snippets/a-picture-element-to-load-correctly-resized-webp-images-in-html/\">shows how to do it</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/33fc1d3d-8f82-4b00-bd58-68f940bdd408/24-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits.png\" /></p>\n<p>Stefan’s solution for loading a responsive WebP image uses the <code>picture</code> element, and even though it it involves quite a lot of lines of code, it’s worth it as the snippet not only loads the image in the best format but also the best sizes.
