{"title":"Why Is Jack Smith’s Unsealed Motion, Outlining Trump’s Criminal Actions to Overturn the 2020 Election, Not the Top Story?","link":"https://politicalwire.com/2024/10/03/why-is-this-not-the-top-story/","date":1728064051000,"content":"\n<p>Taegan Goddard, writing at Political Wire:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s worth recalling that a major reason Trump won in 2016 was\nthat, just before the election, news broke about emails related to\na closed investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails being found\non Anthony Weiner’s computer, the estranged husband of a top\nClinton aide.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, nothing came of this discovery, but the extensive news\ncoverage of it <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/fbi-ignored-anthony-weiners-laptop-and-it-may-have-cost-hillary-clinton-the-election.html\">almost certainly swayed the election</a>. It\nwas the top story in every major newspaper.</p>\n\n<p>But this new evidence presented against Trump wasn’t even the lead\nstory in the <a href=\"https://d2dr22b2lm4tvw.cloudfront.net/ny_nyt/2024-10-03/front-page-large.jpg\">New York Times</a> or <a href=\"https://d2dr22b2lm4tvw.cloudfront.net/dc_wp/2024-10-03/front-page-large.jpg\">Washington Post</a>\nthis morning. And it didn’t even make the front page of the <a href=\"https://d2dr22b2lm4tvw.cloudfront.net/wsj/2024-10-03/front-page-large.jpg\">Wall\nStreet Journal</a> or <a href=\"https://d2dr22b2lm4tvw.cloudfront.net/usat/2024-10-03/front-page-large.jpg\">USA Today</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It’s true that millions of words have already been written about\nTrump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election. But there was\nplenty of new information included in this filing which is\ndirectly relevant to the biggest news story this month.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This, I think, is entirely explained by the conventional wisdom that the U.S. news media is “liberal”, a decades-long work-the-refs strategy from Republicans. The truth is the news media is effectively in the tank <em>for</em> Trump, sanewashing his literal nonsense, outright lies, and violence-inspiring hate speech against even <em>legal</em> immigrants. But our major political news media remains so hyper-focused on appearing not to favor one political side over the other that it’s completely lost sight of what ought to be their north star: the truth. If the truth favors one party over the other, so be it. That’s the job of reporting the news.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between how these same publications treated Hillary Clinton’s “but her emails” nonsense in 2016 compared to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/02/jack-smith-trump-election-brief-details-00182287\">Jack Smith’s motion this week</a> could not be more stark.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> If you prefer, imagine if a special counsel appointed by the Attorney General submitted a brief alleging any crimes at all committed by Kamala Harris. Let’s say personal tax evasion — crimes, but insignificant compared to multiple attempts to overthrow the results of the last presidential election. The major U.S. newspapers and cable channels would have covered nothing else in the days since. Yet for this brief laying out copious evidence that Trump attempted the worst crime imaginable against U.S. democracy itself, it’s relative crickets chirping and shoulder shrugs. Remember too that Trump is already <a href=\"https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/elections/2024/donald-trump-is-convicted-of-a-felony-heres-how-that-affects-the-2024-presidential-race/\">a convicted felon</a>. If Harris had been convicted of a felony this year, do you think it would be mentioned more frequently in news stories than it actually is for Trump? If you don’t, I have a bridge to sell you.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/04/why-is-smiths-motion-not-the-top-story\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"05efe45234aed6f5806db5e6accfc44f979f898e73ddd5b2a1c2e5c8d8bfa08a","category":"Tech"}
