The first stage performed more or less nominally, although about 15 percent of its engines failed during a burn of more than two minutes.</p>\n<p>The main problem occurred at stage separation, when the booster and Starship upper stage were lost in a fiery explosion.</p>\n<p>So what to make of all this?
