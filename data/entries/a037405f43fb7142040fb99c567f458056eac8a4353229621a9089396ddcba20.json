A long-time reader and subscriber <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/kind-of-missing-the-daily-telescope.1506437/\">recently mentioned</a> in the Ars Forums that they \"kind of\" missed the Daily Telescope posts that I used to write in 2023 and 2024. Although I would have preferred that everyone <em>desperately</em> missed the Daily Telescope, I appreciate the sentiment. I really do.</p>\n<p>I initially stopped writing these posts about a year ago because it just became too much to commit to writing one thing every day. I mean, I could have done it. But doing so on the daily crossed over the line from enjoyable to drudgery, and one of the best things about working for Ars is that it tends very much toward the enjoyable side. Anyway, writing one of these posts on a weekly basis feels more sustainable. I guess we'll find out!</p>\n<p>Today's image comes to you all the way from Mars. One of the most powerful tools on NASA's Perseverance rover is the WATSON camera attached to the end of the rover's robotic arm. In the fine tradition of tortured acronyms at the space agency, WATSON stands for Wide Angle Topographic Sensor for Operations and eNgineering. And because of course it is, WATSON is located on the SHERLOC (Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals) instrument. Seriously, NASA must stand for Not Another Screwball Acronym.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/tuesday-telescope-on-mars-the-rovers-take-pictures-of-robotic-arms-and-rocks/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/tuesday-telescope-on-mars-the-rovers-take-pictures-of-robotic-arms-and-rocks/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a037405f43fb7142040fb99c567f458056eac8a4353229621a9089396ddcba20","category":"Tech"}
