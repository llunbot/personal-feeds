The refurbished units are priced at $339 in Canada, down from $399 brand new.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-White-and-Midnight-Feature-Purple-Blue.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple began selling refurbished HomePod 2 units <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-refurbished-homepod-2-usa/\">in the U.S.</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-refurbished-homepod-2-select-countries/\">many other countries</a> just over a year ago, so it took a while for availability to expand to Canada.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says its refurbished HomePods undergo full functionality testing, and they are inspected, cleaned, and repackaged in a plain white box with the power cord and documentation. The refurbished HomePods are covered by Apple's limited one-year warranty policy, and they are eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe second-generation HomePod has a similar design as the original HomePod that was discontinued in 2021, but with a larger backlit touch surface, two fewer tweeters, two fewer microphones, an indoor temperature and humidity sensor, and a few other changes.
