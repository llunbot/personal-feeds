However, according to <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-archaeology/article/herding-with-the-hounds-the-game-of-fiftyeight-holes-in-the-abseron-peninsula/3D308A06C1EED64BF5BB185B9DCCFBA1\">a paper</a> published in the European Journal of Archaeology, a version of the game board found in present-day Azerbaijan might date back even earlier, suggesting that the game originated in Asia.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/archaeologists-discovered-a-4000-year-old-board-game-at-a-dig-in-oman/\">previously reported</a>, there is archaeological evidence for various kinds of <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/best-board-games-ancient-world-180974094/\">board games from all over the world</a> dating back millennia: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senet\">Senet</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehen_(game)\">Mehen</a> in ancient Egypt, for example, or a strategy game called <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludus_latrunculorum\">ludus latrunculorum</a></em> (\"game of mercenaries\") favored by Roman legions. A 4,000-year-old board discovered last year at an archaeological site in Oman's Qumayrah Valley might be a precursor to an ancient Middle Eastern game known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur\"><em>Royal Game of Ur</em></a> (or the <em>Game of Twenty Squares</em>), a two-player game that may have been one of the precursors to backgammon (or was replaced in popularity by backgammon). Like backgammon, it's essentially a race game in which players compete to see who can move all their pieces along the board before their opponent.</p>\n<p>Last year, archaeologists <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/archaeologists-find-500-year-old-board-game-carved-in-ruins-of-polish-castle/\">discovered</a> a 500-year-old game board in the ruins of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%86miel%C3%B3w_Castle\">Ćmielów Castle</a> in Poland. It was a two-person strategy board game called <em>Mill</em>, also known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men%27s_morris\"><em>Nine Men's Morris</em></a>, <em>Merels</em>, or \"cowboy checkers\" in North America. The earliest-known <em>Mill</em> game board was found carved into the roofing slabs of an Egyptian temple at Kurna, which likely predates the Common Era. Historians believe it was well-known to the Romans, who may have learned of the game through trade routes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048621#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048621&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e217403e2ad9087788b0195040ca64e32b98ad879fce3de3be7e9f4e92487861","category":"Tech"}
