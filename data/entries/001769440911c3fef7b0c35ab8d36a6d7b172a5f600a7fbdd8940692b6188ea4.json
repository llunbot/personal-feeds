{"title":"FIDO Alliance Is Working on Making Passkeys Portable Across Platforms","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/fido-alliance-portable-passkeys-across-platforms/","date":1729204499000,"content":"\n<p>Tim Hardwick, reporting for MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The FIDO Alliance is developing new specifications to enable\nsecure transfer of passkeys between different password managers\nand platforms. <a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/\">Announced on Monday</a>, the initiative is the result\nof collaboration among members of the FIDO Alliance’s Credential\nProvider Special Interest Group, including Apple, Google,\nMicrosoft, 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane, and others.</p>\n\n<p>Passkeys are an industry standard developed by the FIDO Alliance\nand the World Wide Web Consortium, and were integrated into\nApple’s ecosystem with iOS 16, iPadOS 16.1, and macOS Ventura.\nThey offer a more secure and convenient alternative to traditional\npasswords, allowing users to sign in to apps and websites in the\nsame way they unlock their devices: With a fingerprint, a face\nscan, or a passcode. Passkeys are also resistant to online attacks\nlike phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS\none-time codes.</p>\n\n<p>The draft specifications, called Credential Exchange Protocol\n(CXP) and Credential Exchange Format (CXF), will standardize the\nsecure transfer of credentials across different providers. This\naddresses a current limitation where passkeys are often tied to\nspecific ecosystems or password managers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This initiative would address one of David Heinemeier Hansson’s primary complaints about passkeys, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/17/dhh-argues-against-passkeys\">in a post I linked to</a> earlier today.</p>\n\n<p>Hardwick mentions un-phishability as an advantage of passkeys, and that’s very true. In fact, I think that was one of the primary selling points Apple emphasized when they introduced passkey support at WWDC two years ago. A scammer who gets a victim on the phone can’t trick them into revealing a passkey like they can with passwords or one-time numeric codes. But that use case is optimized for non-technical users.</p>\n\n<p>A friend texted me with another argument <em>for</em> passkeys: it’s somewhat common for websites to break password autofill. Maybe it’s deliberate, in the name of fighting bots? But whether deliberate or not, with passkeys, they <em>have</em> to work with your browser’s connected password manager. So maybe passkeys are a net win for convenience, even for technically-knowledgeable users who are unlikely to fall for phishing scams.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/17/fido-passkey-portability\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"001769440911c3fef7b0c35ab8d36a6d7b172a5f600a7fbdd8940692b6188ea4","category":"Tech"}
