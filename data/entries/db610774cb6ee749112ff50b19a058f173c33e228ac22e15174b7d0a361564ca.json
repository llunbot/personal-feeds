But on the very day we expected to get our access back,\nGoogle altered the deal.</p>\n\n<p>We were told that read-only access to Google Drive would suit our\nwriting app better than the desired read/write access. That’s\nright — read-only for a writing app.</p>\n\n<p>When we pointed out that this was not what we had, or what our\nusers wanted, Google seemed to alter the deal yet again. In order\nto get our users full access to <em>their</em> Google Drive on <em>their</em>\ndevices, we now needed to pass a yearly CASA (Cloud Application\nSecurity Assessment) audit. This requires hiring a third-party\nvendor like KPMG.</p>\n\n<p>The cost, including all internal hours, amounts to about one to\ntwo months of revenue that we would have to pay to one of Google’s\ncorporate amigos. An indie company handing over a month’s worth of\nrevenue to a “Big Four” firm like KPMG for a pretty much\nmeaningless scan. And, of course, this would be a recurring annual\nexpense. More cash for Google’s partners, while small developers\nlike us foot the bill for Android’s deeply ingrained security\nshortcomings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Developing serious productivity apps for Android sounds like fun.
