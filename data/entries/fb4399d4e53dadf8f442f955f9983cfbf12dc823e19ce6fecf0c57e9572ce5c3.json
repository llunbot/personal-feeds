Shazam will now include songs found via Music Recognition in Control Centre, Siri, and Shortcuts to your \"My Shazam Tracks\" playlist in Apple Music or Spotify.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSimply toggle \"Sync your songs\" off and on in Shazam settings to re-sync all your previously discovered songs from the Shazam app. You may need to reopen Spotify to see the playlist refreshed\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDon't forget to keep your Shazam History safe and in sync between your devices. To do this, turn on iCloud sync in Shazam Settings.</blockquote>\r<br />\nTo update songs that are synced, Apple says that users should toggle \"Sync your songs\" off and on in the Shazam app settings, a move that will re-sync all previously discovered songs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShazam can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> for free.
