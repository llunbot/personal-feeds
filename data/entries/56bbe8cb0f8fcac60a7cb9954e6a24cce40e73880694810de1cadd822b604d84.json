The 31-year-old Specialized Off-Road racer was leading the 6-day stage race when he apparently lost control and crashed just a mile from the finish line. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to support from fellow racers and the <a href=\"https://breckepic.com\" target=\"_blank\">Breck Epic</a> medical team who were on-site quickly, “Howard was airlifted to St Anthony’s in Denver where the severity of his injuries could be fully evaluated and treated. They are extensive and include damage to his back, spine, ribs, clavicle and scapula.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To support Howard, Mike McCormack, the founder of the Breck Epic has organized a gofundme to collect donations for his road to recovery. In a short time, the gofundme has already raised $54,004 of the $80,000 goal – a testament to the amazing mountain biking community.
