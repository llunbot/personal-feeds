Why not light, flexible casing with tread and rubber compound for ultra-low pressures?</strong></p><p><strong>Maxxis: </strong>This is an interesting question and topic more broadly. The question isn’t clear on what particular discipline of mountain biking we’re talking about here, but the descriptors “lightweight,” “flexible,” and “ultra-low pressures,” all seem to indicate more of the XC side of the spectrum. I would argue that at least some of our products already tick these boxes.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629.jpg\" alt=\"Maxxis aspen xc mtb\" width=\"1548\" height=\"848\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629.jpg 1548w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-297x163.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-800x438.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-120x66.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-768x421.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-1536x841.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-696x381.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-1068x585.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-767x420.jpg 767w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1548px) 100vw, 1548px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629.jpg 1548w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-297x163.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-800x438.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-120x66.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-768x421.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-1536x841.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-696x381.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-1068x585.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21101331/best-xc-mtb-tire-maxxis-aspen-6-e1624284849629-767x420.jpg 767w\"></a></p><p>Treads like our Aspen, Rekon Race, and Ikon are all available with light, flexible 120 TPI casings, and can run low pressures (depending on numerous factors like rim width, rider weight, terrain, riding style, etc.) with or without inserts.</p><p>It’s possible that performance gains could be made by designing a tire to work with an insert, but which insert? There are tons of options on the market each with their own take on what makes a “good” insert. To really see benefits, I think you’d have to take a system approach and take into account the entire wheel package, meaning the rim, the hub, the spokes, the nipples, the insert, and the tire. That would be a really cool project, but Maxxis is a rubber company so that’s where our expertise lies.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, whether or not a rider uses inserts is up to them, but in my experience most (not all, because I know someone will say something in the comments) riders would be better served by experimenting with tire pressure or using a different casing construction. Again, this all depends on what type of riding you’re doing and what performance characteristics you personally prioritize, but if you want more sidewall support add a couple of PSI to your tires or go with a sturdier construction (EXO -&gt; EXO+ -&gt; DoubleDown -&gt; Downhill).</p><div id=\"attachment_251947\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-251947\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson.jpg\" alt=\"riding with evoc trail pro 10l backpack review\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EVOC-Trail-Pro-10L-Backpack-protector-review-photo-finlay-anderson-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-251947\">I can confirm that a tire insert doesn’t always mean you can go to a lighter casing, having suffered several rear tire pinch-flats on an EXO+ tire with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/05/12/review-cushcore-pro-inserts-allow-crazy-low-tire-pressures-for-ultimate-grip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CushCore</a>; switching to the Double Down option, I’ve been puncture free ever since – Photo by Finlay Anderson.</p></div><p>Inserts can help prevent tire damage from snake bites but they do diddly for sidewall tears or punctures through the tread area which are going to be relatively more prevalent with an ultralight tire. Wrestling with an insert to fix a trail-side flat sucks and if you end up needing to remove it you’re going to have to carry a sealant-covered pool noodle out of the woods.</p><p>I have tried the ultra-light tire + insert + ultra-low pressure thing with mixed results. Climbing traction was great even with a low profile tread, but there was a ton of unnerving tire roll while cornering. To me, inserts make a lot of sense in enduro and DH race applications for the increased support and impact protection, but if you’re an average XC or trail rider they are probably overkill. Of course there are other benefits inserts provide that riders may like but I’m not convinced they overcome the downsides for a majority of riders out there.</p><p><strong>Vittoria: </strong>While it’s true that in certain types of riding you can use a lighter tire with an insert, it’s not always the case. An insert will serve to reduce the tire bottoming out, and also add to sidewall stability, but only to a point. A lighter casing will typically be more flexible, and less durable, which would reduce the ultimate protection and stability of the system.</p><div id=\"attachment_249185\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-249185\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review.jpg\" alt=\"vittoria mazza enduro tire review tread pattern muddy riding condition david cheskin credit\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-249185\">The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/06/15/vittoria-mazza-all-terrain-enduro-tire-is-truckin-w-deep-aggressive-tread-pattern-and-burly-edges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vittoria Mazza</a> is available in a single-ply Trail casing and a 2-ply Enduro casing</p></div><p>The beauty of the question is that most tire brands already make their most popular models in multiple casing options, to allow riders to do this very type of tuning. For example, a rider may use the Vittoria Enduro 2-ply casing with an insert for Enduro type riding at high speed. That same person may choose the exact same tread, but in a lighter 1-ply Trail casing, and add an insert for general Trail type riding. The same is true of XC applications, when comparing XC-Race casing vs XC casing options that have sidewall protection.</p><p><strong>WTB: </strong>Nobody makes tires specifically for use with tire inserts because tire inserts are already made specifically for tires. Product design and development tends to optimize the design of the larger component and then cater to that design with improvement through smaller/supportive components. Thinking on it a bit more, we’re wondering which aspects of tire design could be changed to further benefit tire insert usage.

Or are there technical hurdles preventing this?</strong></p><p><strong>WTB:</strong> Ultra-low pressures typically require the exact opposite when it comes to casing and tread. The lower the pressures, the thicker and more supportive of a tire is required. Primarily in the sidewall, to prevent folding. Lighter and more flexible casings would only make it worse.</p><div id=\"attachment_253157\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-253157\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE.jpg\" alt=\"BEST TIRE PRESSURE WTB VIGILANTE 29ER 2.5&quot; TOUGH HIGH GRIP\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17102539/WTB-VIGILANTE-TOUGH-HIGH-GRIP-MTB-TIRE-PRESSURE-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-253157\">WTB offer the Vigilante in a Light (single-ply) casing version and the Tough casing version, both with their High Grip compound</p></div><p>We suggest riders who run lower-than-average pressures check out our TCS Tough tires, which feature two full layers of casing from bead to bead.
