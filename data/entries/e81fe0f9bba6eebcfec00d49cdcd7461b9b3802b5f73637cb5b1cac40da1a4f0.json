In fact, Turner Bicycles seems to have hit its stride focusing on titanium bikes like the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/turner-goes-all-ti-nitrous-titanium-hardtail-adds-another-metal-bike-to-the-lineup/\" target=\"_blank\">Nitrous</a> and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-turner-cyclosys-ti-gravel-bike-remains-cyclocross-ready-but-with-bigger-tires/\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclosis Ti</a>. Now, Turner is adding another, more aggressive hardtail to the mix along with an interesting cruiser prototype. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a

of customers’ requests for a more capable Ti hardtail from Turner. Designed around a 160mm travel suspension fork and either 29 x 2.5″ or 27.5 x 2.8″ wheels and tires, the titanium frame features a low-slung top tube for increased standover height. There are also gussets on the seat tube/top tube and head tube/down tube since this bike is built to get rowdy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frame details include a 64.5º HTA and 435mm chainstays, an ISCG mount for the T47 bottom bracket shell, UDH, a 180mm post-mount rear standard, and no seat post bottle bosses – that keeps the seat tube completely open, so you can insert the longest dropper posts, or slam a long rigid post in the case you’re not running a dropper. That seat post insertion is 280mm on the Regular size, or 320mm on the Tall frame! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing and availability are TBA. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>DeWulf Prototype

that has a bit of a poignant, yet inspiring back story. The bike gets its name from Dave’s longest employee Greg Wulff. Due to some health issues, Greg hasn’t been able to ride like he used to, so they put together this beautiful titanium cruiser frame that can be run geared or single speed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The geometry is exactly the same as the Turner Nitrous Ti, and features a T47 bottom bracket, a 160mm rear brake mount that can fit up to 180mm rotors, and 27.5 x 2.8″ tires for stability. DT told us that they do have plans for production for the DeWulf cruiser, though the bike shown above is still a prototype. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://turnerbikes.com/collections/nitrous\" target=\"_blank\">turnerbikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/turner-bicycles-scrub-enduro-ti-hardtail-dewulf-cruiser-prototype/\">Turner Bicycles Adds Scrub Enduro Ti Hardtail, DeWulf Cruiser Prototype</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e81fe0f9bba6eebcfec00d49cdcd7461b9b3802b5f73637cb5b1cac40da1a4f0","category":"Cycling"}
