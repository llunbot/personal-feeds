Apple had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/apple-extra-suppliers-for-mini-led-displays/\">previously</a> only contracted SMT, or Taiwan Surface Mounting Technology as its supplier for SMT processes in the mini-LED 12.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> and the upcoming MacBook Pros.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple first introduced a mini-LED display in its high-end 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ this past April. While the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> was announced in April, shipments of the device did not begin until later in May due to high demand and difficult production yield rates. Fueled by a global chip shortage and the continued global health crisis, Apple and its suppliers have faced challenges the past year in maintaining production of new devices. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe upcoming MacBook Pros are expected to be in high demand thanks to several long-awaited features and changes. Alongside a more powerful Apple silicon chip, the new MacBook Pros are rumored to include the first major redesign to the MacBook Pro since 2016, including flat-edges, removing the Touch Bar, and additional ports. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>DigiTimes</em> says the new MacBook Pros are expected to launch in the fourth quarter of the year, which runs from October through December. The publication previously cited sources claiming an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/01/apple-macbook-pro-in-september/\">end-of-third-quarter launch for the new models</a>, but early fourth quarter is more in line with industry expectations. Apple last year announced its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Apple silicon processor and an updated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, and MacBook Pro at a digital event in November. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes/\">digitimes</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-gains-extra-mini-led-supplier/\">Apple Expecting High Demand for Upcoming MacBook Pros, Enlists Extra Mini-LED Display Supplier</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expecting-high-demand-for-upcoming-macbook-pros-enlists-extra-mini-led-display-supplier.2304086/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DXMUlI7_7QY:T7cLa4WaRMU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DXMUlI7_7QY:T7cLa4WaRMU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/DXMUlI7_7QY\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"854e6704123a13a214ba49e354085fa163b32a7727de660be46e4d50bf3d5e2d","category":"Apple"}
