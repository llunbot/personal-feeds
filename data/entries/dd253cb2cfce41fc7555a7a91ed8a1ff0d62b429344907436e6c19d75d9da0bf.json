Amazon bought the US-based firm Ring for around $1 billion in 2018.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple offers a similar service for HomeKit-enabled third-party cameras called <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit-secure-video/\">HomeKit Secure Video</a>, which leverages <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> to securely stream and store video clips from compatible indoor and outdoor cameras and doorbells, with end-to-end encryption. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit-secure-video/\">HomeKit Secure Video</a> cameras and doorbells are managed through the Home app like other <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> accessories. However, despite assurances given in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/02/27/amazon-ring-acquisition-homekit/\">2018</a> Amazon's Ring Video Doorbell still does not support Apple ‌HomeKit‌, and there is no indication that it plans to do so in the near future. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor people looking for alternatives, Apple in December began selling <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/logitech-circle-view-doorbell/\">Logitech's Circle View Wired Doorbell</a> ($200), one of the first video doorbells with support for ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nStarting with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a>, which will be publicly released in September, security cameras and video doorbells that support ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌ will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/homekit-secure-video-package-detection/\">detect and notify you when a package has been delivered</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ring/\">Ring</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/ring-doorbell-videos-encryption-no-homekit/\">Ring Video Doorbells to Gain End-to-End Encryption, But Still No Sign of HomeKit Support</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ring-video-doorbells-to-gain-end-to-end-encryption-but-still-no-sign-of-homekit-support.2304207/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fFZtDpl6wsg:wQS0VdmdKbo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fFZtDpl6wsg:wQS0VdmdKbo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/fFZtDpl6wsg\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dd253cb2cfce41fc7555a7a91ed8a1ff0d62b429344907436e6c19d75d9da0bf","category":"Apple"}
