{"title":"Genetic testing company 23andMe declares bankruptcy","link":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/genetic-testing-company-23andme-declares-bankruptcy/","date":1742828122000,"content":"<p>On Sunday, the genetic testing and heritage company 23andMe <a href=\"https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/23andme-initiates-voluntary-chapter-11-process-maximize\">announced</a> that it had entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy and was asking a court to arrange its sale. The company has been losing money for years, and a conflict between its board and CEO about future directions led to the <a href=\"https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/independent-directors-23andme-resign-board\">entire board resigning</a> back in September. Said CEO, Anne Wojcicki, has now resigned and will be pursuing an attempt to purchase the company and take it private.</p>\n<p>At stake is the fate of genetic data from the company's 15 million customers. The company has secured enough funding to continue operations while a buyer is found, and even though US law limits how genetic data can be used, the pending sale has raised significant privacy concerns.</p>\n<h2>Risky business</h2>\n<p>The company launched around the time that \"gene chips\" first allowed people to broadly scan the human genome for sites where variations were common. A few of these variants are associated with diseases, and 23andMe received approval to test for a number of these. But its big selling point for many people was the opportunity to explore their heritage. This relied on looking broadly at the patterns of variation and comparing those to the patterns typically found in different geographic regions. It's an imperfect analysis, but it can often provide a decent big-picture resolution of a person's ancestry.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/genetic-testing-company-23andme-declares-bankruptcy/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/genetic-testing-company-23andme-declares-bankruptcy/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"976fe4f4c91d01668ff7642e783408205ed7c19578fe4c7384744146e5fe8644","category":"Tech"}
