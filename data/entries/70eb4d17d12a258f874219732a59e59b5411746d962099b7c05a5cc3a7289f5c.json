Google really seems to want to be primarily an AI company now. Android already had <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-wants-ai-to-listen-to-your-phone-calls-detect-scam-callers/\">some AI news</a> yesterday, but now that the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/google-dusts-off-the-failed-google-playbook-to-fight-chatgpt/\">code-red requirements</a> have been met, we have actual OS news.</p>\n<p>One of the big features in this release is \"Private Space,\" which Google says is a place where users can \"keep sensitive apps away from prying eyes, under an additional layer of authentication.\" First, there's a new hidden-by-default portion of the app drawer that can hold these sensitive apps, and revealing that part of the app drawer requires a second round of lock-screen authentication, which can be different from the main phone lock screen.</p>\n<p>Just like \"Work\" apps, the apps in this section run on a separate profile. To the system, they are run by a separate \"user\" with separate data, which your non-private apps won't be able to see. Interestingly, Google says, \"When private space is locked by the user, the profile is paused, i.e., the apps are no longer active,\" so apps in a locked Private Space won't be able to show notifications unless you go through the second lock screen.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024211#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024211&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"70eb4d17d12a258f874219732a59e59b5411746d962099b7c05a5cc3a7289f5c","category":"Tech"}
