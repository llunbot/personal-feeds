If this new trailer is any indication, <em>Part 2</em> promises to be just as powerful.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/latest-dune-trailer-gives-us-our-best-look-yet-at-denis-villeneuves-epic-film/\">reported previously</a> (also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/needs-more-zendaya-we-have-our-first-look-at-the-new-dune-film/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/destiny-awaits-timothee-chalamet-is-the-chosen-one-in-first-dune-trailer/\">here</a>), Herbert's novel <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/aquaman-khal-drogo-actor-may-play-duncan-idaho-in-new-dune-film/\"><em>Dune</em> is set in the distant future</a> and follows the fortunes of various noble houses in what amounts to a feudal interstellar society. Much of the action takes place on the planet Arrakis, where the economy is driven largely by a rare, life-extending drug called melange (\"the spice\"). Melange also conveys a kind of prescience and makes faster-than-light travel practical. There's betrayal, a prophecy concerning a messianic figure, giant sandworms, and battle upon battle as protagonist Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) contends with rival House Harkonnen and strives to defeat the forces of Shaddam IV, Emperor of the Known Universe.</p>\n<p><em>Part 1</em>'s finale left Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), presumed dead in the harsh desert of Arrakis, having fled their home when Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) betrayed the Atreides family and killed Paul's father, Leto (Oscar Isaac). They were taken in by the Fremen, the planet's native inhabitants, who include Chani (Zendaya), a girl who had been appearing in Paul's dreams/visions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951121#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951121&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8e481ee1b0bc97f9c2dcda4e7892afed78126189d94ca8fb3e6c81f7f6471e1b","category":"Tech"}
