The range of the motor and battery is impressive – we achieved a maximum of 45.64 miles in testing.</p>\n<p>Riding the MiRide ONE is lots of fun. The head angle is upright, making handling fast and ideal for getting through tight spaces.</p>\n<p>Folding the bike is quick and it is easily manoeuvred when packed down. At 17.2kg, it does take a bit of lifting though.</p>\n<p>The singlespeed design might frustrate some riders, but if you get used to that, the ONE proves a great machine for getting around town.</p>\n<p>We’ve also tested the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/mirider-one-gb3-review/\">MiRider One GB3</a> with a planetary gearbox which scored 4 stars.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/mirider-one-2021-review/\">Read our full MiRider ONE review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Airnimal Joey Endurance Plus</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Joey Endurance Plus offers a ride closer to a road bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£2,499 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Folded dimensions:</strong> TBC</li>\n</ul><p>If you’re looking for a folding bike that offers a road-bike-like ride, this Airnimal is in a league of its own – though it certainly doesn’t come cheap.</p>\n<p>The Joey is designed to offer the ride of a bike with full-size wheels, and indeed its 26in wheels are exactly what you’d find on mountain bikes of yesterday.</p>\n<p>It’ll fold into a shape that’s suitable for public transport in around a minute, while its travel-friendly ‘case fold’ will take around 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Unlike most bikes on this list, the Joey is a genuine option for those wanting to take on serious miles, ride <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-a-sportive/\">sportives</a> or even go touring. It has got a grown-up spec with a SRAM <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrain</a> and disc brakes, meaning it’ll even venture off-road without trouble.</p>\n<p>Airnimal supports this model with a whole host of accessories, from racks and mudguards to light brackets.

We found the brakes impressive, too.</p>\n<p>The mudguards help you get to your destination with a dry bum and collapsing the bike is quick.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Brompton P Line is a practical, fast and low-weight machine.

The fork is carbon.</p>\n<p>Folding the bike is very easy – simply undo the rear quick-release lever and sweep the rear end under the front.

So consider your specific needs before you buy.</p>\n<p>The good news is that many folding bikes come with luggage racks or fixings. Other essentials such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lights-for-road-cycling/\">lights</a> are readily available, and while you might have to forgo that water <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bottle-cages/\">bottle cage</a>, that’s no great hardship for short urban journeys.</p>\n<p>Some brands, such as Brompton, even have their own range of luggage, accessories and clothing, and want you to think of the brand as a lifestyle rather than ‘just’ a mode of transport. Folding bikes certainly do cultivate a keen following.</p>\n<h3>Folding bikes are targeted by thieves</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You’ll want to lock up your bike when not in use.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Folding bikes are very popular with thieves. That said, part of their appeal is that they can be parked under your desk or wheeled into a supermarket, so they tend not to be kept outside as regularly as conventional bicycles.</p>\n<p>If you are going to keep your folder in a public place, then please use one of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lock/\">best bike locks</a>, preferably secured around both the frame and wheels, and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-best-bicycle-insurance-how-to-find-the-right-policy-for-you/\">get the bike insured</a>.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h3>How much do I need to spend?</h3>\n<p>Folding bikes can be found at nearly every price point, from a couple of hundred pounds up to the multiple thousands.</p>\n<p>It’s almost certainly a false economy to buy the cheapest one out there: the components will be lower-quality and heavier, they’ll wear out faster and your purchase is more likely to end up unloved in the shed or a skip.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, you don’t need to buy a carbon-framed wonder-bike to get something that’s light enough to carry up a flight of stairs, or convey you and your lunch to the office.</p>\n<p>Our buying guide will help explain what you should expect for your money and highlight the features commonly found at each price point.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h3>Folding bikes under £500 / $650 / AU$850</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Folding bikes don’t need to cost the earth.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p>Simplicity is your watchword at this price point. Avoid elaborate folding mechanisms with lots of moving parts that can go wrong and don’t be tempted by fancy features such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">disc brakes</a> or suspension forks. These will usually mean cost savings have been made elsewhere.</p>\n<p>If you live in a hilly city, then you can still find models with more than one gear at this price point. Conventional derailleur gears and internal hub gears are common, with the latter often requiring less maintenance, albeit at the expense of a little more weight.</p>\n<p>Rim or V-brakes are commonplace here and they are fine. They may lack the outright stopping power of disc brakes, but if the right ones are chosen they’ll provide many, many miles of hassle-free riding.</p>\n<p>Watch out for cheap saddles and tyres that are prone to puncturing.</p>\n<h3>Folding bikes under £1,000 / $1,300 / AU$1,700</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s worth checking the way in which the bike folds is suitable for your needs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Brompton</i></span></div>\n<p>As you move up in price, folding bikes begin to hit the sweet spot of ride quality, portability and longevity.</p>\n<p>If you’re using a train on your daily commute, then you’ll likely be folding and unfolding it a lot. So the components need to be up to the job and the ride quality should be good enough to give confidence on busy city streets.</p>\n<p>The components used on bikes in this price bracket will usually be vastly superior to entry-level bikes. Expect quality contact points (that’s the grips, saddle and pedals) and tyres with impressive puncture resistance and comfort.</p>\n<h3>Folding bikes over £1,000 / $1,300 / AU$1,700</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bromptons tend to start just over the £1,000 mark.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Now we’re getting into the realm of money-no-object components and materials. Look out for disc brakes, carbon frames, suspension and slick gearing. Some even have drop bars like a ‘proper’ road bike.</p>\n<p>At this price point, folding bikes tend to become more specialised; you’ll see fast, lightweight bikes designed for road riding, chunkier options that can actually be ridden off-road, and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-touring-bike-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you/\">touring bikes</a> that don’t leave you swearing in the back of beyond after a few hundred miles.</p>\n<p>The fact these bikes fold down can be considered a bonus rather than their primary function. They’re usually aimed more at riders focused on a particular discipline who want to travel often or store their bike more easily, rather than the commuter end of the market.</p>\n<h3>Which folding bike should I buy?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The key thing to work out is what you will use it for.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Joseph Branston / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Folding bikes have come a long way in the past couple of decades, with the best ones capable of becoming a reliable four-season friend. The key to picking the right one is identifying what you’ll use it for and how far you plan to ride it, and then spending accordingly.</p>\n<p>The smaller-wheeled versions suit shorter journeys best, but that’s certainly not to knock them: their ride quality can be very impressive.</p>\n<p>Larger-wheeled choices offer a more familiar ‘feel’, but they can’t be as easily collapsed into a small package or stowed away on a busy train or bus.</p>","author":"Oli Woodman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"8ce872f0836f988bf6e666c8850508221506c00ee1e81392b3874cbde3bd0a41","category":"Cycling"}
