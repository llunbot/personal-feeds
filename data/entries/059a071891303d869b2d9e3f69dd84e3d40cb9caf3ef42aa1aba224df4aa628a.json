There are still 18 more Atlas V flights on ULA's launch schedule—all are reserved by customers—primarily carrying satellites for Amazon's Kuiper broadband network and launching astronauts on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/08/starliner-undergoing-three-independent-investigations-as-flight-slips-to-2024/\">Boeing's long-delayed Starliner crew capsule</a>.</p>\n<p>ULA, a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, has several Atlas V rockets in storage at Cape Canaveral. Customer delays are the main reason ULA hasn't launched any Atlas V rockets since last November. At one point, Boeing's Starliner crew capsule was supposed to launch with astronauts for the first time on top of an Atlas V rocket earlier this year, but that test flight is now delayed into 2024. Another US Space Force mission has also been delayed for months and now likely won't fly until early 2024.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966921#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966921&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"059a071891303d869b2d9e3f69dd84e3d40cb9caf3ef42aa1aba224df4aa628a","category":"Tech"}
