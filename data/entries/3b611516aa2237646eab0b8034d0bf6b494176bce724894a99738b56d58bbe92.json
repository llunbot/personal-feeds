What started as a bike-messenger #partybrand became the #gravelbrand. All-City’s catalog over the years included cantilever bikes, disc brakes, steel frames, steel forks, carbon forks, fat tires, skinny tires, flat bars, drop bars, and snazzy paint jobs. Whether inspired by some of the most <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-2017-mr-pink-has-a-carbon-fork/\" target=\"_blank\">iconic road racing teams</a> or those wild 1990s paint jobs, All-City produced some of the best paint designs out of any mass-produced bike brand.</p>\n<p>As a final departure gift to its fans, All-City launched the last new product last year. The Cosmic Stallion Titanium ($3,299) represents one of those iconic paint jobs. A purple to blue ombre fade with a sparkle clear coat, sprayed over the frame with sharp chevrons exposing raw titanium. When I got this bike to use on this homage piece–<a href=\"https://theradavist.com/a-high-desert-look-at-the-all-city-cycles-gorilla-monsoon/\" target=\"_blank\">in the spirit of the old All-City product announcements</a> I used to do here at The Radavist–it struck me as one of the nicest-looking bikes the brand has produced.</p>\n<p><em>The Cosmic Stallion Titanium feels like All-City is in its final form, reaching immortality.</em></p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-4.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-4.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-4.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-4.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>These titanium frames are made in Taiwan at a factory long used by QBP brands.

The Cosmic Stallion Titanium is the final new product launch for All-City and a lot of emotional energy went into it.</p>\n<p>When I started digging into this piece, I had a conversation with Tim Simundza from QBP to clarify some points:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“This (All-City Cycles Cosmic Stallion Titanium) is our last NEW product launch. We will have (replenishment) products showing up at retailers over the next 12-18 months, and then once retailers sell out, we’ll (QBP) will be around for any and all warranty related items.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>That means these Cosmic Stallion Titanium frames are the last new products to be released under the All-City banner.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-18.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-18.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-18.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-18.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-17.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-17.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-17.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-17.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Final words like this about a brand that blossomed along with The Radavist over the past fifteen years made me sad. Just like that, a metal bike brand had closed. I’m not exaggerating when I say that my heart was broken. All-City brought a fun vibe to the bike industry that consistently feels like it misses the point. It brought community, a loyal fanbase, and bikes that will last for decades to come.</p>\n<p><em>Sure, Fast is Forever, but All-City encouraged riders of all pedigrees to simply enjoy riding bikes. It’s perhaps this point that made me so wrought over the announcement.</em></p>\n<p>The bike industry often perpetuates this notion that we, cyclists, have to look and ride like professional athletes. So, anytime there is a brand that embraces slow miles and gettin’ weird in the woods, it gives me hope. Hope that people will throw their legs around a bike for the first time, fall in love with the freedom it provides, and simply enjoy the unique scale of movement it offers.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-0.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-0.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-0.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-0.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titanium-Review-0.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Was I mourning?

Our jobs were to play, and design bikes, the kind of bikes we always wished existed, and the joy that came from that absurdity seldom left us. Better yet, the rate at which we met amazing human beings was absolutely astounding, from the riders, to the bike shop folks, to our international distributors, we were given a worldwide welcome and were allowed to feel at home no matter where we traveled.</p>\n<p>I was lucky enough to be part of the team at All-City for the first eleven years, and without a trace of irony, I can honestly say that it was a dream come true. I will always be incredibly proud of the things that the team at All-City accomplished during that tenure. We used the resources available as part of a large corporation to support the non-traditional cycling community and built one of the more inclusive and interesting brands in the industry. We made some classic bikes too.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly to the work, we always tried as hard as we could and consistently prioritized what was right instead of what was easy. That’s a heck of a legacy in my book.   Cheers to my teammates, the dealers, bicycle media, and the riders. Thank you for the love and support over the years, you were always the best part.</p>\n<p>Rest easy old friend, you will be reborn in legend.</p>\n<p>Jeff Frane – All-City (2008 – 2019)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>From everyone at The Radavist, we’d like to celebrate what a bicycle brand achieved in fifteen years.
