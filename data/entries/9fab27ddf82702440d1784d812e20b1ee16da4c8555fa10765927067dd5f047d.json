Users can also create new email addresses after they have finished setting up the domain with iCloud, according to Apple. Note that any custom email addresses must not be in use with another Apple ID.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/icloud-custom-email-domain.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFor those who missed the announcement back at WWDC in June, iCloud+ is Apple's new branding for <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238\">paid iCloud storage</a> combined with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-icloud-with-private-relay-more/\">new features like iCloud Private Relay and Hide My Email</a>. iCloud+ features are included with iCloud storage plans at no additional cost, with prices remaining set at $0.99 per month for 50GB of storage, $2.99 per month for 200GB of storage, or $9.99 per month for 2TB of storage in the United States.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ability to use a custom email address for iCloud is not to be confused with Hide My Email, a separate iCloud+ feature that allows users to create unique, random email addresses that forward to their personal inbox so they can send and receive email without having to share their real email address.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tommarmstrong/status/1430313913736830980\">Tommaso Armstrong</a>!)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134\">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/icloud-custom-email-domain-feature-in-beta/\">iCloud+'s New Custom Email Domain Feature Now Available in Beta</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/icloud-s-new-custom-email-domain-feature-now-available-in-beta.2308628/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_AuUGZye9bY:E5QbiTzxocw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_AuUGZye9bY:E5QbiTzxocw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/_AuUGZye9bY\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9fab27ddf82702440d1784d812e20b1ee16da4c8555fa10765927067dd5f047d","category":"Apple"}
