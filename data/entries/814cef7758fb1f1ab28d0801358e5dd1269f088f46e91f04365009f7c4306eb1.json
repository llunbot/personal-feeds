{"title":"iPhone 15 Pro Leak Reveals Unified Volume Button and Mute Button","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/iphone-15-volume-mute-buttons-cad/","date":1679326418000,"content":"As <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-15-pro-solid-state-volume-rocker/\">previously rumored</a>, the next-generation iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will feature a unified volume button and a mute button, according to leaked CAD images <a href=\"https://www.douyin.com/user/MS4wLjABAAAAJfy8r2bafpYr05KfpXyYbxq50sslCzNfF1sbDCiIS-0?modal_id=7212542528560631100\">shared in a video</a> on the Chinese version of TikTok and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1637837336158560256\">posted to Twitter by ShrimpApplePro</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-15-Pro-Buttons-CAD-Leak.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"895\" />\r<br />\nInstead of separate buttons for volume up and volume down, the iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to have a single elongated button for adjusting the volume. Meanwhile, the mute switch that has been present ever since the original iPhone in 2007 is expected to become a mute button that can be pressed to turn the iPhone's ringer on or off.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth the volume and mute buttons are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/28/kuo-iphone-15-pro-models-solid-state-buttons/\">rumored to have a solid-state design</a>. Instead of physically moving, the buttons would provide haptic feedback from two additional Taptic Engines inside the iPhone to simulate the feeling of movement, similar to the Home button on the latest iPhone SE or the Force Touch trackpad on modern MacBooks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models are still expected to have two physical volume buttons and a mute switch, as other CAD images in the video show. Apple should announce the entire iPhone 15 series in September as usual.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn related news, tech reviewer <a href=\"https://sonnydickson.com/\">Sonny Dickson</a> has provided an additional look at alleged front glass panels for the iPhone 15 series. Like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/05/iphone-15-pro-front-glass-leak/\">original leak</a>, the images show that the Pro models will have thinner bezels around the display, and that the Dynamic Island will be expanded to the standard iPhone 15 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://t.co/VKDsduZh8Z\">pic.twitter.com/VKDsduZh8Z</a></p>â€” Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SonnyDickson/status/1637707463406526464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 20, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shrimpapplepro/\">ShrimpApplePro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/iphone-15-volume-mute-buttons-cad/\">iPhone 15 Pro Leak Reveals Unified Volume Button and Mute Button</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-leak-reveals-unified-volume-button-and-mute-button.2384212/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"814cef7758fb1f1ab28d0801358e5dd1269f088f46e91f04365009f7c4306eb1","category":"Apple"}
