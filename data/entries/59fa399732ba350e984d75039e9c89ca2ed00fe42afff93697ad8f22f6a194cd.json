Kuo says the new ‌iPhone SE‌, which has marketed well for customers looking for smaller handsets, will be the \"cheapest 5G phone ever\" and is hoped to bolster Apple's position in the increasingly competitive 5G market. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPhone SE‌ was originally released in March of 2016 as a small entry-level ‌iPhone‌ to replace the ‌iPhone‌ 5S, released three years earlier. Apple updated the ‌iPhone‌ for the first time in April of last year with the A13 Bionic processor borrowed from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a>, a larger screen, a new design, and improved cameras. According to reports, the upcoming ‌iPhone SE‌ 3 will sport fewer changes, featuring only the improved A14 Bionic processor and 5G. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPhone SE‌ is the only ‌iPhone‌ within Apple's current lineup that features a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> sensor and a Home Button, and that design will continue with the ‌iPhone SE‌ 3 next year, according to <em>DigiTimes</em> and ‌Ming-Chi Kuo‌. Looking further out, Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/01/iphone-se-2023-hole-punch-design/\">reportedly planning to redesign the iPhone SE</a> with a punch-hole screen design rather than a notch in 2023. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE 2020</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes/\">digitimes</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/19/iphone-se-3-a14-bionic-5g-in-2022/\">'iPhone SE 3' With A14 Bionic Chip and 5G Expected in First Half of 2022</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-3-with-a14-bionic-chip-and-5g-expected-in-first-half-of-2022.2304721/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CqCxP1N3B0s:NA61n_1Z_xg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CqCxP1N3B0s:NA61n_1Z_xg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/CqCxP1N3B0s\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"59fa399732ba350e984d75039e9c89ca2ed00fe42afff93697ad8f22f6a194cd","category":"Apple"}
