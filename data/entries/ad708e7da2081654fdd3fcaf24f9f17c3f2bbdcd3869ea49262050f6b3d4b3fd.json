When it comes to the most interesting models this year, there were two noteworthy themes.</p>\n<p>First of all, my complaint in 2022 about there <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/oled-monitor-selection-is-pathetic-2023-can-change-that/\">not being enough OLED monitors</a> was largely addressed this year. CES revealed many plans for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/why-oled-monitor-burn-in-isnt-a-huge-problem-anymore/\">OLED monitors</a> in 2024, with a good number of those screens set to be appropriately sized for desktops. That includes the introduction of 32-inch, non-curved <a href=\"https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1704738600\">QD-OLED options</a> and other smaller screens for people who have been waiting for OLED monitors in more varied form factors.</p>\n<p>Secondly, with more people blending their work and home lives these days, CES brought hints that the line between gaming monitors and premium monitors used for general or even professional purposes will be blurring more in the future. We're not at the point where the best productivity monitor and ideal gaming monitor perfectly align in a single product. But this week's announcements have me imagining ways that future monitorsÂ could better serve users with serious work <em>and</em> play interests.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995280#p3\">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995280&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ad708e7da2081654fdd3fcaf24f9f17c3f2bbdcd3869ea49262050f6b3d4b3fd","category":"Tech"}
