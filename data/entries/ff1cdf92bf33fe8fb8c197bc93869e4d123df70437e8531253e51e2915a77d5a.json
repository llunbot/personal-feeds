These payments to Apple, users alleged, have \"stunted innovation\" and \"deprived\" users of \"quality, service, and privacy that they otherwise would have enjoyed but for Google’s anticompetitive conduct.\" They also allege that it created a world where users have fewer choices, enabling Google to prefer its own advertisers, which users said caused an \"annoying and damaging distortion\" of search results.</p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Arcell-v-Google-Order-on-Motion-to-Dismiss-2-5-2024.pdf\">order</a> granting the tech companies' motion to dismiss, US District Judge Rita Lin said that users did not present enough evidence to support claims for relief. Lin dismissed some claims with prejudice but gave leave to amend others, allowing users another chance to keep their case—now twice-dismissed—at least partially alive.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001666#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001666&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ff1cdf92bf33fe8fb8c197bc93869e4d123df70437e8531253e51e2915a77d5a","category":"Tech"}
