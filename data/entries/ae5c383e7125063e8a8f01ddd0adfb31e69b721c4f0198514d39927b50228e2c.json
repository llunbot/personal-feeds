Unlike a lot of moons around Jupiter and Saturn, which have surface ice or subsurface water, Io is a very dry world. It is also extremely geologically active. Io has more than 400 active volcanoes and is therefore an object of great interest to astronomers and planetary scientists.</p>\n<p>Images from the December 30 flyby were <a href=\"https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing?source=junocam&amp;phases%5B%5D=PERIJOVE+57\">posted by NASA</a> over the New Year holiday weekend, and they provide some of the clearest views yet of this hell-hole world. The new data will help planetary scientists determine how often these volcanoes erupt and how this activity is connected to Jupiter's magnetosphereâ€”Io is bathed in intense radiation from the gas-giant planet.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993132#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993132&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ae5c383e7125063e8a8f01ddd0adfb31e69b721c4f0198514d39927b50228e2c","category":"Tech"}
