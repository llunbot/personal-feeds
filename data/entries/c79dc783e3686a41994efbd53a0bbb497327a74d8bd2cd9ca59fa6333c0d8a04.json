{"title":"Apple Patent Offers Sketch of Possible Notch Implementation in New MacBook Pros","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/17/apple-patent-notch-design-macbook-pro/","date":1634460580000,"content":"Following the last-minute rumor that Apple's upcoming new MacBook Pro models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/15/new-macbook-pro-could-have-a-notch/\">could feature a notch at the top of the display</a>, much of the online discussion has involved concerns that such a notch would encroach on the active screen area, potentially eating into the macOS menu bar.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/MacBook-Pro-Notch-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, it's worth noting that Apple has explored ways of including a notch in a MacBook Pro display that would avoid ingression into the main screen area, make the notch appear seamless against a black strip, and potentially allow for additional information to be displayed to the user that would also free up menu bar space in the main 16:10 display.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, an Apple patent filed in 2019 with the U.S. patent office, titled <a href=\"https://uspto.report/patent/app/20190043452?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_ev50J7mKqZssGuMQbwakW6RhHCcntOo.TRMw1usenUc-1634448919-0-gqNtZGzNAlCjcnBszQe9#D00004\">\"Electronic Device Display With Extended Active Area</a>,\" describes, among various embodiments, a laptop computer featuring a main rectangular screen and two \"extended regions\" between the screen and an inactive border, wherein \"the first and second rectangular extended regions are on opposing sides of the camera.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSpecifically, the laptop's \"first and second rectangular extended regions display icons on a black background while the main rectangular region displays a rectangular picture.\"\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>\"The first and second extended regions may be located on opposing sides of a camera or other electrical component in a protruding portion or island-shaped portion of the inactive region. Icons or other information may be displayed on a black background in the extended regions, giving the display a continuous unbroken appearance.\"</blockquote>Such an implementation would of course require a significant adjustment to the way the menu bar operates on these new Mac models in the final release of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a>, and there's been no evidence of that so far. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe notch rumor, while seemingly sketchy on its own, has gained some traction since Friday, initially due to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/macbook-pro-2021-resolutions/\">discovery by <em>MacRumors</em> of screen resolutions</a> that will feature in the redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta, <em>MacRumors</em> uncovered potential display resolutions of 3024x1964 and 3456x2234 for the rumored 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models. When subtracting 74 pixels from the height of both, the resulting 3024x1890 and 3456x2160 resolutions work out to an aspect ratio of 16:10. All of Apple's current MacBooks feature a 16:10 aspect ratio, leading to speculation that the extra 74 pixels could be for a notch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe possibility that Friday's rumor may have substance to it has further been bolstered by an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/16/macbook-pro-notch-alleged-photo/\">alleged photo of a MacBook Pro screen with a notch</a> that was originally shared by a Weibo account. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/12/apple-event-unleashed-october-18/\">hosting a virtual event on Monday</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time, with rumors widely suggesting the event will be focused on redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with a faster version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip, brighter mini-LED displays, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a>, and additional connectivity.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent/\">patent</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/17/apple-patent-notch-design-macbook-pro/\">Apple Patent Offers Sketch of Possible Notch Implementation in New MacBook Pros</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-patent-offers-sketch-of-possible-notch-implementation-in-new-macbook-pros.2317339/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BFEHrFAXyXk:gUx7kOoVvIo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BFEHrFAXyXk:gUx7kOoVvIo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/BFEHrFAXyXk\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c79dc783e3686a41994efbd53a0bbb497327a74d8bd2cd9ca59fa6333c0d8a04","category":"Apple"}
