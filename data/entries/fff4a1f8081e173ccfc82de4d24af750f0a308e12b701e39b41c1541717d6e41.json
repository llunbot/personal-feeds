Today’s deal will help bring your desk anywhere you go: This 6-in-1 Baseus power strip has everything you need, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRHNCBFY\">Amazon is selling it for $50 right now</a>, half off its MSRP and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This power strip gives you access to two AC outlets, two Type-C, and two Type-A ports, thus making it possible to charge pretty much every device you have and then some. For fast-charging, it can reach 100W power through the two Type-C ports, or you can use multiple ports for slower speeds. But it still has enough juice to fast-charge your MacBook Air and iPhone at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Baseus device isn’t just going to be a great pick for traveling, but also for your home office. You can easily plug in your monitors and your laptop in one go, and charge an iPhone and Apple Watch while you’re at it. Since this is a GaN charger, it’s a lot more compact than a regular model would be, and it comes with protections against overheating or short circuits. The fact that it’s so compact will make it easy to pack on long trips, leaving those heavy power bricks at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go grab <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRHNCBFY\">the Baseus power strip for half-off</a> right now, the best time to add it to your cart over at Amazon.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get a 6-in-1 Baseus power strip for $50</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRHNCBFY\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fff4a1f8081e173ccfc82de4d24af750f0a308e12b701e39b41c1541717d6e41","category":"Apple"}
