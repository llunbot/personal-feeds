Belkin <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/04/belkin-ces-2023-environmental-update/\">in January announced plans</a> to transition to more environmentally friendly material for its products, and the launch of the hub is part of that effort.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/belkin-usb-c-hub.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe Connect 4-Port USB-C Hub is made from 72 percent PCR in its product housing, a transition that was made without impacting the quality or the safety of the accessory. Made to be compact, the hub includes four USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports, and it supports pass-through charging of up to 100W. USB-C headphones and speakers are supported, and it works with Apple's Macs and iPads.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBelkin says that its new USB-C hub is the only hub on the market able to deliver a maximum of 10Gb/s, which is 2x faster than other available hubs. It's also using Fast Role Swap (FRS) in an effort to prevent data loss and interruption of device connections when adding or removing a power source from the hub.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBelkin's Connect 4-Port USB-C Hub is priced at $52 and it can be purchased <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBelkin-Connect-Multiport-Transfer-Chromebook%2Fdp%2FB0BY27XSJ3\">from Amazon</a>.
