{"title":"Ryzen 9 9950X3D review: AMD irons out nearly every single downside of 3D V-Cache","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/ryzen-9-9950x3d-review-seriously-fast-if-a-step-backward-in-efficiency/","date":1741698048000,"content":"<p>Even three years later, AMD's high-end X3D-series processors still aren't a thing that most people need to spend extra money on—under all but a handful of circumstances, your GPU will be the limiting factor when you're running games, and few non-game apps benefit from the extra 64MB chunk of L3 cache that is the processors' calling card. They've been a reasonably popular way for people with old AM4 motherboards to extend the life of their gaming PCs, but for AM5 builds, a regular Zen 4 or Zen 5 CPU will not bottleneck modern graphics cards most of the time.</p>\n<p>But high-end PC building isn't always about what's rational, and people spending $2,000 or more to stick a GeForce RTX 5090 into their systems probably won't worry that much about spending a couple hundred extra dollars to get the fastest CPU they can get. That's the audience for the new Ryzen 9 9950X3D, a 16-core, Zen 5-based, $699 monster of a processor that AMD begins selling tomorrow.</p>\n<p>If you're <em>only</em> worried about game performance (and if you can find one), the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the superior choice, for reasons that will become apparent once we start looking at charts. But if you want fast game performance <em>and</em> you need as many CPU cores as you can get for other streaming or video production or rendering work, the 9950X3D is there for you. (It's a little funny to me that this a chip made almost precisely for the workload of the PC building tech YouTubers who will be reviewing it.)  It's also a processor that Intel doesn't have any kind of answer to.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/ryzen-9-9950x3d-review-seriously-fast-if-a-step-backward-in-efficiency/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/ryzen-9-9950x3d-review-seriously-fast-if-a-step-backward-in-efficiency/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d5ded5012a043f519ec9ee06f33776a4e1be6451042e45e9d41693f69995fff0","category":"Tech"}
