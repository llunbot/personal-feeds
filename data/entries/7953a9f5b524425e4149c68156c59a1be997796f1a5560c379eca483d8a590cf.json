Smoothing those spikes in tension, Rimpact says their Chain Damper delivers “<em>a silent and calmed ride characteristic that lets the rider focus in on subtle suspension movements and the sound of tyres[sic] gripping the dirt</em>“. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_whats-inside-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_whats-inside-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rimpact Chain Damper inside direct mount mountain bike chainring, what's inside?\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_whats-inside-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_whats-inside-297x248.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_whats-inside-1536x1280.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_whats-inside-120x100.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_whats-inside-768x640.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So you get smoother suspension and a quieter ride? What more could a mountain biker ask for!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why do you want or need to damp your chain in the first place? </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_riding-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_riding-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rimpact Chain Damper inside direct mount mountain bike chainring, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_riding-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_riding-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_riding-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_riding-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_riding-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, on most full suspension bikes, as the bike moves through its travel chain length changes – most often increasing. So as you stand on your pedals, the tension in the chain between your chainring and cassette keeps the bike’s suspension from moving smoothly. By detaching your chainring from your feet slightly, the chainring can rock back and forth when you are standing flat on the pedals descending through rough sections, allowing smoother suspension action. The same effect is there to a lesser extent when pedaling through chunky sections of trail, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, as you quickly hit sharp edged bumps your chain simply bounces around above and below your chainstay. It’s the reason we modern mountain bikers all ride clutched derailleurs these days. But that can really only be managed on the bottom loop of chain between the derailleur &amp; chainring. So Rimpact’s Chain Damper chainring will damp that movement on the top of the chain, preventing chainslap, and seriously quieting your ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-MTB-chainring_2D-Animation-optimized.gif\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-MTB-chainring_2D-Animation-optimized.gif\" alt=\"Rimpact Chain Damper inside direct mount mountain bike chainring, animation\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Animation by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mtbprogress/\" target=\"_blank\">Theo Charrier</a>/Rimpact)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“A chain weighs around 260 grams on average and the top part of your chain, (the length between the chain ring and cassette) can move at 8 meters per second, completely uncontrolled. Clutch derailleurs offer some amount of control to the lower part of your chain but the top remains free to flail wildly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here at Rimpact, we think the significant effect of this uncontrolled chain energy plays a bigger part in unwanted ride characteristics than other sources of negative drivetrain feedback.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A damped chainring means a smoother feel, better rear wheel grip on the ground, and a quieter ride in the end, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_direct-mount-detail-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1350\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_direct-mount-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rimpact Chain Damper inside direct mount mountain bike chainring, direct mount detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_direct-mount-detail-jpg.webp 1350w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_direct-mount-detail-297x176.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_direct-mount-detail-120x71.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_direct-mount-detail-768x455.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>direct mount compatible with Shimano MTB, SRAM 3-bolt X-Sync &amp; SRAM T-Type 8-Bolt crankarms</li>\n\n\n\n<li>CNC-machined 7075-T6 hard anodized narrow-wide chainrings available in 30, 32, 43 &amp; 36T sizes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>11 &amp; 12-speed compatible, including SRAM T-type compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_seals-springs-elastomers-detail-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_seals-springs-elastomers-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rimpact Chain Damper inside direct mount mountain bike chainring, tech details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_seals-springs-elastomers-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_seals-springs-elastomers-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_seals-springs-elastomers-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_seals-springs-elastomers-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_seals-springs-elastomers-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_seals-springs-elastomers-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Rimpact-Chain-Damper-inside-direct-mount-mountain-bike-chainring_seals-springs-elastomers-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2 stiff internal springs capture and return the energy from your chain</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2 internal elastomers limit rotation to +/-5° and damp the energy return</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 main IGUS bushing handles rotation and 4 thrust bushings handle alignment between the chainring &amp; Chain Damper spider</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2 X-ring seals between the fixed spider and rotating chainring keep water &amp; dirt out, and are “<em>designed to survive UK winters</em>“</li>\n\n\n\n<li>total system weight 230g (140g for the Chain Damper spider, plus 82g for the 32T chainring with its bushing.
