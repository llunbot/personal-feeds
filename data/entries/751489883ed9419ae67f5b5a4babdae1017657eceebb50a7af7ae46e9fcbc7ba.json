You slip a pedal, or catch your leg with the pedal while walking your bike – leaving tell-tale bite marks on your shin. You could be more careful, <em>or</em> you could apparently just slap some closed-cell foam pedals on your ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Intrinsic-Bumper-foam-bike-pedals-soft-touch-grip-tape1-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"695\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Intrinsic-Bumper-foam-bike-pedals-soft-touch-grip-tape1-1.png\" alt=\"Intrinsic foam pedal dimensions\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Intrinsic-Bumper-foam-bike-pedals-soft-touch-grip-tape1-1.png 695w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Intrinsic-Bumper-foam-bike-pedals-soft-touch-grip-tape1-1-297x167.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Intrinsic-Bumper-foam-bike-pedals-soft-touch-grip-tape1-1-120x67.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Intrinsic-Bumper-foam-bike-pedals-soft-touch-grip-tape1-1-400x225.png 400w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Created by Intrinsic Cycles, the Bumper Pedal is exactly that. Starting with a traditional steel pedal axle with either 1/2″ or 9/16″ threading, the pedal bodies are then encased in closed-cell foam to make them soft to the touch. That is said to make them the “safest pedal in the world” that won’t damage your shins, doorways, car interiors, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Intrinsic-Bumper-foam-bike-pedals-soft-touch-grip-tape3-e1686592296592.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1164\" height=\"677\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Intrinsic-Bumper-foam-bike-pedals-soft-touch-grip-tape3-e1686592296592.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Intrinsic-Bumper-foam-bike-pedals-soft-touch-grip-tape3-e1686592296592.jpeg 1164w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Intrinsic-Bumper-foam-bike-pedals-soft-touch-grip-tape3-e1686592296592-297x173.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Intrinsic-Bumper-foam-bike-pedals-soft-touch-grip-tape3-e1686592296592-800x465.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Intrinsic-Bumper-foam-bike-pedals-soft-touch-grip-tape3-e1686592296592-120x70.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Intrinsic-Bumper-foam-bike-pedals-soft-touch-grip-tape3-e1686592296592-768x447.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What about grip? The company claims that the pedals offer all the grip you need thanks to the Jessup brand grip tape applied to both sides of the pedals (sort of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/moto-pedals-ultra-flat-shin-friendly-made-of-wood/\" target=\"_blank\">like these wooden pedals</a>, but even more shin-friendly). Even with the grippiest grip tape in the world, these aren’t going to provide the same level of grip as a premium pair of flat pedals, but for many casual riders, it seems like it could be plenty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently offered only through an IndieGogo campaign (that is already fully funded), pairs of Bumper Pedals start at $45 and are estimated to ship in July 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bumper-pedal-the-most-comfortable-bike-pedal-ever?fbclid=IwAR2UPLbNCnFI36flW7OZH4QxO4h1Z36h5c4vpjVtX_ZXNMPNfyio4gFN3iU#/\" target=\"_blank\">indiegogo.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/foam-bike-pedals-shin-friendly-grippy-in-all-weather/\">These Foam Bike Pedals Promise to Be Shin-Friendly, Yet Grippy in All Weather?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"751489883ed9419ae67f5b5a4babdae1017657eceebb50a7af7ae46e9fcbc7ba","category":"Cycling"}
