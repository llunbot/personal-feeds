If that's how you feel, you might find \"Google Play's next chapter\" a bit bewildering, as Google hopes to make it \"more than a store.\" Or you might start thinking about how to turn Play Points into a future Pixel phone.</p>\n<div><div></div><p>Google Play's \"new way to Play.\" </p></div>\n<p>In a blog post about \"<a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-play/google-play-july-2024-new-updates/\">How we're evolving Google Play</a>,\" VP and General Manager of Google Play Sam Bright outlines the big changes to Google Play:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google/howplayworks/the-latest/?section=latest-drawer&amp;content=latest-2024-q1\">AI-generated</a> app reviews and summaries, along with app comparisons</li>\n<li>\"Curated spaces\" for interests, showing content from apps related to one thing (like <a href=\"https://play.google/howplayworks/the-latest/?section=latest-drawer&amp;content=latest-2024-q1#:~:text=Cricket%20takeover%3A%20Experimenting%20with%20immersive%20content\">cricket</a>, and Japanese comics)</li>\n<li>Game recommendations based on genres and features you select.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/google-play-games-beta-now-on-windows-desktops-if-thats-your-thing/\">Google Play Games on PC</a> can pick up where you left off in games played on mobile and can soon play multiple titles at the same time on desktop.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/points\">Play Points</a> enthusiasts who are in the Diamond, Platinum, or Gold levels can win Pixel devices, Razer gaming products, and other gear, along with other game and access perks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those are the upgrades to existing Play features. The big new thing is <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/editorial?id=mc_apps_us_cubes_fcp_acquisition_install_cta_generic&amp;hl=en\">Collections</a>, which, like the \"curated spaces,\" takes content from apps you already have installed and organizes them around broad categories. I spotted \"Watch,\" \"Listen,\" \"Read,\" \"Games,\" \"Social,\" \"Shop,\" and \"Food\" in Google's animated example. You can toggle individual apps feeding into the Collections in the settings.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038915#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038915&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2558c65c9cc6cabce6f28bb18f050f9aea1ff24fcc8319feeec2c25ccfe8190a","category":"Tech"}
