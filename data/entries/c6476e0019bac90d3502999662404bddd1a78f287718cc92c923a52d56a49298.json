As evidence of this, Valve <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3122680206583792325\">posted some quick pictures late Thursday evening</a> of the final packaging that will hopefully be reaching preorder customers early next year.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sd1.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sd1-640x427.jpeg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sd1.jpeg\">Yup, it's a box all right.</a> (credit: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3122680206583792325\">Valve</a>)</p></div>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sd2.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sd2-640x427.jpeg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sd2.jpeg\">A multi-language lining.</a> (credit: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3122680206583792325\">Valve</a>)</p></div>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sd3.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sd3-640x427.jpeg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sd3.jpeg\">Unlike </a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/apple-praised-for-removing-earpods-and-charger-from-iphone-12-box.html\">recent iPhone packaging</a>, the Steam Deck will come with a region-appropriate power supply to enable the unit's USB-C charging.

Among the English suggestions: \"On the toilet, on the subway, on a ferris wheel, on the moon, in a test chamber, on the couch, in a hammock, in a tent.\"</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sd4.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sd4-640x427.jpeg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sd4.jpeg\">The case includes the Steam Deck's minimalist \"circle and a curve\" logo.</a> (credit: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3122680206583792325\">Valve</a>)</p></div>\n<p>Valve also provided a look at the form-fitting carrying case that will accompany the lower-end 64GB and 256GB editions of the system. The new case, which includes an understated Steam Deck logo on the front outside, differs from the Valve-logoed carrying cases the company showed <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/2963920750895461227\">when Valve started shipping dev kits in September</a>. Those who purchase the 512GB system, meanwhile, have been promised an \"exclusive carrying case,\" likely <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steam_Deck_case-1440x810.jpg\">this one</a>, which has a white lining and an embedded Valve logo. The case was first shown when <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/steam-deck-is-valves-switch-like-portable-pc-starting-at-399-this-december/\">the Deck was announced</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817914#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817914&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c6476e0019bac90d3502999662404bddd1a78f287718cc92c923a52d56a49298","category":"Tech"}
