This padding is said to be a breathable material that “allows the dissipation of moisture to the outer shell”.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Resistex padding now forms a brow around the front of the head.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The Utopia Y weighs 258g in a size medium on our Scales of Truth (2g lighter than claimed).</p>\n<p>Kask is also debuting its new Octofit+ adjustment system, which replaces Octofit.</p>\n<p>According to the Italian brand, the new retention system envelops a wider area across the back of the neck. It also relies on a larger rotation dial coated in a special rubber to improve grip and ease of use. The result, it says, is improved comfort and stability.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Has Kask reached Utopia?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Kask’s faux leather chin strap design remains. It’s purported to improve comfort and reduce irritation.</p>\n<p>Kask continues to forgo using <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-mips/\">MIPS technology</a> in its helmets; the Utopia Y passes its own WG11 internal testing protocol, which sees the helmet impacted at five different points at a velocity of 6m/s. This includes impacts to the front, front lateral, side, rear and rear lateral points of the helmet.</p>\n<p>The Utopia Y is available in an array of colours – ‘White Matt’, ‘White Shine’, ‘Black Matt’, ‘Black Shine’, ‘Oxford Blue’, Red and Grey, with a modified application of its branded graphics.</p>\n<p>The helmet will retail for £245 / $300 / €275 / AU$410 and is available in sizes S to L.</p>\n<h2>Kask Utopia Y first impressions</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Utopia Y has a sleek profile.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p><em>Senior technical editor Ashley Quinlan has spent some time with the helmet ahead of its launch. These are his first impressions: </em></p>\n<p>The Utopia Y would appear to be a case ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’.</p>\n<p>The outer shell remains practically identical to the old Utopia. The vents are in the same place and the same size, too.</p>\n<p>Visibly, the only obvious change is to the graphic placement, along with the inclusion of two small reflective tabs under the rear vents.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The ‘Black Shine’ colour scheme is certainly shiny.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Perhaps indicatively, Kask doesn’t claim any improvements in aero or cooling performance, but under the hood there’s more going on that – so far – would seem to improve the overall package.</p>\n<p>The internal padding now forms a brow around the front of the head (much like the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/kask-mojito-3/\">Mojito 3</a>, moving away from the design still used for the Valegro), which is said to improve fit. In reality, this could also improve comfort, as well as avoid excess sweat rolling down the face when the weather heats up.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest improvement will prove to be the inclusion of Octofit+, which is said to offer a wider range of adjustment.</p>\n<p>Certainly, it can pull down further over the back of the head, while the adjustment dial adjusts very competently with positive clicks to bring a secure (and comfortable) cradling fit.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> While the Octofit+ system undeniably improves the fit, the dial feels a little cheap compared to the competition.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The dial looks and feels a little cheap compared to, for example, the comfortable leather chin strap and sleek lines of the overall design – but this is a niggle that probably won’t matter to the vast majority of riders.</p>\n<p>We’ll continue to test the Utopia Y over the coming weeks and deliver a full review soon.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"8377193cd45cd1e38a8ea87abc78116365d2050ebc4198a094fe15e56fc08620","category":"Cycling"}
