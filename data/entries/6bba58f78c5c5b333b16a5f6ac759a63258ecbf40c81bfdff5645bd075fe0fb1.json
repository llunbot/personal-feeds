{"title":"James Thomson on the Origins of the MacOS Dock","link":"https://tla.systems/blog/2025/01/04/i-live-my-life-a-quarter-century-at-a-time/","date":1736549539000,"content":"\n<p>James Thomson:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So, we are coming up on a little anniversary for me this weekend.\nOn the 5th of January 2000, Steve Jobs unveiled the new Aqua user\ninterface of Mac OS X to the world at Macworld Expo.</p>\n\n<p>Towards the end of the presentation, he showed off the Dock. You\nall know the Dock, it’s been at the bottom of your Mac screen for\nwhat feels like forever (if you keep it in the correct location,\nanyway).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would not accept this Dock placement blasphemy from anyone else, but from Thomson, well, OK. (The correct location is on the right. Left, we’ll let you argue for. But definitely not on the bottom.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I didn’t design the dock — that was Bas Ording, a talented young\nUI designer that Steve had personally recruited. But it was my job\nto take his prototypes built in Macromind Director and turn them\ninto working code, as part of the Finder team.</p>\n\n<p>I had already written another dock — <a href=\"https://dragthing.com/\">DragThing</a> — before I\nworked for Apple, and that had helped me get a job there. I moved\nover from Scotland to Ireland in late 1996 with my future wife,\nwith both of us joining the small software team there. It was\nprimarily a manufacturing plant, but there was a little bit of\nsoftware and hardware testing and engineering that went on around\nthe edges.</p>\n\n<p>In the middle of all that, when I was out in Cupertino, I was\nasked if I wanted to work on a secret project with the code name\n“Überbar”. I was shown some prototypes and basically told that six\npeople had seen it, and if it leaked they would know it was me\nthat had talked. I figured if anybody was finally going to kill\noff DragThing, it might as well be me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve heard most of this story over the years — from James — but never all in one narrative like this. There are a lot of 25-year-old stories about how Mac OS X came together that I hope the participants start sharing. Even Apple folks should be free to talk about quarter-century-old work — and both the work and the stories are so good.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/10/thomson-dock\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6bba58f78c5c5b333b16a5f6ac759a63258ecbf40c81bfdff5645bd075fe0fb1","category":"Tech"}
