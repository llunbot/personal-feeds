Upgraded’s basic premise is simple: it’s like Apple’s iPhone upgrade program, but for MacBooks. Through Upgraded, you can get a new MacBook every two years with low monthly payments, AppleCare+ coverage, and effortless upgrades.</p>\n\n<p>You don’t have to pay for your device all at once. With Upgraded’s program, you spread the cost over 36 low monthly payments. You can upgrade to a new device once you’ve made 24 payments, or pay it off over 36 months if you want to keep it instead. You also have the option to leave the upgrade program by returning your device after 24 payments.</p>\n\n<p>It only takes a minute to apply. Your upgrade program is financed by Citizens Pay with APRs starting at 0%, based on creditworthiness. You can check if you’re eligible without impact to your credit score. Once you’ve joined, you can keep track of your upgrade schedule and new releases, chat with support, <a href=\"https://getupgraded.com/home-vp1/?utm_source=daringfireball\">and more on Upgraded’s website</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/18/upgraded\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a42421e45f82ee2426ac8015a56a0d802fc4c8ef889e59f8502b94f5210e1909","category":"Tech"}
