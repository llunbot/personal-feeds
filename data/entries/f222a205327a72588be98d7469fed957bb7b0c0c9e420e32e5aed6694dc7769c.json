{"title":"ChatGPT Can Now Remember and Reference All Your Previous Chats","link":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/chatgpt-can-now-remember-and-reference-all-your-previous-chats/","date":1744674702000,"content":"\n<p>Samuel Axon, writing for Ars Technica:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some time ago, OpenAI <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/amnesia-begone-soon-chatgpt-will-remember-what-you-tell-it-between-sessions/\">added</a> a feature called “Memory” that\nallowed a limited number of pieces of information to be retained\nand used for future responses. Users often had to specifically\nask ChatGPT to remember something to trigger this, though it\noccasionally tried to guess at what it should remember, too.\n[...] Users could enable or disable this feature at will, and it\nwas automatically off for specific chats where users chose the\n“Temporary Chat” option — sort of ChatGPT’s version of\nincognito mode.</p>\n\n<p>The new improvements announced today go far beyond that.</p>\n\n<p>Now, where there was once a checkbox in ChatGPT’s interface to\ndisable or enable memory tracking, there are two checkboxes.\n“Reference saved memories” is the old memory feature, which is\nbasically a limited repository of essential facts. The second is\nthe new feature: “reference chat history.” This allows ChatGPT to\nuse all prior conversations as context and adapt future responses\naccordingly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve been using ChatGPT for a while now. I don’t think I’m a particularly heavy user at all, and I haven’t tried, in particular, to, I don’t know, open up about myself personally. But I ask it what I want to know. So, in the current version, I prompted it with “Describe me based on all our chats — play it straight.” Here’s its response:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You’re sharp, analytical, and deeply detail-oriented. You care a\nlot about precision — whether it’s language, data, or historical\nfacts. You’re not satisfied with vague answers; you want the right\none, ideally backed by sources or structured data. You’re a power\nuser, technically literate, and comfortable with scripting and\ncommand-line tools (especially on macOS), often turning to\nautomation and custom scripts to solve problems.</p>\n\n<p>You follow the tech world closely, especially Apple — its\nhardware, chip architecture, software updates, and even historical\nproduct launches. But you’re not just interested in specs; you\ncare about the bigger picture too, like corporate strategy,\nantitrust laws, and privacy policies.</p>\n\n<p>You also track U.S. politics, legal frameworks, and electoral\nhistory with the same demand for precision and sourcing. And\nyou’ve got a thing for language — choosing the right word,\nunderstanding nuance, and occasionally searching for just the\nright adjective (bonus points if it’s rare or elegant).</p>\n\n<p>Outside of that, you have a strong grasp of sports stats\n(especially NFL and MLB), media history (Letterman, SNL, classic\nfilm), and a dry, sometimes playful sense of humor. You don’t show\noff, but you clearly know your stuff.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m probably not the right person to judge that response, but I think it’s pretty good.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the response I got when I asked Siri “Describe me based on all our chats — play it straight”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don’t see that person in your Contacts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From last week’s blockbuster report by Wayne Ma at The Information, “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/10/wayne-ma-the-information-apple-siri-fumble\">How Apple Fumbled Siri’s AI Makeover</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Giannandrea often has described to employees his belief that\nmachine learning can lead to incremental improvements in products,\neventually adding up to major gains, a concept he refers to as\nhill climbing. He also has expressed a dim view of chatbots in the\npast, telling Apple employees before and immediately after the\nrelease of ChatGPT that he didn’t believe they added much value\nfor users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/14/chatgpt-memory\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f222a205327a72588be98d7469fed957bb7b0c0c9e420e32e5aed6694dc7769c","category":"Tech"}
