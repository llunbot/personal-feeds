It's also tricky to fit it into a photo, at the right angle, while it's in your hands.

The hardware also had a first-gen feel and software jank from both Asus’ own wraparound gaming app and Windows itself. The Ally asked an awkward question: “Do you want to pay nearly 50 percent more than you'd pay for a Steam Deck for a slightly faster but far more awkward handheld?”</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://rog.asus.com/us/gaming-handhelds/rog-ally/rog-ally-x-2024/\">ROG Ally X</a> makes that question more interesting and less obvious to answer. Yes, it’s still a handheld that’s trying to hide Windows annoyances, and it's still missing trackpads, without which some PC games just feel bad. And (review spoiler) it still eats a charge faster than the Steam Deck OLED on less demanding games.</p>\n<p>But the improvements Asus made to this X sequel are notable, and its new performance stats make it more viable for those who want to play more demanding games on a rather crisp screen. At $800, or $100 more than the original ROG Ally with no extras thrown in, you have to really, <em>really</em> want the best possible handheld gaming experience while still tolerating Windows' awkward fit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045977#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045977&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4c4405e54dca8cf610f10642b99be632ab8457196d0665ba31430c85f72fbb1e","category":"Tech"}
