That’s why Atelier Pariah’s Swanee Ravonison feels it’s important to build a message into her bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I chose the name Pariah because I’m a black woman in a white man’s world,’ explains Ravonison. ‘And I’m undeniably never taken seriously.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ravonison is no newcomer to the industry. Based in Nevers, France, she is a graphic designer by trade and has a background in fine art, which comes through in her approach to creating bikes. But she has also been cycling since childhood, both competitively and for pleasure.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/andre-pfeil-kocmo-titan-bikes\">Meet the maker: André Pfeil of Kocmo Titan Bikes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/javier-valiente-amapola-cycles\">Meet the maker: Javier Valiente of Amapola Cycles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/alex-de-kraker-st-joris-cycles\">Meet the maker: Alex de Kraker of St Joris Cycles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>‘Road, fixed-gear, gravel, mountain bike, BMX, long-distance, touring, bike commuting…’ she recounts. ‘I first had a store with a partner that went very badly, then I worked for Decathlon before opening my own bike shop.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-02-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Atelier Pariah\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-02-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-02-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-02-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Swanee Ravonison is very aware that she doesn’t look like a typical framebuilder – and the Black Queen, with a livery based on Japanese knotweed, is not your typical frame.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Atelier Pariah used to be called the Bike Fairy. I did repairs and custom assembly. Then in 2016 I decided, at the same time, to make frames after taking a week-long framebuilding initiation course at OTM Bike in Denmark.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ravonison spent several years building frames and running her shop side by side, but when the pandemic hit she decided to focus on her framebuilding venture full time under the Atelier Pariah name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘That was until 2024 when I was hired at an artistic ironwork workshop,’ she adds. ‘Atelier Pariah became a micro-enterprise and my creations no longer catered to orders but to my own desires.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Atelier Pariah\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ravonison has gained a cult following in the world of handmade bicycle frames thanks to her artistic approach to framebuilding. She has collaborated with Santa Cruz and Douze Cycles, and when she’s not busy in the workshop she writes bike reviews and features for the French cycling press.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Strong roots</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Atelier Pariah’s Black Queen road bike was one of the standout frames among a sea of standout frames at last year’s Bespoked Handmade Bicycle Show in Dresden, Germany. Presented as part of Sram’s inclusivity scholarship, which offers spots at Bespoked to framebuilders from underrepresented communities, it features an eye-catching hematite-on-raw-steel finish worked into a leaf pattern representative of Japanese knotweed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s an invasive plant, from elsewhere, which constantly grows back in spite of the fact that we encourage its destruction,’ explains Ravonison, emphasising the metaphorical message. As for the frame design, ‘It’s an old-school square geometry frame with thin tubes, a long rear triangle for stability and plenty of clearance for wide tyres,’ she says. ‘It also has an uncut seat tube adjusted to my saddle height.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Atelier Pariah\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-04-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The frame is kitted out with a full Sram Red AXS groupset and Zipp 353 NSW wheelset, all supplied by Sram as part of the inclusivity scholarship. It’s all high-end kit, but for Ravonison, who believes bikes should be simple, easy to maintain and relatively inexpensive, it feels a little over the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The bike overall ended up being far too sophisticated for my taste,’ she says. ‘The ultra-modern and expensive equipment was provided, but I wouldn’t generally use such components. So in the end I have a completely anachronistic bike that’s far from my own preference.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘But at a bike show it is much more difficult to attract attention with a modest approach than with big numbers. It’s good for people to linger to better appreciate; contemplate to better understand.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flashy componentry aside, the thing that really sets this bike apart is that rustic raw metal finish, which gives the Columbus Zona tubes an artistically weathered, perfectly imperfect, <em>wabi-sabi</em> quality.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-05-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Atelier Pariah\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-05-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-05-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-05-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-05-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-05-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-05-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/meet-the-maker-atelier-pariah-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The frame was hand-patinated with hematite,’ says Ravonison. ‘The metal is all naturally aged – no paint, no varnish. The patterns were drawn by hand before patina, then cleaned to leave the leaves in negative, sort of like a stencil.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raw finishes like this one are something of a visual signature of Atelier Pariah’s bikes. The brazes are often visible, and Ravonison approaches the process in a manner more commonly associated with artists than bicycle framebuilders. For her it’s about working the material itself and looking at each bicycle frame as an artistic medium rather than simply joining bits of metal together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ravonison’s goal is to allow what is usually hidden by paint to take centre stage. She believes that there is beauty in the imperfections and she likes her creations to tell a story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for how much a bike like this one would cost to buy, Ravonison is reluctant to put a figure on it. That being said, those interested in commissioning a frame from Atelier Pariah can get in touch directly via atelierpariah.com to discuss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>• This article originally appeared in issue 158 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to </a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/andre-pfeil-kocmo-titan-bikes\">Meet the maker: André Pfeil of Kocmo Titan Bikes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/javier-valiente-amapola-cycles\">Meet the maker: Javier Valiente of Amapola Cycles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/alex-de-kraker-st-joris-cycles\">Meet the maker: Alex de Kraker of St Joris Cycles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/atelier-pariah\">Meet the maker: Swanee Ravonison of Atelier Pariah</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"7ad171f82091ef86e4201120f2f323fa4d5f46cfd628bd5a31c8aba7eaff72a8","category":"Cycling"}
