There have been strong and reliable rumors of a foldable iPhone being just two years away dating <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231142/report-apple-is-working-on-a-foldable-iphone-for-2020.html\">as far back as 2018</a>, at least. Back then, reliable reports from the likes of CNBC said Apple was going to have a folding iPhone on the market in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That became 2021, 2022, 2024, 2025… and now it’s scheduled to land in 2026 at the earliest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while the rumors and reports from parts suppliers and analysts are heating up and seem to be more solid than ever, we would advise even more caution and skepticism than usual with Apple rumors.  Having said that, here’s what the current rumors suggest about the release of a folding iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Folding iPhone: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a series of reports, the major design and specs of Apple’s first folding phone are due to be finalized in the middle of 2025, with production targeted for late 2026. That would mean <strong>a launch late in 2026 or early 2027</strong>. So far, this timeline has been suggested by several sources in 2024 and 2025, including The Information, The Wall Street Journal, and analysts<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2629119/report-folding-iphone-will-be-ultra-thin-crease-free-and-cost-over-2000.html\"> Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-23/apple-aapl-explores-turning-watches-into-wearable-ai-devices-with-cameras-m8ll6mvy\">Mark Gurman</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phone is expected to be complex and expensive to manufacture, so production volume will likely be very limited at first. A <strong>second model in late 2027</strong> should see higher production numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Folding iPhone: Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2229833/folding-iphone-ipad-development-release-years-away.html\">The Information reported</a> that Apple had made a couple of prototype “clamshell” flip-phone designs, where the top and bottom of the phone fold to meet. More recent rumors in 2025 from <a href=\"https://weibo.com/6048569942/Pfix4opVg\">Digital Chat Station on Weibo</a> and analyst <a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> suggest a <strong>“book” style fold</strong>, with a vertical fold as the left and right sides fold to meet each other. This is a similar style to the <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2454221/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review.html\">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2411140/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review.html\">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hinge is expected to be one of its most unique features. Some reports have suggested it will be made of a titanium alloy, while Kup reported in March 2025 that Apple is exploring the use of LiquidMetal for “durability, enhancing screen flatness, and minimizing crease marks” in the screen. Apple has received <a href=\"https://www.patentlyapple.com/2024/12/apple-was-granted-a-patent-today-for-an-elaborate-hinge-for-future-foldable-devices-like-an-iphone-ipad-and-more.html\">several patents</a> for hinge designs, and it’s unclear which the company will use in the final design.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-review-22.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review 22\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-review-22.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-review-22.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-review-22.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-review-22.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-review-22.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-review-22.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-review-22.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-review-22.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The folding iPhone could be a similar size to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Luke Baker</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Folding iPhone: Size and dimensions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has reported on the folding iPhone’s <a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f\">set of proposed design details</a>. He says the book-style iPhone will have a <strong>7.8-inch inside display</strong> when unfolded, and a <strong>5.5-inch outer display</strong>. Kuo says Apple won’t be satisfied until the phone’s display is completely crease-free when opened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The folding phone is said to be at most <strong>9.5mm thick when folded and 4.5mm when unfolded</strong>. For comparison, an iPhone 16 Pro Max is 8.5mm thick, and the thinnest iPhone of all time was the iPhone 6 at 6.9mm. The upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17 Air</a> is expected to be around 6mm thick and possibly as thin as 5.5mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Folding iPhone: Specs and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t know what processor the folding iPhone will contain, but if it launches in 2026 as rumored, it will probably feature an <strong>A20 or A20 Pro</strong>—some variant of the processor found in the iPhone 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect most iPhones to use <strong>Apple’s own cellular modem</strong> and <strong>Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chips</strong> by that time as well. They may even be integrated into the main system-on-chip. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iPad_Air_2022_review_Touch_ID_fingerprint_scanner.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPad Air (2022) review: Touch ID fingerprint scanner\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iPad_Air_2022_review_Touch_ID_fingerprint_scanner.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iPad_Air_2022_review_Touch_ID_fingerprint_scanner.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iPad_Air_2022_review_Touch_ID_fingerprint_scanner.jpg?resize=768%2C469&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iPad_Air_2022_review_Touch_ID_fingerprint_scanner.jpg?resize=1200%2C733&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iPad_Air_2022_review_Touch_ID_fingerprint_scanner.jpg?resize=1536%2C938&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"733\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The folding iPhone will reportedly have a Touch ID-enabled power button rather than Face ID.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the very thin nature of the foldable iPhone, and the need for different front-facing cameras when folded up or unfolded, it will reportedly lack Face ID. Instead, <strong>Touch ID</strong> will be incorporated into the side button much as it is on the iPad Air and mini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will reportedly be <strong>two rear cameras</strong> (likely a standard wide and ultrawide) and <strong>two front-facing cameras</strong>, one for when the iPhone is folded closed and one for when it’s open.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Folding iPhone: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect the folding iPhone to be a very high-end, ultra-premium model. The very first release is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2629119/report-folding-iphone-will-be-ultra-thin-crease-free-and-cost-over-2000.html\">said to cost <strong>$2,000 or more</strong></a> and could start at $2,299, twice the highest-end iPhone Pro Max..</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5154b75781573747d4e223357f4751028124896a0c432dc568497a7dd835e3cb","category":"Apple"}
