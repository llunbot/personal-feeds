The new preview is also removing several power-user-oriented settings away from the File Explorer's Folder Options menu, most of which have been around for decades. These are the settings Microsoft has removed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hide Folder Merge conflict</li>\n<li>Always show icons, never thumbnails</li>\n<li>Display file icon on thumbnails</li>\n<li>Display file type information on Folder tips</li>\n<li>Hide protected OS files</li>\n<li>Show drive letters</li>\n<li>Show popup description for Folder and Desktop items</li>\n<li>Show encrypted or compressed NTFS files in color</li>\n<li>Use sharing wizard</li>\n</ul>\n<div><img alt=\"The Folder Options menu, one of several Windows 95-style menus lurking just below Windows 11's shiny surface.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/folder-options.jpeg\" /><p>The Folder Options menu, one of several Windows 95-style menus lurking just below Windows 11's shiny surface.

In a default Windows install, some of these options are on-by-default and others are off-by-default; Microsoft didn't say any of these defaults would be changing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948543#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948543&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9407d484432f7c46c8fc023bf858f03ae8b1cff4e185ee0e13b715f692342a0b","category":"Tech"}
