Adding to that cushion are 2.6-inch 29er Maxxis Ikon tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both versions come standard with a rear rack rated for 55 pounds, plus mudguards, front and rear lights, DB8 brakes, and a direct-mount kickstand. Mondraker says its aluminum frames are designed with “forward geometry” in mind, giving the Chaser X range “more comfort and safety than a conventional urban…bike ever could.” You can make that determination for yourself with this geometry chart.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-101241-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"466\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-101241-800x466.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-101241-800x466.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-101241-297x173.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-101241-120x70.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-101241-768x447.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-101241-1536x894.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-20-101241-2048x1192.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>CHASER X and CHASER RX</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The CHASER X is the entry-level model and gets a RockShox Recon Silver RL 29 fork and a SRAM SX Eagle 12-speed drivetrain.
