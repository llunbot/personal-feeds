Wonder what would go along with that in 2022? Like, something that matches? Or better yet rhymes with ‘odd Viking’…maybe an alliteration? Hmmm</p>\n<p>— Jonathan Vaughters (@Vaughters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Vaughters/status/1434634367779758081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n<p>Now, the news is official.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eiking has signed with the American WorldTour outfit after he enjoyed a particularly strong second half to his 2021 season. The 26-year-old Norwegian landed in the top 10 at the Donostia San Sebastian Klasikoa and finishing second overall at the Arctic Race of Norway before he rode into red on stage 10 of the Vuelta and held the race lead until stage 16, ultimately finishing 11th overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I was watching him throughout the season,” Vaughters said of Eiking. “He was great in San Sebastian. He almost won the Arctic Race of Norway and then went to the Vuelta and had a great run in the leader’s jersey. Almost pulled off a top 10 overall. I watched it all. I was talking to his agent the entire time and an opportunity came up to pull the trigger on it and I did not hesitate.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eiking is hoping to build on his strong showing at the Vuelta as he moves forward in his career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s changed me as a rider,” he said of the Spanish Grand Tour. “It gave me more confidence, seeing that it’s possible to stay with some of the best riders. I want to continue on this good path where I am now.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/odd-christian-eiking-who-wore-red-for-seven-stages-at-the-vuelta-signs-with-ef/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"dbff1e5e493f4dd37ab404eadcbe781c8a6f789add0e04d447c8c51df346bdf5","category":"Cycling"}
