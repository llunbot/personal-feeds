When activated on an iPhone (or iPad, for that matter), it silences all incoming notifications, calls and texts so you don’t get woken up or distracted when you need to be left alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s useful for the person using the mode, but rather less enjoyable if you’re the one who can’t get through. If someone isn’t answering your calls and texts (and you haven’t done or said anything unusually offensive recently), you’re probably wondering if there’s any way to tell if the person has their iPhone set to Do Not Disturb. And if they are, is there any way to bypass Do Not Disturb and contact them anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also be the one using Do Not Disturb and wondering what the other person will see if they try to contact you. If you want to avoid an awkward situation read on to find out the answer to the question: if I put someone on do not disturb will they know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we show you how to use Do Not Disturb, what happens when you do, and how to get around a Do Not Disturb setting to reach out to someone in an emergency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does Do Not Disturb do?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do Not Disturb lets you silence anything on your phone that could cause a distraction. With Do Not Disurb on your phone won’t ring or buzz when you receive phone calls, new text messages, new emails, or invitations. There are some notifications that will get through, such as timers and alarms and government alerts, such as emergency alerts and AMBER alerts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s handy if you’re in the cinema, at a meeting, about to go to sleep, or for any other reason don’t want to be disturbed. It used to be an individual setting, but it’s been lumped together with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/617705/focus-mode.html\">Focus Modes</a> since their introduction in iOS 15. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to turn on Do Not Disturb</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can turn on Do Not Disturb from Control Center:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Control Center (swipe down from the top right of the screen on an iPhone with no Home button, or swipe up from the bottom on a Touch ID phone).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap the crescent moon symbol that says “Focus.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select Do Not Disturb. (There are other options such as Sleep and Driving).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various ways to fine-tune your Do Not Disturb settings in Settings &gt; Focus &gt; Do Not Disturb. You can set a schedule so the mode is activated automatically at bedtime, and add people or apps to the Allow Notifications exceptions so those will go through, no matter what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a “Driving” focus mode that is similar to Do Not Disturb, which by default will automatically enable when you’re driving. In that case, anyone who texts you will receive an automated message informing them of the situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to tell if you have Do Not Disturb on</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the iPhone 8 and older, you’ll see a small moon icon appear in the menu at the top of your screen, next to the battery indicator. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your iPhone has a notch, the moon will appear next to the clock and will be visible at the bottom of the lock screen.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dnd-lock-screen.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"DND Lock Screen\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dnd-lock-screen.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4493w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dnd-lock-screen.jpg?resize=300%2C210&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dnd-lock-screen.jpg?resize=768%2C538&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dnd-lock-screen.jpg?resize=1200%2C840&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dnd-lock-screen.jpg?resize=1536%2C1075&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dnd-lock-screen.jpg?resize=2048%2C1434&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"840\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to make it possible for someone to contact you despite Do Not Disturb</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To add certain people to a set of contacts that can break through a Do Not Disturb setting, follow these steps: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Settings. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Focus. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Do Not Disturb. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on People. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Add. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now select people from your contacts who should always be able to contact you. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dnd-example.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Do Not Disturb settings\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dnd-example.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4493w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dnd-example.jpg?resize=300%2C210&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dnd-example.jpg?resize=768%2C538&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dnd-example.jpg?resize=1200%2C840&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dnd-example.jpg?resize=1536%2C1075&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dnd-example.jpg?resize=2048%2C1434&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"840\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also make sure that people you have added to your Favorites list can call you in an emergency. Just tap on the Allow Calls From section and choose Favourites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make sure that people can get through in an emergency you can also choose the Allow Repeated Calls setting in Settings &gt; Focus &gt; People. That way if they call again within three minutes they will get through to you. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What happens if the person you phone or text is using Do Not Disturb?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We tested this feature by getting a colleague to turn on Do Not Disturb, then calling and texting them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we called, we heard a single ring and were then put through to voicemail. Our colleague’s phone didn’t actually ring, and they didn’t get any kind of audible or lit-screen notification. However, when they turned the screen back on manually they saw a ‘Missed Call’ notification, as well as the missed-call text alert specific to certain carriers.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3649437/how_to_tell_if_using_do_not_disturb_mode_1000b_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"How to tell if someone's iPhone is on Do Not Disturb mode: Notifications\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When we sent an iMessage, the message appeared to send normally.

Are you blocked?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the person you are trying to call has Do Not Disturb on your call will go straight to voice mail. However, if you try to call again soon after you may be able to reach them due to a setting that specifies that it is ok to Allow Repeated Calls. That means that a second call from the same person within three minutes will not be silenced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you still can’t get through after trying a second time, it’s possible the person is using the Silence Unknown Callers feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silence Unknown Callers is a feature introduced in iOS 13 that will send a call straight to voicemail if it determines they’re an “unknown caller,” meaning the number is not in their Contacts, Messages, recent calls, or Mail. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this in mind, consider whether the person you’re calling may not have your contact details. Perhaps you have a new phone and they don’t know your new number? Or maybe they deleted you… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to turn on Silence Unknown Callers, which is a great way of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232957/how-to-block-spam-calls-on-your-iphone.html\">stopping spam calls on an iPhone</a>, but has the side effect of stopping calls from anyone not in your Contacts, go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Phone</em>, scroll down, and ensure that <em>Silence Unknown Callers</em> is enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The symptoms of Do Not Disturb and a full-on block are fairly similar, but the solutions are different. You can find out more in further articles:  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668658/how-to-tell-if-someone-has-blocked-your-number-on-iphone.html\">How to tell if someone has blocked you</a> and  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671150/how-to-call-someone-who-blocked-your-number-on-iphone.html\">How to call someone who has blocked you</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to call someone who has Do Not Disturb on</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s useful to know that Do Not Disturb has some (optional) loopholes deliberately built in, so that people can allow calls through in emergencies. There are essentially three loopholes you may be able to exploit… er, we mean, use responsibly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To explore these settings yourself, open the <em>Settings</em> app, select <em>Focus</em>, then <em>Do Not Disturb</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Repeated calls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, Do Not Disturb is set up to allow calls through if the same number calls again within three minutes—the idea is to ignore most calls but let through urgent ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, your first step if you suspect your friend is using Do Not Disturb should be to call again right away. If they’ve got that default feature activated, you’ll break through the DND barrier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll find this setting by selecting <em>People</em> in the Do Not Disturb Focus mode settings. There’s a toggle for “Allow Repeated Calls.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Call from a different phone</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also tailor your Do Not Disturb mode by telling it to let some people through but not others. In <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Focus</em> &gt; <em>Do Not Disturb</em>, select People and you can add contacts from which you wish to allow calls or texts. (You can also invert this, changing the Focus mode to allow everyone through <em>except</em> those you identify.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your friend is less likely to be using this feature because it’s deactivated by default; if they are, if you’re not in the favored group there’s not all that much you can do about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you’re a close friend of the contact but happen to have been calling from a new or borrowed phone, it might be worth calling again from your usual number if possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Call at a different time</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Do Not Disturb can be (and frequently is) scheduled to activate at certain times of day—most commonly overnight. To set this up for yourself, select <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Focus</em> &gt; <em>Do Not Disturb</em> and then scroll down tot he Set a Schedule section. You can tap <em>Add Schedule</em> to set days and times you want the Focus mode enabled and even use multiple schedules at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your contact is using Do Not Disturb on a schedule you may be able to get through if you call again at a different time. This is particularly likely to be the case if you’re calling at a commonly antisocial time, if you know your friend is doing important work, at an important social event, or otherwise likely to be refusing calls. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Call again in the morning or after the event has ended. Still can’t get through? You may have been blocked.</p>\n\niPad, iPhone, Personal Software</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1862b24b3e676c1150e2a01d6063bc2756f7c64c2be16223aabbc6a8d18b0da9","category":"Apple"}
