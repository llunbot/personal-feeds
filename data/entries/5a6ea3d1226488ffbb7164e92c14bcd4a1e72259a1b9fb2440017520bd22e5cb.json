In particular, an artist named Pier-Olivier Desbiens <a href=\"https://x.com/Pioldes/status/1709323993847631978?s=20\">posted</a> a series of virtual stickers that went viral on X on Tuesday, starting a thread of similarly offbeat AI image generations shared by others.</p>\n\n<p>\"F<span>ound out that facebook messenger has ai generated stickers now and I don't think anyone involved has thought anything through</span>,\" Desbiens wrote in his post. \"W<span>e really do live in the stupidest future imaginable,\" he <a href=\"https://x.com/Pioldes/status/1709324318897799180?s=20\">added</a> in a reply.</span></p>\n<p>Available to some users on a limited basis, the new AI stickers feature allows people to create AI-generated simulated sticker images from text-based descriptions in both Facebook Messenger and Instagram Messenger. The stickers are then shared in chats, similar to emojis. Meta uses its new <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/emu-enhancing-image-generation-models-using-photogenic-needles-in-a-haystack/\">Emu</a> image synthesis model to create them and has implemented filters to catch many potentially offensive generations. But plenty of novel combinations are slipping through the cracks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973122#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973122&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5a6ea3d1226488ffbb7164e92c14bcd4a1e72259a1b9fb2440017520bd22e5cb","category":"Tech"}
