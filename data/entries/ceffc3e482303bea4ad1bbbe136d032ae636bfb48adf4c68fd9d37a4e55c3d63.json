The price was revealed briefly on LG's website.</p>\n<p>Apart from the rolling feature, the TV offers little over other OLED TVs. The Signature OLED R doesn't even feature the best picture quality that LG's OLED lineup has to offer. The high-end, non-rollable G1 sets (which cost a little under $3,000) can achieve greater peak brightness, which is key to making a big impression with HDR content. The rollable version instead offers similar performance to 2020's high-end OLED sets. (The peak brightness upgrade was exclusive to the G series in the 2021 lineup.)</p>\n<p>The LG C1 is arguably the most comparable set from the 2021 lineup in terms of picture quality, and the 65-inch version of that TV retails for just over $2,000. That means you'll be paying almost 50 times more for the ability to roll your TV's screen down like a car window.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780581#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780581&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ceffc3e482303bea4ad1bbbe136d032ae636bfb48adf4c68fd9d37a4e55c3d63","category":"Tech"}
