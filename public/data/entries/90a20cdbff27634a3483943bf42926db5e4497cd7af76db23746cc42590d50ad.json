{"title":"‘Shift Happens: A Book About Keyboards’","link":"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mwichary/shift-happens","date":1675794006000,"content":"\n<p>Marcin Wichary:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Keyboards fascinated me for years. But it occurred to me that a\ngood, comprehensive, and human story of keyboards — starting with\ntypewriters and ending with modern computers and phones — has\nnever been written. How did we get from then to now? What were the\nsteps along the way? And how on earth does QWERTY still look the\nsame now as it did 150 years ago?</p>\n\n<p>I wanted a book like this for years. So I wrote it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If this rings a bell, that’s because Glenn Fleishman — who is the editor and print production manager for the book — <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2022/12/31/ep-366\">mentioned this project on The Talk Show a few weeks ago</a>. I’ve been looking forward to supporting it on Kickstarter ever since.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/02/07/shift-happens\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"90a20cdbff27634a3483943bf42926db5e4497cd7af76db23746cc42590d50ad","category":"Tech"}
