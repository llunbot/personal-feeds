These machines included some gaming laptop features like configurable RGB keyboards and high refresh rate screens, but because they still used integrated GPUs, they were meant mostly for use with streaming services like <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/memberships/\">Nvidia's GeForce Now</a> and <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play\">Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>.</p>\n<p>But there were also apparently plans for some gaming Chromebooks with the power to play more games locally. Earlier this year, 9to5Google <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/05/22/nvidia-rtx-gpu-upcoming-chromebooks/\">spotted</a> developer comments earlier this year pointing to a Chromebook board (codenamed Hades) that would have included a dedicated GeForce RTX 4050 GPU like the one found in some Windows gaming notebooks. This board would have served as a foundation that multiple PC makers could have used to build Chromebooks.</p>\n\n<p>But these models apparently won't be seeing the light of day anytime soon. Developer comments spotted by <a href=\"https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chromebooks-with-nvidia-gpus-get-the-chopping-block-too/?expand_article=1\">About Chromebooks</a> this week indicate that the Hades board (plus a couple of other Nvidia-equipped boards, Agah and Herobrine) has been canceled, which means that any laptops based on that board won't be happening.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961791#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961791&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"86fb5035da811cc931518d5f8761bc49ce4f543246fb66d36577658ffa7a9429","category":"Tech"}
