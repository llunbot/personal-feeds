Nudging the mile count into three figures satisfies an innate desire for neatness.</p>\n<p>But not even the fittest rider can set out on a 100-mile route without forethought. Conquering a century requires preparation, planning and a big effort on the day.</p>\n<p>Our guide to riding 100 miles or further will help you accomplish your goal and look back fondly on the experience in years to come.</p>\n<p>Who knows, maybe you’ll catch the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/ultra-distance-cycling/\">ultra-endurance cycling </a>bug in the process.</p>\n<h2>Plan the right route</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wahoo Elemnt Roam V2 mapping screen\" title=\"Wahoo Elemnt Roam V2 mapping screen\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Although you can plan a route on a paper map, it’s best to follow it on a bike computer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Riding 100 miles is hard enough without accumulating thousands of metres or feet of elevation gain.</p>\n<p>A flatter route is advisable for your first century.
