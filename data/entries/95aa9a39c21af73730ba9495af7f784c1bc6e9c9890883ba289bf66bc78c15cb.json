There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's January 25, and today's image is nothing short of amazing and inspirational.</p>\n<p>Courtesy of the James Webb Space Telescope, this image features a nebula, N79, in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby small galaxy. (Can we call galaxies small?) This is a massive, super-active star-forming region that spans more than 1,600 light-years. So what's with that bright spot in the middle of the image? It's a bright young star.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998840#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998840&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"95aa9a39c21af73730ba9495af7f784c1bc6e9c9890883ba289bf66bc78c15cb","category":"Tech"}
