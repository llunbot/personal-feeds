Apple has also removed remaining references to Sprint from its online store.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/TMobile-Sprint-16x9.jpeg\" alt width=\"1066\" height=\"600\" />\r<br />\nWhen checking out with a new purchase, Sprint is no longer an option for connectivity, a change that Apple appears to have implemented today. Prior to now, Sprint customers were still technically able to activate Sprint devices through the T-Mobile network, and Apple listed Sprint carrier deals.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven that T-Mobile completed its Sprint merger <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/01/t-mobile-sprint-merger-completed/\">back in 2020</a>, it is likely that this change will not affect many people. Many Sprint customers have already been transitioned to T-Mobile accounts and are no longer technically Sprint customers, but there may still be some individuals out there who have not yet completed the transfer over to T-Mobile.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSprint customers have technically been using the T-Mobile network since shortly after the acquisition, as T-Mobile began incorporating Sprint spectrum into its network <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/21/tmobile-sprint-network-merging/\">in April 2020</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFormer Sprint customers who are experiencing issues related to their service should contact T-Mobile for help as they will need to move their Sprint accounts to T-Mobile to activate their devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, Dave!)</em><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sprint/\">Sprint</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/\">T-Mobile</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/23/apple-stops-sprint-activations/\">Apple Stops Allowing Sprint iPhone Activations, Removes Sprint References From Online Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-allowing-sprint-iphone-activations-removes-sprint-references-from-online-store.2384584/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"03d0d3dd0afdda1535bfdb1bc052e3c546dce1cf163413f17bb4f61cff1b1081","category":"Apple"}
