This is Canyon’s first bike to feature the GPS module required for tracking.</p>\n<p>The 173.8g tracking module works on a 4G LTE connection similar to a smartphone and sends the bike’s GPS data to Canyon’s servers, which then display the bike’s location on the app.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon App with GPS tracking\" title=\"Canyon App with GPS tracking\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Canyon says notifications are sent when a bike leaves a geofence, so your phone won’t be pinging if you’re moving the bike around your home.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>The app will send a notification to your phone if the bike has been moved and will give guidance on what steps are required should it be stolen.</p>\n<p>Canyon says it will offer all GPS-fitted bikes with 12 months of free tracking, but after this customers will need to pay an undisclosed subscription fee to continue accessing the feature.</p>\n<p>Customers can decide to turn the tracking feature off or have the module removed from the bike altogether.</p>\n<p>The module takes power from the bike’s drive unit battery and features a ‘buffer’ battery, which enables you to keep tracking the bike’s location even when the main battery has been removed.</p>\n<p>It’s not clear whether the GPS module will be fitted to non-assisted bikes in the future, but it’s likely we’ll see GPS tracking throughout Canyon’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bikes</a> range.</p>\n<p>While Canyon claims worldwide tracking, a bike can only send its location if it has a 4G LTE connection.</p>\n<p>Canyon says GPS-equipped bikes will receive discounted bicycle insurance quotes, which will be available for purchase through the new app at the end of the month.</p>\n<h2>From box to built</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon App with GPS tracking\" title=\"Canyon App with GPS tracking\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Step-by-step illustrations and video guides should help customers get rolling in no time.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>Being a direct-to-customer brand, Canyon sends its bikes out to customers partially built and in a box.</p>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-assemble-a-bike/\">help you assemble your bike</a>, the new app features guided videos and step-by-step instructions for taking it out of the box and setting it up for riding.</p>\n<p>The app also provides users with maintenance guides on how to look after their bikes and enables users to log <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-get-your-bike-saddle-height-right/\">saddle height</a> and other measurements that may be useful when dismantling a bike for travel.</p>\n<h2>Components catalogue</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon App with GPS tracking\" title=\"Canyon App with GPS tracking\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The app can keep track of multiple Canyon bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>Within the ‘digital garage’ function of the app, users will be able to search for their bike’s original spec list.</p>\n<p>Canyon has said an option of purchasing replacements through its store will be added to the app’s functionality in the future, giving users easy access to a compatible parts list.</p>\n<p>Relevant content, such as user manuals and maintenance guides, will also be available through this section of the app, enabling customers to access them when they’re away from home.</p>","author":"Nick Clark","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"fd10a8d330e56d0b41f4ba6b8fcff62dfcc6be7c103b1c71d1f9c094ffa09bda","category":"Cycling"}
