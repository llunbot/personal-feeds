Find a climb – any climb – and pedal up it enough times to accumulate 8,848m of ascent, and you’ve done it.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>But let’s face it – the prospect of repeating the same local hill hundreds of times to rack up the required amount of climbing hardly sets the pulse racing. A far more interesting challenge is the Roaming Everest, where you reach the magical 8,848m without riding the same climb twice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For that you need proper mountains, and lots of them. Which is why the Big Ride in the Winter 2024 issue of <em>Cyclist</em> magazine has us in the French Pyrenees, aiming to tick off some of the most famous climbs in cycling over the course of a gruelling 299km ride that starts and ends in darkness. But then no one ever said scaling Everest was easy…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if that’s not enough climbing for you, why not join us on our two-day off-road adventure in the Austrian Alps, where the hills are alive with the crunch of gravel as we explore the picture postcard majesty of the Salzburgerland region.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-3-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Switching gears, in the first of a new series about the world’s most desirable bikes, we pay tribute to the Moots Vamoots CRD, a lightweight titanium machine that shows carbon isn’t the only way to go when designing a high-performance race bike.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-4-970x650.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-4-970x650.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-4-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-4-768x515.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-4-750x503.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-4-1140x764.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/new-issue-159-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The titanium theme continues elsewhere in the Winter issue too with our feature on Ribble’s new Allroad and our review of the stylish Singular Kite Titanium in the Tested section, while the Leadout section at the front of the magazine is headed by the new Scott Addict RC, which weighs in at a remarkable 5.9kg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s plenty more to enjoy in the latest issue too, so pick up your copy on newsstands or <a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-159\" target=\"_blank\">a</a><a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-158\" target=\"_blank\">t the Cyclist Shop</a> or <a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscribe\" target=\"_blank\">get a Cyclist magazine subscription</a> to have every issue delivered free, straight to your door.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscribe\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-3-970x327.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-3-970x327.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-3-300x101.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-3-768x259.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-3-1536x517.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-3-2048x689.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-3-750x252.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-3-1140x384.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There are three levels of <em>Cyclist </em>subscriptions available.
