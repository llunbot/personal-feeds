The pedals jump forward, bucking the tired body out of the saddle. He wobbles, then topples and, in slow-motion, makes his way to the ground for an involuntary inspection of Tuscany’s white gravel roads.</p>\n<p>I’m on the final gravel climb of the Gran Fondo Strade Bianche, the amateur sportive that takes place on the same roads as the Italian one-day Classic, but 24 hours after the pros.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2023-strade-bianche-tech-gallery/\">Strade Bianche</a>, contested over the ‘white roads’ that give the race its name, has already earned near-Monument status, despite being won for the first time by Alexandr Kolobnev in 2007. Now it serves as the aperitif to the Classics season that follows and, this spring, 7,000 riders – me included – flocked to the region to ride the corresponding sportive.</p>\n<p>The forlorn faller dusts himself down and remounts as I grind past, searching once again for another gear at the top of the cassette. There is no extra gear – there never is, when you really need one. But while the climbs are steep around here, they’re mercifully short, too, and I crest the summit, ready to go again one last time as the hilltop finish in Siena looms into view.</p>\n<h2>Ancient roads on an aero bike</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"George's Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod for the 2023 Gran Fondo Strade Bianche\" title=\"George's Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod for the 2023 Gran Fondo Strade Bianche\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> George’s Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod for the Gran Fondo Strade Bianche.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Daniel Loots / Team EF Coaching</i></span></div>\n<p>I’d arrived in Siena four days earlier to join the training camp guests of Team EF Coaching.

Earlier, we’d embarked on our own race in the EF Education–EasyPost van, jumping between three gravel sectors – with a lunch stop for a generous plate of <em>pici cacio e pepe</em>, thick hand-rolled spaghetti in a cheese and pepper sauce – to watch the race whizz by.</p>\n<p>Watching a professional cycling race is typically an experience of contrasts: the slow build of finding a vantage point in a web of closed roads, following the race on the radio or through a patchy live stream on a smartphone, and the growing anticipation that reaches a visceral climax as the television helicopters thud into view.

Radi is characterised by a series of punchy rollers that are typical of the area, while La Piana is one of Strade Bianche’s classic stretches, having featured in every edition of the race.</p>\n<p>By now, we’re deep into the Tuscan countryside on tracks that see little traffic through the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>Mostly downhill, La Piana should be an opportunity to tick off another 6.4km sector with relative ease, but it’s fast and, more to the point, there’s a deep layer of fresh gravel that means grip is a state of mind, rather than a reality.</p>\n<p>The road snakes from left to right, with a 180-degree hairpin to contend with, too, and, if you want to carry any speed here, you need to be comfortable with the tyres squirming beneath you. Tuscany? It’s more like Tokyo Drift, and I’m glad I’ve got some extra control – or, rather, more margin for error – through the 30c rubber on my bike, rather than the 23c tyres of days gone by.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Peloton riding Strade Bianche 2023\" title=\"Peloton riding Strade Bianche 2023\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 2023 race and gran fondo were blessed with early-spring sunshine.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tim de Waele / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>The Serravalle segment arrives and begins with a climb that rises along a tree-lined ridge.

It is also one of the most beautiful stretches of road I’ve ever ridden, paved or otherwise.</p>\n<p>We’re in the heart of the Crete Senesi now and the landscape unfolds like a crumpled bedsheet, the rolling hills disappearing into the distance under the haze of the early-spring sunshine, before rising up to meet the snow-capped Apennine Mountains in the north.</p>\n<p>A series of tight, steep switchbacks leave me breathless, not only due to the gradient but also because of the remarkable view that stretches as far as the eye can see. Siena sits proudly – ominously – on its hilltop in the distance; behind me, the white road I’ve just climbed hugs the ridge, cutting a path through the spring growth.</p>\n<p>San Martino in Grania brings to a close three successive sectors that have served up more than 25km of gravel.

The first, Monteaperti, is short enough to punch through with gritted teeth, but the second, Colle-Pinzuto, gains more than 100m in elevation and many riders are now walking – or, in my case, riding at walking pace.</p>\n<p>The gravel finale comes on Le Tolfe, a rollercoaster ride that starts with a plunging descent, before the road kicks cruelly up. I’m desperately searching for that extra gear, with each push of the pedals now a sinew-straining leg press. With a fine layer of gravel beneath the tyres, there’s no option but to stay seated – rise out of the saddle and you’ll instantly lose traction, as one fallen rider finds out.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"George Scott of BikeRadar riding Gran Fondo Strade Bianche 2023\" title=\"George Scott of BikeRadar riding Gran Fondo Strade Bianche 2023\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some riders are reduced to walking as the ascent takes its toll.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Gran Fondo Strade Bianche</i></span></div>\n<p>A church stands at the top of the climb and the ascension to its summit, this late in the ride, requires an otherworldly effort.

Gone are the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cannondale-supersix-evo-dura-ace-review/\">classic round tubes of old</a> – a move many traditionalists will still mourn – and in are the aero-profiled tubes and hidden hydraulic hoses of the latest edition. This 2023 frame is lighter, too, at a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cannondale-supersix-evo-hi-mod-2-review/\">claimed 810g for a 56cm frame</a>, painted and with hardware.</p>\n<p>The result of this blend of low weight and aerodynamic prowess is a bike that feels supremely efficient just about everywhere, not least on a rolling course such as the Strade Bianche. That’s an impressive balancing act.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"George's Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod for the 2023 Gran Fondo Strade Bianche\" title=\"George's Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod for the 2023 Gran Fondo Strade Bianche\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Aero wheels add to a fast package.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Daniel Loots / Team EF Coaching</i></span></div>\n<p>There are no long climbs here, but the ascent accumulates via a relentless series of steep ramps. With a rigid, lightweight chassis at its heart, and poised handling for the technical descents on the other side, the SuperSix did a fine job of seeing off everything thrown at it with no fuss whatsoever.</p>\n<p>This is a bike that ticks off the kilometres with relative ease, whether punching uphill, carving downhill or fighting a headwind on the flats.</p>\n<h4>Gravel-friendly clearance</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"George's Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod for the 2023 Gran Fondo Strade Bianche\" title=\"George's Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod for the 2023 Gran Fondo Strade Bianche\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I swapped the supplied 28c tyres for 30c rubber on the eve of the event – and was glad for it.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Daniel Loots / Team EF Coaching</i></span></div>\n<p>The Gran Fondo Strade Bianche serves up a wide variety of ‘gravel’ over the course of its nine <em>sterrato </em>sectors. Compact dirt roads nearly as smooth as tarmac; deeply-rutted roads that have fallen victim to spring storms; filling-rattling washboard; tyre-deep gravel ready to catch out a careless rider; and everything in between.</p>\n<p>Let’s be clear, you could ride the roads around here on the rim-braked, narrow-tyred bikes of the inaugural edition nearly two decades ago – I’m assuming a dry day here – but the gravel-friendly clearance of today’s machines makes the Strade Bianche a more comfortable, more confidence-inspiring and, I’d wager, faster experience.</p>\n<p>I asked for 30c tyres to be fitted in place of the supplied 28c rubber on the eve of the event, and was glad I did. There is nothing to lose by going wider here.</p>\n<p>Oh, and top marks to the Vittoria Corsa Control tyres, set up with inner tubes, for going the distance without any punctures. They’re not the quickest tyres out there, but some additional protection is a smart move here.</p>\n<h4>Seamless SRAM shifting</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"George's Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod for the 2023 Gran Fondo Strade Bianche\" title=\"George's Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod for the 2023 Gran Fondo Strade Bianche\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Seamless shifting from the wireless SRAM Red AXS groupset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Daniel Loots / Team EF Coaching</i></span></div>\n<p>Okay, I’ll keep this short – SRAM’s Red AXS didn’t miss a beat throughout, as much as I tried to churn through the gears with mistimed shifts on the Strade Bianche’s steeper pitches.</p>\n<p>But there’s one key change I’d make if heading back.</p>\n<h3>…and three things I’d change</h3>\n<h4>More generous gearing</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"George's Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod for the 2023 Gran Fondo Strade Bianche\" title=\"George's Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod for the 2023 Gran Fondo Strade Bianche\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Thinking about riding the Gran Fondo Strade Bianche?
