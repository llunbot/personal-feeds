The image suggests that at some point, Apple considered using its \"Pro\" nomenclature for the Apple Watch, possibly for the higher-end stainless steel models, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RendersbyIan/status/1452698383563513857?s=20\">indicated on Twitter</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Upon looking into some of the demo content files on a 2015 Apple Watch Demo (A1623), I discovered an image of logo for an unknown model of Apple Watch. Not sure if “Apple Watch Pro” is an unreleased model, or is just some place holder text. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/appleinternal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#appleinternal</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kbpzBGrokX\">pic.twitter.com/kbpzBGrokX</a></p>— Apple Demo (@AppleDemoYT) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppleDemoYT/status/1452680244238995461?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 25, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nApple uses its \"Pro\" branding for its high-end products, specifically devices that offer more features than the standard model of that product.
