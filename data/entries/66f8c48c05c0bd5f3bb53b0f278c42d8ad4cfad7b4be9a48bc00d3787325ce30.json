[credit:\n                              <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RLgYMwUnuA\">India Today/YouTube</a>\n                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>In 2010, Samsung demoed a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeNJrim3SU4\"> transparent laptop prototype</a>. The OLED laptop looked uniquely futuristic, and there were even <a href=\"https://www.oled-info.com/samsung-might-actually-release-transparent-amoled-laptop-product-within-12-months\">reports</a> that Samsung would release the design for real. But it never did. And 14 years later, even with a different type of display technology improving the experience, it seems like there still isn’t a strong argument for transparent-screen consumer laptops—even with AI shoehorned into the design.</p>\n<h2>Just a prototype for now</h2>\n<p>Before we get into the Lenovo ThinkBook Transparent Display Laptop Concept, keep in mind that it is just a concept. Lenovo has no official plans to release this computer and describes it as a way to explore how transparent displays and AI can be combined.</p>\n<p>That said, Lenovo's executive director of ThinkPad portfolio and product, Tom Butler, told <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24082244/lenovo-concept-transparent-laptop-mwc-2024-drawing-tablet\">The Verge</a> he has \"very high confidence\" that such technologies will be available in a consumer product within the next five years. If that's true, Lenovo will need to figure out what people might want in capabilities.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006439#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006439&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"66f8c48c05c0bd5f3bb53b0f278c42d8ad4cfad7b4be9a48bc00d3787325ce30","category":"Tech"}
