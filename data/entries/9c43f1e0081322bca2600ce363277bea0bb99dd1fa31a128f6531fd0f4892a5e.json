Users can choose a background image or generate one using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/\">Image Playground</a> and customize the look of the invite with different fonts. Apple automatically adds in data from the Maps and Weather apps so that invitees have all of the information they need for an event. People who receive invites can RSVP and the sender can track who has responded. There are options to create a dedicated shared <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> album and a collaborative <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> playlist for the event. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nInvites is <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/icloud/\">an iCloud+ service</a>, which means that it is available to ‌iCloud‌+ subscribers only. ‌iCloud‌+ is priced starting at $0.99 per month, and it provides users with additional ‌iCloud‌ storage over the free 5GB that comes with any device. While anyone is able to respond to an Invite that's sent out, creating invites is limited to ‌iCloud‌+ subscribers. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe discuss Apple's ‌iCloud‌ website and accessing the company's services from non-Apple devices, since Invites is also available via icloud.com. In addition, we reflect on the other apps that Apple has introduced in recent years, including Clips, News, Journal, and Sports. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> also has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow\">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1\"><div>Subscribe to <em>The MacRumors Show</em> YouTube channel!</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can also listen to ‌The MacRumors Show‌ on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1602394741\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/41XOHIA6w8IxAKJZvrnx90\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1602394741\">Overcast</a>, or your preferred podcasts app. You can also <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channels/5096144.rss\">copy our RSS feed</a> directly into your podcast player.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nIf you haven't already listened to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/31/the-macrumors-show-latest-iphone-se-4-rumors/\">previous episode of The MacRumors Show</a>, catch up for our discussion about all of the latest rumors about the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a> 4 as it nears launch. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nSubscribe to ‌The MacRumors Show‌ for new episodes every week, where we discuss some of the topical news breaking here on <em>MacRumors</em>, often joined by interesting guests such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/15/the-macrumors-show-apple-pro-apps-updates/\">Kevin Nether</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/the-macrumors-show-jon-prosser-talks-m4-macs/\">Jon Prosser</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/the-macrumors-show-luke-miani-talks-apple-watch-x/\">Luke Miani</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/12/the-macrumors-show-matthew-cassinelli/\">Matthew Cassinelli</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/the-macrumors-show-brian-tong-vision-pro/\">Brian Tong</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/the-macrumors-show-one-week-with-vision-pro/\">Quinn Nelson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/the-macrumors-show-apple-gaming-ft-toucharcade/\">Jared Nelson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/the-macrumors-show-apple-gaming-ft-toucharcade/\">Eli Hodapp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/the-macrumors-show-former-apple-executive-mike-bell/\">Mike Bell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/06/the-macrumors-show-sara-dietschy-apple-accessories/\">Sara Dietschy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/the-macrumors-show-ijustine-talks-iphone-15/\">iJustine</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/25/the-macrumors-show-iphone-15-jon-rettinger/\">Jon Rettinger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/10/the-macrumors-show-andru-edwards-iphone-ultra/\">Andru Edwards</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/26/the-macrumors-show-arnold-kim/\">Arnold Kim</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/the-macrumors-show-ben-sullins-apple-car/\">Ben Sullins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/07/the-macrumors-show-marcus-kane-headset-design/\">Marcus Kane</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/24/the-macrumors-show-christopher-lawley-talks-ipados/\">Christopher Lawley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/the-macrumors-show-frank-mcshan-yellow-iphone-14/\">Frank McShan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/24/the-macrumors-show-david-lewis-talks-apple-audio/\">David Lewis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/27/the-macrumors-show-tyler-stalman-new-macs/\">Tyler Stalman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/02/the-macrumors-show-apple-event-expectations/\">Sam Kohl</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/09/the-macrumors-show-john-gruber-talks-macos-ventura/\">John Gruber</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/28/the-macrumors-show-ipados-16-ft-federico-viticci/\">Federico Viticci</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/26/the-macrumors-show-thomas-frank-talks-productivity/\">Thomas Frank</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/21/the-macrumors-show-jonathan-morrison/\">Jonathan Morrison</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/the-macrumors-show-ross-young/\">Ross Young</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/21/the-macrumors-show-ian-zelbo/\">Ian Zelbo</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/25/the-macrumors-show-rene-ritchie-talks-mac-studio/\">Rene Ritchie</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌The MacRumors Show‌ is on X <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorsshow\">@MacRumorsShow</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorsshow\"></a>, so be sure to give us a follow to keep up with the podcast.
