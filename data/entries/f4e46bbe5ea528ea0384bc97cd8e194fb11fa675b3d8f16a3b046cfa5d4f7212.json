{"title":"Every New Feature and Change in iOS 18.2 Beta 1","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/23/ios-18-2-new-features-changes/","date":1729736106000,"content":"\n<p>Chance Miller at 9to5Mac has done the yeoman’s work of providing a full illustrated change log for iOS 18.2 beta 1. Here’s one I wasn’t expecting, but which now that I think about it, isn’t surprising:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>iOS 18.2 lets users set default apps for Messaging and Calling\nworldwide. This is managed through a new “Defaults” menu in the\nSettings app, where you can set defaults for these apps in the US:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Email</li>\n<li>Messaging</li>\n<li>Calling</li>\n<li>Call Filtering</li>\n<li>Browser App</li>\n<li>Passwords &amp; Codes</li>\n<li>Keyboards</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clearly this wouldn’t be in iOS 18.2 anywhere in the world if the European Commission weren’t demanding it for DMA compliance, but given that Apple had to do it for the EU, why not make it worldwide? This isn’t a “<em>We think this is a bad idea</em>” thing from Apple’s perspective, like, say, alternative app stores. It’s a “<em>We don’t think this is all that important an idea</em>” thing.</p>\n\n<p>DMA compliance features that Apple wouldn’t have otherwise prioritized, but isn’t outright opposed to, are likely to be made available worldwide. Features Apple is opposed to will remain exclusive to the EU. For example, in iOS 18.2 beta 1 in the EU, users can now “delete” apps like Photos and Camera. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_ios_continental_drift_widens\">That’s a spectacularly dumb idea</a>, so it’s only in the EU.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/23/chance-miller-ios-18-2-changes\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f4e46bbe5ea528ea0384bc97cd8e194fb11fa675b3d8f16a3b046cfa5d4f7212","category":"Tech"}
