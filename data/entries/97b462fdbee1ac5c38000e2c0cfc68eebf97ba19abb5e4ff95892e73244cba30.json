For example, Gurman said that you will be able to turn separate basketball and trash can emoji into a single Genmoji that shows a basketball going into a trash can.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe also expects iOS 26 to include an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/shortcuts-app-apple-intelligence-integration/\">upgraded Shortcuts app powered by Apple Intelligence</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/ios-19-ai-battery-management/\">new AI-powered battery mode</a>, as he previously reported.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, he said there will be system-wide Translate app capabilities on iOS 26. <em>9to5Mac</em> previously reported that the Messages app would be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/ios-26-messages-app-rumors/\">gaining live translation capabilities</a>, but Gurman said it will extend to the Phone app and other areas of the operating system. A live translation feature is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/airpods-live-translation-ios-19/\">also expected for AirPods</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18-Siri-Personal-Context.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWaiting on Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">delayed personalized Siri features</a> to launch? Don't get your hopes up next week, as Gurman said that those features remain \"far off.\" He does not expect any significant new Siri features to be announced at WWDC 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhat happened to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/apple-announced-swift-assist-wwdc24-so-where-is-it/\">Swift Assist</a>, the coding assistance tool that Apple announced at WWDC 2024? Gurman said it faced issues, so Apple instead plans to let developers use Xcode <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/02/apple-anthropic-ai-coding-platform/\">with third-party large language models</a> (LLMs).<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2025</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/genmoji-upgrade-for-ios-26/\">Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2025: Genmoji Upgrade Incoming Instead of Personalized Siri</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-at-wwdc-2025-genmoji-upgrade-incoming-instead-of-personalized-siri.2458303/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"97b462fdbee1ac5c38000e2c0cfc68eebf97ba19abb5e4ff95892e73244cba30","category":"Apple"}
