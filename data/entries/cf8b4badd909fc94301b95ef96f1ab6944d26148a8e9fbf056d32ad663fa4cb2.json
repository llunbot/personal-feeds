Instead of a conventional fabric casing wrapped around a mold and then overwrapped with one natural rubber tread at a time, ReTyre continuously molds a giant spool of flat tire. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The casing feeds through a mold, where a thermoplastic mixture with a consistency and durometer somewhere between rubber and TPU is injection molded directly onto the casing. Then the casing rolls a bit further, and the next set of tread is co-molded on. The result is up to 1-1.5m of tread molded at a time, with relatively smooth seams or transitions from one to the next, right out of the mold.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ReTyre-carbon-neutral-bike-tires_overlap-seam-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ReTyre-carbon-neutral-bike-tires_overlap-seam-detail.jpg\" alt=\"ReTyre carbon neutral bicycle tires, overlap seam\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ReTyre-carbon-neutral-bike-tires_overlap-seam-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ReTyre-carbon-neutral-bike-tires_overlap-seam-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ReTyre-carbon-neutral-bike-tires_overlap-seam-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ReTyre-carbon-neutral-bike-tires_overlap-seam-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ReTyre-carbon-neutral-bike-tires_overlap-seam-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ReTyre-carbon-neutral-bike-tires_overlap-seam-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ReTyre-carbon-neutral-bike-tires_overlap-seam-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tire is then rolled onto a giant spool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only later is it cut to length for the desired tire diameter, and the casing and tread are bonded into a loop to form a single tire. This method is said to further reduce emissions from the shipping and distribution process. So while the spool of tire is manufactured in Norway, ReTyre can finish tire manufacturing with more simple tooling in the local market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Unique recycled and reclaimed ingredients</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-hero.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-hero.jpeg\" alt=\"reTyre World's First Carbon-Neutral Tire hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-hero.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-hero-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-hero-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-hero-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-hero-1200x675.jpeg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/ReTyre)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ReTyre’s Carbon-neutral tire incorporates several unique materials in its construction, each chosen for its ability to minimize environmental impact:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ReTyre tread includes algae harvested from out-of-control blooms that were damaging the local ecosystem. By removing the problematic algae, it halts the <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/eutrophication.html#:~:text=the%20nation's%20estuaries.-,Harmful%20algal%20blooms%2C%20dead%20zones%2C%20and%20fish%20kills%20are%20the,to%20estuaries%20and%20coastal%20waters.\" target=\"_blank\">eutrophication process</a> that chokes out native fish, disrupts natural ecosystems, and emits methane into the atmosphere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That algae is mixed with post-consumer recycled plastics to create the tread. Interestingly, it seems the algae binder + plastics recipe is more flexible on what materials can be added.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Recycled casing &amp; protection, too</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-rubber-free-balance-bike.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-rubber-free-balance-bike.jpeg\" alt=\"reTyre World's First Carbon-Neutral Tire rubber free balance bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-rubber-free-balance-bike.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-rubber-free-balance-bike-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-rubber-free-balance-bike-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-rubber-free-balance-bike-768x576.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Rubberless Balance Bike tires (Photo/ReTyre)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Utilized from used body armor in a closed-loop recycling process, ReTyre incorporates renewable carbon in recycled para-aramid fibers back into the tire beads and its puncture protection layers. And then the fibers of the casing itself are said to be woven from used fishing nets at the end of their life. Recycling the nets is said to reduce emissions by 49% and energy use by 15% vs. using virgin nylon materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Path to Carbon Neutrality</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-Friedmann-Ohse.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-Friedmann-Ohse.jpeg\" alt=\"reTyre World's First Carbon-Neutral Tire Friedmann Ohse\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-Friedmann-Ohse.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-Friedmann-Ohse-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-Friedmann-Ohse-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-Friedmann-Ohse-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-Friedmann-Ohse-1200x675.jpeg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/ReTyre)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The person who is leading the Carbon Neutral Tire Project at ReTyre is Froiedemann Ohse. He elaborates on the meticulous process that goes into achieving carbon neutrality. “<em>The product carbon footprint of this tire is based on our third-party verified LCA, including the end-of-life, which is how we measure all our products. Our production and transportation processes are optimized to be close to zero emissions</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohse continues, “<em>End-of-life is reduced to almost zero due to the recycling of the tires. The algae used in the tire has a negative CO2 equivalent, balancing any remaining emissions to achieve a net-zero impact. In this way, we have a carbon-neutral product without using any of the well-known shortcuts, such as carbon quotas, subsidies, or other non-product related contributions.</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Global Effort in ReTyre Carbon-Neutral tires</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-the-Bio-Based-Tire.jpeg\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-the-Bio-Based-Tire.jpeg\" alt=\"reTyre World's First Carbon-Neutral Tire the Bio-Based Tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-the-Bio-Based-Tire.jpeg 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-the-Bio-Based-Tire-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-the-Bio-Based-Tire-90x120.jpeg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-the-Bio-Based-Tire-768x1024.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/ReTyre)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ReTyre collaborates with global suppliers to responsibly source their materials.
