major tech upsets, with both Canyon riders on the podium running the Ultimate road bike, road gearing and road pedals.</p>\n<p>For 2023, the UCI listened to the beleaguered gravel specialists and made some last-minute route changes, making this year’s course rougher and tougher.</p>\n<p>Riders were split between excitement and apprehension over the change, with the tech looking – generally speaking – much more gravel-like this year.</p>\n<p>In this roundup, we’ve got new and unreleased bikes, car park aero hacks, gearing that will make your knees ache and what we have to assume is the fastest tyre setup available.</p>\n<section>\n    <div>\n        <p><strong>Words</strong>: Tom Hardie</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>\n\n<h2>New bikes from Canyon and Merida</h2>\n<div>\n
