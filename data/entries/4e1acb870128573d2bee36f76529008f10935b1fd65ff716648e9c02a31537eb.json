{"title":"'British Cycling has done everything for me' - Dani Rowe: From a talent ID programme to Olympic gold","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/dani-rowe-champion-cyclist-passionate-advocate-and-determined-trailblazer","date":1730883609000,"content":"\n      <p><span>British cycling has had a surge of world-class talent over the years, and few have made as profound an impact as Dani Rowe. Rising through the ranks alongside celebrated athletes, Rowe’s name became synonymous with poise and power on the track and the road. Her crowning achievement came at the 2012 London Olympics, where she claimed gold in the women’s team pursuit alongside Laura Kenny and Joanna Rowsell, setting a new world record on their way to golden glory. This historic victory not only marked a career-defining moment for Rowe but also a major milestone in British cycling history. </span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>“The London 2012 Olympics is my career highlight, it’s something that I always dreamt of as a young girl. I was always obsessed with sport, I didn’t care what sport I was in when I was younger, I just dreamed of being a world or Olympic champion,” Rowe says.</span></p>\n<p><span>“The Olympics is the pinnacle, I watched the Olympics every four years when it was on, my dad competed in two winter Olympic Games and it’s just something that I dreamed of. To be able to do that alongside two amazing women in Laura and Joanna, we built such a bond on and off the bikes and had such an amazing bond between each other, I get goosebumps talking about it, it was a dream come true. It was such an honour in my home country as well and to have the support around us who it wouldn’t have been possible without, winning was just the icing on the cake.”</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AB3_8101_1024x1024.jpg?v=1730724918\" /></div>\n<p><span>Born in Hampshire, Rowe entered professional cycling as a teenager. At 14, her potential was spotted when the British Cycling Talent Team programme visited her college. She initially joined as a sprint cyclist but found her true strength in endurance track cycling. Inspired by her father, a two-time Olympian in biathlon, Rowe put in relentless hard work and dedication, rising steadily through the ranks. Her grit led her not only to Olympic glory but also to three consecutive world titles in the women’s team pursuit (2011, 2012, and 2013), numerous European titles, and multiple British medals.</span></p>\n<p><span>“British Cycling has done everything for me. I wasn’t into cycling before I started on the pathway, I was a swimmer and runner before British Cycling came into my school when I was 14 and then I worked my way up from there,” Rowe smiles. “I’ve got everything to thank them for, it’s <a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/talentdevelopment\">a brilliant programme that helps young people reach their potential</a>. It’s a shame that the Talent ID programme doesn’t happen anymore but at the same time it’s also a huge positive within cycling that actually they can find enough talent through clubs alone. It’s fantastic what they have done and what they are still achieving.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Rowe’s own success extended beyond the track, as she consistently earned podium finishes on the road. Competing in prestigious WorldTour races like<a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/strade-bianche-everything-you-need-to-know\"> Strade Bianche</a> Donne, Omloop het Nieuwsblad, the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-of-flanders-all-the-essential-info-for-the-flemish-monument\">Tour of Flanders</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/liege-bastogne-liege-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-oldest-monument\">Liège-Bastogne-Liège</a>, she proved her versatility and endurance. Highlights include a third-place finish in the 2013 National Championships Road Race, followed by second places in 2014 and 2018. Her </span><i><span>palmarès</span></i><span> also includes a 9th-place overall finish in La Route de France (2016), 3rd in the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race (2016), 4th in the Santos Women’s Tour (2016), 9th in Omloop Het Nieuwsblad (2017), and 3rd in the OVO Energy Women’s Tour (2018).</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AW3_1509_1024x1024.jpg?v=1730724951\" /></div>\n<p><span>In recognition of her contribution to British sport, Rowe was awarded an MBE in 2013. This honour highlighted her dedication, not only to cycling, but to inspiring future generations, solidifying her status as a respected figure in the UK’s sporting legacy. In 2024, the 33-year-old was inducted into the <a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/about/article/20241024-13-NEW-INDUCTEES-INTO-THE-BRITISH-CYCLING-HALL-OF-FAME-0\">British Cycling Hall of Fame.</a></span></p>\n<p><span>“It was a massive shock and real privilege to be inducted,” Rowe says. “It was such a sense of pride. It’s never something I imagined when I started in my cycling career and to be amongst such massive names in the cycling world, I feel a bit of imposter syndrome. At the same time, when I think back to what an amazing journey I’ve had through my career I feel really proud.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Rowe retired from professional racing in 2018, after dedicating 14 years to the sport, but her impact on cycling endures. A vocal advocate for women’s sports, she co-owns Rowe &amp; King, a cycling coaching service founded with her husband, Matt Rowe. She also shares her expertise as a commentator on Eurosport, where her insights bring valuable perspectives to audiences, amplifying the visibility of women in sport and advocating for greater support and equality.</span></p>\n<p><span>Rowe’s journey from an Olympic champion to a respected mentor and advocate embodies the legacy she leaves behind in British cycling. Her passion, resilience, and continued dedication to the sport inspire the next generation of cyclists and ensure her place among Britain’s cherished sporting icons.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"4e1acb870128573d2bee36f76529008f10935b1fd65ff716648e9c02a31537eb","category":"Cycling"}
