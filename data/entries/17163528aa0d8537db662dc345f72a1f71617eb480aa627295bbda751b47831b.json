Fortnite’s\ncounterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\nled players to incur unwanted charges based on the press of a\nsingle button. The company also made it easy for children to make\npurchases while playing Fortnite without requiring any parental\nconsent. According to the FTC’s complaint, Epic also locked the\naccounts of customers who disputed unauthorized charges with their\ncredit card companies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure would be great if Apple were forced to allow these guys to run an entire app store for iOS.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/15/ftc-finalizes-epic-games-penalty\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"17163528aa0d8537db662dc345f72a1f71617eb480aa627295bbda751b47831b","category":"Tech"}
