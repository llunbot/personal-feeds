Tinkerers in the Repack era would widen the chainstays by hammering in a baseball or a block of wood to cold set the rear triangle so they could cram in bigger tires. Other off-road modifications included repacking the coaster hubs with higher-viscosity greases, building stronger wheels from 26″ BMX bikes, swapping out the newsboy handlebars for a Cinelli 1A stem and motorcycle bar, then taking the bikes to bomb down fire roads, oftentimes with no brakes.</p>\n<p><img width=\"1707\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0073-1-scaled.jpg?fit=1200,2560&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0073-1-scaled.jpg?w=1707&amp;quality=75 1707w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0073-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0073-1-scaled.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0073-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,2700&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0073-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,2003&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0073-1-scaled.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0073-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1365,2048&amp;quality=75 1365w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0005.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0005.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0005.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0005.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0005.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0005.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0005.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/08/IMG0005.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photos: <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/wende-cragg-early-mountain-bike-photos/\" target=\"_blank\">Wende Cragg</a></em></p>\n<p>These were mountain cruisers.

Then came the old French derailleurs, Japanese shifters, German brake levers, and French brake calipers to continue stretching the limits of these old frames. Those were known as klunkers. But nothing is as visually striking as a proper coaster or mountain cruiser.</p>\n<p><em>These bikes are still very sketchy to ride on technical terrain.

These are “Small Batch Straight Bar” bikes brazed in Silver City, New Mexico (in the back of a bread truck, as Cjell likes to point out), and the framesets start at $2,150. They’re simple, relying only on a rear coaster brake, and clear a 2.6″ 29er tire. The geometry is playful, the stance is classic, and the styling is vintage-inspired. They’re fillet brazed, just like the old cruisers from the 1940s, using Cjell’s signature style of fat, overlapping fillets.</p>\n<p>Cjell has me on an “L/XL” sized SB2. The two sizes he has available are small/medium and large/x-large. Not that you need a coaster cruiser that fits like a glove but he wanted to make a bigger size for big riders to get the most out of their experience (and money.) You can see the geometry for the S/M and L/XL frames SB2 at <a href=\"https://www.monebikes.com/store/v2b3gom6nbluv8jqfluo0ciiexsj30\" target=\"_blank\">MoneBikes.com</a>.</p>\n<p>When Cjell opened these up for order, I immediately bought one. It was about time I owned a Mone, and a coaster cruiser felt more than appropriate. Cari’s family has ties to Silver City. Her grandparents were married at the church in town, and her grandmother wore an all-black dress. Her family owned a ranch in the Gila and spent time between there, Magdalena and Española. Needless to say, New Mexico is our home now, and it’s about time I supported a local framebuilder!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-24.jpg?fit=1200%2C1334&amp;quality=75&amp;resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-24.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-24.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-24.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-24.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I requested that Cjell braze a rattlesnake to the chainstay to act as a stay protector when the chain slaps, but otherwise this frame is a stock SB2 in terms of details and construction. The L/XL has 55 mm of bottom bracket drop, a 66º head angle, a 73º seat angle, an effective top tube of 637 mm, and a 459 mm chainstay. The frame clears a 29 x 2.6″ tire with about 1/4″ of space on either side. The rear end is spaced 135 mm, and the front 100 mm.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-13.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-13.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-13.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-15-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C1334&amp;quality=75&amp;resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-15-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-15-1.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-15-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-15-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The rear dropout has a direct mount for the coaster hub’s laser-cut actuator arm, as well as an ISO tab for a disc brake if you ever want to go singlespeed with a rear brake. The Monē coaster hubs use a 15 mm axle nut, perfect for <a href=\"https://shop.theradavist.com/products/tools-paragon-machine-works-and-the-radavist-titanium-1-headset-locknut-wrench\" target=\"_blank\">our Paragon Machine Works wrenches</a>! If you want front and rear brakes, Cjell would have to make you a tri or bi-plane fork, as the SB2 fork is too spindly to withstand the braking forces of a disc brake. The fork blades are the same approximate diameter as those 22.2 mm handlebars!</p>\n<p><em>I almost asked him to put canti or rollercam studs on this one! </em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-21.jpg?fit=1200%2C1334&amp;quality=75&amp;resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-21.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-21.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-21.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Now for the elephant in the room. Instead of opting for Cjell’s signature clear coat or turbo midnight finish, I got my SB2 powder coated by Cjell’s finisher, Karl. It’s the same Prismatic Powder color I used on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/what-almost-was-the-mystic-alluvium-27-5-hardtail-mtb/\" target=\"_blank\">my old Mystic Alluvium</a> bike and a finish Bruce Gordon used to spec: <a href=\"https://l.instagram.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prismaticpowders.com%2Fshop%2Fpowder-coating-colors%2FUTB-5223%2Frustic-texture&amp;e=AT04gLZdJD6Yel1sBrK2cIkc8bt6Tk1qj3mdNXJ5qr9g_36WUVZaXNeUpvTEqCKZ4UQql3WQQBLkaP_wVCShhz7OBYNyy6F-sFA8xRJnzmRm1Ol70AwpP94Ohze75hwfpcIoDKubGLU1Nwn4JHiRSLSU9J3w\" target=\"_blank\">Rustic Texture</a>.

They’re made in Kathmandu by an artisan in a street stand. When Cjell was visiting, he was walking around trying to find a jeweler to make head badges. Eventually, he found this young guy named Binod who was into making them for Cjell. One of the batches was finished when our mutual friend Chris “Dirty” was in Kathmandu so Dirty brought them back to the US for Cjell.

Still, this is a mountain bike with a mountain chain line, so running a set of Profile or BMX cranks would have taken some finagling to get the chain line right. The bike likes having a bit of chain slack, too, as evident in the photos. No matter how hard I tighten the axle nuts, the chain always looks like that but it never gets any looser.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"4000\" height=\"1942\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/TiresPushing.jpg?fit=1200,1942&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/TiresPushing.jpg?w=4000&amp;quality=75 4000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/TiresPushing.jpg?resize=1200,583&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/TiresPushing.jpg?resize=2000,971&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/TiresPushing.jpg?resize=768,373&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/TiresPushing.jpg?resize=1536,746&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/TiresPushing.jpg?resize=2048,994&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Look at those Kessel 2.6″ tires folding and gripping!</em></p>\n<h3>Controlled Chaos</h3>\n<p>Unlike the plumes of dust pummeling down the Repack run shown in Wende’s photos at the top of the article, I like to ride my SB2 without locking up the hub.

Sort of like how you feather the brakes on a normal mountain bike. You don’t lock up the brakes every time you want to slow down on your mountain bike, right? The same technique applies to coaster brakes.

The photos of a “flow trail” here in Santa Fe are merely the tires kicking up dust as I lean onto their edges, pushing against the tire’s casing; I’m not actually skidding anything. In fact, I wasn’t even applying any braking pressure here.</p>\n<p>This is why I love coaster cruisers. They teach you how to go faster on trails without braking into turns or corners, and that’s something you can apply to any bike. Just the other day, I was able to make it down a favorite trail here without braking at all. And now, because of this practice, I’m faster on that same trail on my normal mountain bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-6.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-6.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-6.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-6.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>This is also why I enjoy riding a rigid mountain bike–vibing with the trail, not “owning” it–is simply amplified with a coaster cruiser. I push into the corners by leaning in more, and then snap the bike into position. Cjell’s masterful engineering of the tubing spec used gives the bike a spring-like feeling in this terrain. The fork flexes, the rear end has some give, and it’s all amplified by the ability of me to push the edges of the tires to their traction limit.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-3.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-3.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-3.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/Mone-Bikes-SB2-Coaster-Cruiser-Review-3.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>With the right amount of tire pressure, the bike flies on trails. The 860 mm wide Inter-Am flat track handlebars add to this feeling with their flex and give.
