Nineteen years later, the two shared a stage at the VivaTech Conference to reflect on Amazon’s history of innovation—from pioneering the pay-as-you-go model with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> to transforming customer experiences using “good old-fashioned AI”—as well as what really keeps them up at night in the age of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/\">generative artificial intelligence (generative AI)</a>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/09/Life-at-AWS-eb-swamiwerner-hero.4557b7db9a66f8377e4abda9dc9611ba0c34c6a1.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /></p> \n<p>Asked if competitors ever kept him up at night, Dr. Werner insisted that listening to customer needs—such as guardrails, security, and privacy—and building products based on those needs is what drives success at Amazon. Dr. Swami said he viewed <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/pm/sagemaker/\">Amazon SageMaker</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a> as prime examples of successful products that have emerged as a result of this customer-first approach. “If you end up chasing your competitors, you are going to end up building what they are building,” he added. “If you actually listen to your customers, you are actually going to lead the way in innovation.” To learn four more lessons on customer-obsessed innovation, visit our <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/careers/life-at-aws-four-lessons-on-customer-obsessed-innovation-from-two-amazon-leaders/?trk=8b08cf2c-62d8-4915-9baf-67b8c25d58ef&amp;sc_channel=sm\">AWS Careers blog</a>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/09/CJ_Moses.jpeg\" width=\"107\" height=\"160\" />For example, for customer-obsessed security, we build and use Mithra, a powerful neural network model to detect and respond to cyber threats. It analyzes up to 200 trillion internet domain requests daily from the AWS global network, identifying an average of 182,000 new malicious domains with remarkable accuracy. Mithra is just one example of how AWS uses global scale, advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technology, and constant innovation to lead the way in cloud security, making the internet safer for everyone.
