{"title":"Goodbye HomePod Mini in Space Gray; Hello HomePod Mini in Midnight","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/07/apple-introduces-homepod-mini-in-midnight/","date":1721064445000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Today, Apple introduced HomePod mini in midnight, made with 100\npercent recycled mesh fabric. At just 3.3 inches tall, HomePod\nmini offers big sound in an impressively compact design. With a\nseamless, acoustically transparent mesh exterior and a backlit\ntouch surface that illuminates from edge to edge, HomePod mini is\na stunning smart speaker that complements any space. HomePod mini\nin midnight is available starting Wednesday, July 17, and joins\nother bold colors, including yellow, orange, blue, and white.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This confused me for a moment, because they make it sound like they’re simply adding this new color to the lineup. But midnight is actually <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePod_Mini\">replacing the subtly different space gray</a>. The bigger question: is this a sign that a second-gen HomePod Mini is not coming soon? The current models debuted in November 2020, and are powered by the S5 chip from Apple Watch Series 5.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thinking about this some more, it’s kind of odd that it took Apple this long to swap space gray for midnight with the HomePod Mini. For consumer-y products they shifted from space gray to dark-with-a-slight-hint-of-blue “midnight” starting, I think, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-reveals-apple-watch-series-7-featuring-the-largest-most-advanced-display/\">with the Series 7 Apple Watch models in 2021</a>. (The <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/09/apple-watch-series-6-delivers-breakthrough-wellness-and-fitness-capabilities/\">Series 6 lineup</a> introduced a dark blue, but it was called “blue”, and there was still a color called space gray.) The entry model MacBook Pros still offer space gray for their dark option, but the higher-end models are either silver or space <em>black</em>. Dark iPad Pros are space black. And the second-gen full-size HomePods, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/01/apple-introduces-the-new-homepod-with-breakthrough-sound-and-intelligence/\">introduced in January 2023</a>, have only ever been offered in white and midnight. The dark MacBook Airs have been offered in midnight ever since <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/06/apple-unveils-all-new-macbook-air-supercharged-by-the-new-m2-chip/\">the new form factor debuted with the M2 models in 2022</a>. Makes me wonder if Apple produced a bunch of space gray HomePod Minis all at once, when the product debuted, and has been waiting for them to sell out before switching to midnight.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/15/homepod-mini-midnight\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1ac732eec4035382808bcbb4db53facf68ab28c8fff04e5dea1fa21e9e1788ac","category":"Tech"}
