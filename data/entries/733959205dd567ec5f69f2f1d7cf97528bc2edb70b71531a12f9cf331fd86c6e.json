The S9 chip has 60 percent more transistors than the S8 chip in the Series 8, and it processes machine learning tasks up to 2x faster.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the S9 chip, there's a new Double Tap gesture (coming in October). Double Tap lets you double tap your index finger and thumb together to answer a call, play and pause music, open a notification, and more. It uses the various sensors in the Apple Watch and it works surprisingly well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth the Series 9 and Ultra 2 have brighter displays (2,000 nits and 3,000 nits maximum, respectively) for better performance in the sun, and they can drop down to 1 nit at night or when you're in a movie theater. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> requests are also now processed on device, and ‌Siri‌ can answer health questions like how well you slept or what your heart rate is at.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's also a new U2 chip that can be used for finding your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> with Precision Finding, and dictation is 25 percent more accurate. All of the new models come with an increased 64GB of storage space, up from 32GB.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple added a new pink aluminum color for the ‌Apple Watch Series 9‌, which is an attractive shade, plus the watch comes in starlight, midnight, and PRODUCT(RED). The stainless steel models are available in graphite, gold, and silver.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watch models can be preordered starting today, and will launch on September 22 alongside the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> models.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-watch-ultra-2-series-9-hands-on/\">Hands-On With the New Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hands-on-with-the-new-apple-watch-series-9-and-apple-watch-ultra-2-models.2401372/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"733959205dd567ec5f69f2f1d7cf97528bc2edb70b71531a12f9cf331fd86c6e","category":"Apple"}
