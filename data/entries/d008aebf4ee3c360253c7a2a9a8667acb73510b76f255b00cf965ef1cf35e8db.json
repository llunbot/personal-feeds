One person shows some ingenuity with the device by demonstrating in a YouTube video how he was able to modify the Mac mini so that it can be powered through a USB-C port instead of its power supply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the video, Saad Ouache shows an open Mac mini with a wired USB-connector that he added and says uses Power Delivery to run the computer. He then connects a 12-volt battery power bank and proceeds to switch the power connection from the power cable to USB-C.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the video has not been verified, it doesn’t seem impossible to power the Mac mini via USB-C. However, the power demands of the device make it impractical. Apple’s <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/103253\">documentation</a> states that the M4 Mac mini has a maximum power consumption of 65W, while the M4 Pro Mac mini is at 140W. Those numbers are with a Mac mini with no devices connected to it. The maximum continuous power rating for the Mac mini is 155W, which comes into play when a connected device is not using an external power source and is relying on the USB-C connection to the Mac mini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of this is surprising, of course. The MacBook Air and Pro already deliver power over USB-C, with the MacBook Pro powering an M4 Max and a 16-inch mini-LED display over USB-C. But Apple hasn’t yet offered a way to run its desktop Macs with USB-C power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/05/04/its-tough-but-you-can-hack-a-m4-mac-mini-to-get-power-over-usb-c\">AppleInsider</a> points out, for Apple to make a Mac mini that runs on USB-C power, the proper cable needs to be used, which would be a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MYQT3AM/A/240w-usb-c-charge-cable-2-m\">240W USB-C Charge Cable</a>. Using lower-rated cables would be possible, but that increases the risk of failure. This restriction doesn’t seem like one Apple would want the hassle of dealing with. But if you have a creative idea for a Mac mini and are looking for alternative ways to power the device on the go, Ouache’s video seems to prove it’s possible.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d008aebf4ee3c360253c7a2a9a8667acb73510b76f255b00cf965ef1cf35e8db","category":"Apple"}
