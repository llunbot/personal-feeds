There was one young guy who oversaw \"IT\" for all four sites, and he occasionally tried to impose IT-like rules, like making us change our publication software passwords every few weeks. Did \"password1234\" protect our ink-stained souls, whereas \"password123\" would have meant doom? Who can say?</p>\n<p>I chafed at this occasional performative security. In a fit of pique, I decided my rotating password scheme would be the IT manager's license plate, followed by whatever I had for lunch that day. I thought myself quite clever, even if, a few months later, I forgot I had typed in \"turkeyhoagie\" instead of \"turkeysub\" earlier that new-password day, and I had to call said IT manager for a reset. I have no idea if he saw my password before he provided the replacement. I still felt clever, even in defeat.</p>\n<p>\"Clever, yet defeated\" came rushing back to me as I marched through <a href=\"https://neal.fun/password-game/\">The Password Game</a>, a web-based text box of tears from Neal Agarwal. The game has been trending its way through social media since <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nealagarwal/status/1673703594778927105\">its official release yesterday</a>, and understandably so. We only get so many of these \"Pure enjoyment on the web\" moments each year, so I recommend you avail yourself of it as soon as you can.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950545#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950545&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"491e222fdb1f121f95a8b2b4a26255d0e113dd52ca49a5c4800f21046aa0a9fe","category":"Tech"}
