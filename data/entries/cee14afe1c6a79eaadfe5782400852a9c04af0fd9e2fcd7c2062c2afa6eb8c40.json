Members prescribed Wegovy paid a co-pay of between $30 and $50 per month for the drug, while the plan's cost was around $800 a month.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999703#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999703&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cee14afe1c6a79eaadfe5782400852a9c04af0fd9e2fcd7c2062c2afa6eb8c40","category":"Tech"}
