Today, he said Apple is \"giving this notion more thought\" again.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis time around, he said Apple has yet to start engineering work, so ads in the Apple Maps app might still be a ways away.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAds in the Apple Maps app would not be the traditional banner ads that you see on websites, but rather paid search results. For example, a fast food chain could pay Apple to appear near the top of the results when a user searches for \"burgers\" or \"fries.\" Many similar apps already offer search ads, including Google Maps, Waze, and Yelp.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple already displays search ads in the App Store, allowing developers to pay to promote their apps to users who search for relevant keywords.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAds in the Apple Maps app would further boost Apple's services revenue.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/16/apple-maps-might-start-showing-ads/\">Apple Maps Might Start Showing Ads</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-maps-might-start-showing-ads.2449489/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7e85ee3df762c512a939e048b0f7099ebad4b029732aae81e1a096f4d92a9bdc","category":"Apple"}
