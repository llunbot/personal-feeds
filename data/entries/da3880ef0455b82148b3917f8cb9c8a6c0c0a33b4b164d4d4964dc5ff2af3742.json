Apple TV+ responded with a tweet saying that it has a team of 2,000 lawyers furiously baking. It would be humorous if Apple actually delivered on the promise, but sadly the actors have yet to follow up with any evidence.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Thank you so much for your reasonable arbitration request, Rob.
