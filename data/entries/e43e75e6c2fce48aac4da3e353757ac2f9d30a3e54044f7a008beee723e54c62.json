Nokia is tackling the lower end of the market by releasing a $249.99 tablet with a 10.4-inch display.</p>\n<p>Let's talk about the specs. The SoC is a Unisoc Tiger T610 (a Unisoc SoC is a <em>rare</em> component); it's a 12 nm chip with two A75 cores at 1.8 GHz and six A55 cores at 1.8 GHz. The main A75 cores are pretty old and were last seen in major flagships with the Snapdragon 845 in 2017, so this is an entry-level chip. There are 4GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and a pretty big 8200 mAh battery. The display is a 10.4-inch LCD with a 2000×1200 resolution and a \"toughened glass\" (read: not the usual Gorilla Glass) cover. The back is aluminum, and there's a microSD slot, stereo speakers, a front and back camera, a USB-C port with 15 W charging, and a headphone jack. There's no fingerprint sensor.</p>\n<p>$249.99 gets you the Wi-Fi-only model, but an unpriced LTE version is also listed on the spec page. Nokia is selling a kickstand folio case for an unknown amount. The device ships with Android 11 and comes with two years of major OS updates and three years of security updates.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801600#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801600&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e43e75e6c2fce48aac4da3e353757ac2f9d30a3e54044f7a008beee723e54c62","category":"Tech"}
