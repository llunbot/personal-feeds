The cover does not block any of the sensors or buttons on the Vision Pro, so it can be left on the device at all times, which is useful for VR games and activities that might lead you into walls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDbrand developed the case after seeing a 3D printed version from Kyle Goodrich, a former AR designer at Snap. Apple bundles the Vision Pro with a protective cover, but Apple's cover is designed to be in place only while the Vision Pro isn't being worn.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/dbrand-vision-pro-battery-case.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" />\r<br />\nThe Aperture Faceplate is being sold alongside a separate Aperture Battery Holster that matches the design of the cover while also adding a clip to attach it to an item of clothing while the Vision Pro is in use. Both the Battery Holster and the Faceplate are available in black or orange.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Aperture Faceplate alone is priced at $49, while the combo is $69.
