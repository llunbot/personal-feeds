That’s a lot of adventure to pack into a week!</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>“The Downhill was probably the funnest thing I have ever done, dirt in my mouth, bugs in my teeth, it was awesome! This has broadened my experience and opened my eyes to what more you can really push yourself to do. For sure it was an adventure race”!</strong></em></p>\n<p>~ Holly Schellenberg – Winner, 30+ Women</p></blockquote>\n<p>The South Okanagan provided the perfect canvas to re-imagine what a gravel bike is truly capable of.
