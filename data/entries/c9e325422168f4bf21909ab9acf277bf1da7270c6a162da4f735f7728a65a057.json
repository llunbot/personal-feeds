The first option is impractical, and the second often gives you low-quality results. iScanner gives you a third option. This iOS scanner app can create high quality scans of any document type, and a lifetime subscription just went on sale for $24.99 (reg. $199). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This mobile scanner app is a life-saver if you need a scanner in a hurry. Just hover your phone camera over your documents, and the app captures a perfect scan in seconds. AI will automatically straighten pages and crop borders. Then, you can use the built-in PDF editor to fill out your information, add your signature, and save in any file format you need — there’s no more need to print, fill out, and scan your documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iScanner has some other tricks up its sleeve. Capture or upload photos and have it solve math problems, count objects, or measure the area of a room for home improvement projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>April 27 at 11:59 p.m. PT is the deadline to get an <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription&amp;utm_term=scsf-616331&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003Up8DIAS&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">iScanner lifetime subscription</a> on sale for $24.99. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription&amp;utm_term=scsf-616331&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003Up8DIAS&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp1.stackassets.com/49bbc2d3be0a43fd04537f5a198f3b5c920af726/store/c8771d986c57cffd8f4d4db680d8eeef1bc7513707f3374ab9b579fb5159/sale_297719_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iScanner App: Lifetime Subscription – $24.99</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription&amp;utm_term=scsf-616331&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003Up8DIAS&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change. </em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c9e325422168f4bf21909ab9acf277bf1da7270c6a162da4f735f7728a65a057","category":"Apple"}
