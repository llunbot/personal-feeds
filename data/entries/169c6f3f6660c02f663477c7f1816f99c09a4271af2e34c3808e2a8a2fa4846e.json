Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-the-redesigned-11-inch-and-all-new-13-inch-ipad-air-with-m2/\">said</a> at the time that the 13-inch model delivers \"even better sound quality\" with double the bass, which is \"great for enjoying music and videos.\" However, there is no mention of the feature in Apple's device specifications for the new M3 variant. In fact, the 13-inch iPad Air with M2 chip is the only iPad that has ever included the feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has never provided specific technical details about the audio effect in the 13-inch M2 iPad Air, so we don't yet know if its removal in the successor device is due to a hardware change or something else. Perhaps a future device teardown will provide some clues.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/m3-ipad-air-no-double-bass-effect.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1354\" height=\"452\" /><div><em>Apple's iPad Air device specification comparison tool</em></div>\r<br />\nWith the M3 chip, the new iPad Air should offer up to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-chip-benchmark-results/\">20% faster performance</a> compared to the previous-generation model. The M3 chip also brings hardware-accelerated ray tracing to the iPad Air for the first time, providing improved graphics rendering in games. The new iPad Air is available to <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-air\">pre-order</a>, and it will launch on March 12. In the U.S., the 11-inch model continues to start at $599, and the 13-inch model continues to start at $799. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/\">M3</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/13-inch-ipad-air-m3-chip-no-double-bass/\">Apple Removes Audio Feature From New 13-Inch iPad Air With M3 Chip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-removes-audio-feature-from-new-13-inch-ipad-air-with-m3-chip.2451828/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"169c6f3f6660c02f663477c7f1816f99c09a4271af2e34c3808e2a8a2fa4846e","category":"Apple"}
