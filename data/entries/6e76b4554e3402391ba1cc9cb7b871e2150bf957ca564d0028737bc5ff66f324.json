However, the real-world viability of that wee bundle was saddled with terminally short longevity: just 110 miles (177 km) of range. For 2025, Mini is leaning into electrification in a big way. Next year's Cooper E and SE carry on that, emissions-free legacy, now with some decent range to match.</p>\n<p>Mini has done some re-shuffling of its models and trims, so let's start by sorting that out. First up is the Mini Cooper, which going forward is the name for the three- or five-door configurations, including the Convertible. While there are gas-burning Cooper and Cooper S models coming, today Mini is only unveiling the purely electric Cooper E and SE, which will be built on a wholly different platform.</p>\n<p>Those Coopers will be available in four, purely cosmetic trims: Essential, Classic, Favoured, and JCW (which features black logos, racing stripes, and a Chili Red roof).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965027#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965027&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6e76b4554e3402391ba1cc9cb7b871e2150bf957ca564d0028737bc5ff66f324","category":"Tech"}
