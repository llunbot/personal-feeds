Many of them also love the precision delivered by Chris King. Pair those two together, and you’ve got a match made in heaven. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/chris-king-espresso-tampers-return/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris King has been making espresso tampers</a> on and off for years, typically in small batches that always sold out quickly. Now, the tampers are back but with a meaningful update – a 15mm shorter handle. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-2.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-2-1536x1920.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-2-1536x1920.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-2-240x300.webp 240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-2-96x120.webp 96w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-2-768x960.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-2-1229x1536.webp 1229w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-2.webp 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-1.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-1-1536x1920.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-1-1536x1920.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-1-240x300.webp 240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-1-96x120.webp 96w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-1-768x960.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-1-1229x1536.webp 1229w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper-LS-1.webp 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to lead Designer and Coffee Guru Jay SyCip, “Pulling the perfect shot of espresso isn’t easy. Some might even say it’s an art form. Would the Mona Lisa be in the Louvre today if Leonardo DaVinci had used a chicken bone to paint it? For coffee lovers around the world, that perfect shot of espresso can be the difference between a good day and a bad one.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>SyCip continues, “We recognize that a technique used by many exceptional baristas is using their fingertips to gauge the levelness of the tamper piston against the outer edge of the porta-filter and longer handles can get in the way. Making this change will allow for better more precise control for all baristas. It’s a small thing, but we felt it was important.” </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-14-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-14-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-14-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-14-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-14-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-14-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-14-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-14-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-14-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-16-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-16-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-16-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-16-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-16-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-16-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-16-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-16-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tamper_2025-16-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, the new tamper is 70mm tall, still with a 58mm base diameter and a depth of 10mm.
