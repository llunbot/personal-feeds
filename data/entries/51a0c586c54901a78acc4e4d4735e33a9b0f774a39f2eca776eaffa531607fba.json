The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> ‌Photos‌ app is able to detect people in extreme poses, people wearing accessories, and people with occluded faces.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo do this, Apple uses a combination of face and upper body to match people whose faces are not visible. Apple's machine learning blog says that the new functionality improves the ‌Photos‌ experience by identifying people in situations where it was previously impossible.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's <a href=\"https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/recognizing-people-photos\">blog post</a> on recognizing people in photos through on-device machine learning goes into much greater detail on how Apple uses machine learning to identify people while still protecting user privacy, and it's well worth a read for those who are interested in the inner workings of ML features.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/23/photos-people-recognition-ios-15/\">Apple Explains How the Photos People Recognition Feature Has Improved in iOS 15</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explains-how-the-photos-people-recognition-feature-has-improved-in-ios-15.2305256/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=uDUIYwic2Os:TeV8AZ2r7aw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=uDUIYwic2Os:TeV8AZ2r7aw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/uDUIYwic2Os\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"51a0c586c54901a78acc4e4d4735e33a9b0f774a39f2eca776eaffa531607fba","category":"Apple"}
