Williams has been designing products for companies like Amazon, Walmart, and Samsung for over 20 years, but now is reaching out straight to outdoor enthusiasts like us to ease our woes…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a funny coincidence that this product idea crossed my desk, as I just recently checked my own hydration packs and got a nasty reminder to do this more often!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>DRYE fan ventilates your hydration bladder to prevent growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-in-reservoir.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1363\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-in-reservoir.webp\" alt=\"DRYE fan, in reservoir\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-in-reservoir.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-in-reservoir-264x300.webp 264w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-in-reservoir-106x120.webp 106w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-in-reservoir-768x872.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(All images / DRYE)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re wondering why DRYE has an ‘E’ added to the end, it’s because the name stands for Don’t Ruin Your Equipment! The DRYE Fan reduces reservoir drying time to hours instead of days, minimizing any chance for bacteria and mold to grow. With the fan, it takes about an hour per liter for a reservoir to dry.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The DRYE kit is currently compatible with certain CamelBak and Gregory reservoirs, but more brand compatibility is coming soon. The Kickstarter page specifically names Osprey, HydraPak, Platypus, and Salomon as additional future options. The fan requires a special DRYE Ring which mates the fan to the reservoir; and currently only rings for CamelBak Crux and Antidote, or Gregory 3D reservoirs are ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DRYE Drying Fan and Kit Components:</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-1.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-1.webp\" alt=\"DRYE fan\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-1.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-1-297x228.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-1-120x92.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-1-768x589.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The DRYE Fan unit is pocket-sized electric fan with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, charged via USB-C. Charging time is 2-3 hours, and that will get you the following runtimes: 12 hours on low, 8 hours on medium, and 4 hours on max speed. So at least a few dried bladders between recharges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fan offers three speed settings, and a built-in timer that can be set to run it for 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours. When running, the fan is powerful enough to inflate the reservoir, ensuring every bit of the inside gets dry. Moisture then escapes from vent holes on the sides of the attachment ring.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Ring-crux.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"739\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Ring-crux.webp\" alt=\"DRYE ring\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Ring-crux.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Ring-crux-297x183.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Ring-crux-120x74.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Ring-crux-768x473.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The DRYE Ring itself attaches the fan securely to the reservoir. On the outside, the fan attaches to the ring via a bayonet connection. The other side of the ring threads onto the reservoir in place of its regular cap.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Wire-w-cloths.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1030\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Wire-w-cloths.webp\" alt=\"DRYE wire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Wire-w-cloths.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Wire-w-cloths-297x255.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Wire-w-cloths-120x103.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Wire-w-cloths-768x659.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The kit also comes with a 3’/1m long DRYE Wire, made from a flexible stainless steel coil, to clean and dry the inside of your drinking hose with small reusable (&amp; washable) microfiber cloths. The wire does not have a typical brush on the end, it has a slot specifically designed to hold the small bits of cloth. 10 pieces of cloth are included with each wire, after which you can get creative with wiping down the inside of your hose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DRYE Fan Kit – Kickstarter pricing, options &amp; timeline</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-kit-vertical.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1945\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-kit-vertical.webp\" alt=\"DRYE Fan kit, vertical\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-kit-vertical.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-kit-vertical-185x300.webp 185w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-kit-vertical-74x120.webp 74w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-kit-vertical-768x1245.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRYE-Fan-kit-vertical-948x1536.webp 948w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The DRYE fan is available through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign now. It hasn’t yet taken off, even though we think it’s kind of a great idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selling for $30, the complete DRYE kit includes a DRYE Fan, a DRYE ring, a DRYE Hook to hang the reservoir, and a DRYE Wire. <em>Note</em>: DRYE only sells kits currently with CamelBak Crux compatible rings – the most common screw-type CamelBak bladder opening for many years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the complete DRYE Kit, each piece is available separately. This is good news for those with CamelBak Antidote or Gregory 3D reservoirs, as you can simply assemble a kit (only missing the hook) for a dollar less than the Crux kit’s MSRP. Individually, DRYE sells the fan for $15, the rings for $7 each, and the DRYE Wire for $7. Please also note DRYE lists prices as ‘discounted introductory’ on the Kickstarter page, with 25-36% claimed savings off eventual retail pricing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DRYE Fan’s <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dryefan/faster-drying-for-hydration-bladders?ref=esqryl&amp;token=0a8cdd55\">Kickstarter campaign</a> ends May 29<sup>th</sup>. If they meet their ambitious funding goal, estimated product delivery is June or July. Shipping is available to the USA, Canada, and Mexico only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-drye-fan-aims-to-make-cleaning-hydration-pack-reservoirs-a-breeze/\">The DRYE Fan Aims to Make Cleaning Hydration Pack Reservoirs a Breeze</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ed9e629fbc1194bdfe3083bb3e5fefb0d2f6c49ec7f00e81c782e120ebd9372f","category":"Cycling"}
