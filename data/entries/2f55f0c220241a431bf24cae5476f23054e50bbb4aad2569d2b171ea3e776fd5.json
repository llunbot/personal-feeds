And now that carriers have begun flipping the switches on the service, users are eagerly testing out the feature with their Android friends‚Äîand everyone is loving it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it‚Äôs not nearly as full-featured as iMessage (and non-Apple devices will still be designated with green bubbles), RCS messaging brings several features users have wanted for years, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Typing indicators</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Read and Delivered receipts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tapback replies with any emoji</li>\n\n\n\n<li>High-quality photos and videos</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Large file sharing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Audio messages</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The new features also extend to group chats, which no longer bring the whole conversation back to SMS levels. Now conversations with a mix of Android and iPhone users will be ‚Äúmore reliable,‚Äù according to Apple, but users will only notice that basic iMessage features will no longer be unavailable.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Never thought I‚Äôd see the day.. <br /><br />RCS on iPhone is now active with iOS 18 Beta 2! üéâ <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://t.co/522cmzRdPH&amp;xcust=1-1-2378180-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/522cmzRdPH</a></p>‚Äî Brandon Butch (@BrandonButch) <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://twitter.com/BrandonButch/status/1805712679404806603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2378180-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">June 25, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Android users still won‚Äôt have access to exclusive iMessage features, including editing and deleting messages, stickers, and message effects. Messages also won‚Äôt be end-to-end encrypted at launch, though Apple says it is working with the GSM Association ‚Äúto evolve RCS and make messaging more equitable and secure.‚Äù</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2f55f0c220241a431bf24cae5476f23054e50bbb4aad2569d2b171ea3e776fd5","category":"Apple"}
