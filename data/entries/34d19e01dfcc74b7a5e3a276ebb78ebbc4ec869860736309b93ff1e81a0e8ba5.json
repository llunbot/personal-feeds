{"title":"Testing the New Ultrawide Mac Virtual Display Option in VisionOS 2.2","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/vision-pro-ultrawide-display/","date":1731374785000,"content":"\n<p>MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With the wide display option, there’s enough screen real estate to\nuse four apps at once without compromising on window size.\nUltrawide bumps up the available space even more, and it’s almost\ntoo much display space.</p>\n\n<p>Using the ultrawide setting is like having multiple curved Mac\ndisplays in front of you to handle your Mac apps, and then you can\nalso add in visionOS apps to better utilize the virtual space\naround you. The larger screen sizes for the Mac do improve\nproductivity because there’s so much more space to work with.</p>\n\n<p>Note that you still can’t use multiple Mac windows when mirroring\nyour Mac display to your Vision Pro, but the wide and ultrawide\nprovide so much space that it’s essentially the same function.\nApple says that the ultrawide mode is equivalent to using two 4K\nmonitors side by side.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If this suits your physical workspace (like, say, if you live and work in a studio apartment) or travel needs, it comes close to justifying the cost of a Vision Pro by itself. A single Studio Display costs $1,600 (without a nicer stand, without the nicer nano-texture coating).</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/11/mac-virtual-display-ultrawide\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"34d19e01dfcc74b7a5e3a276ebb78ebbc4ec869860736309b93ff1e81a0e8ba5","category":"Tech"}
