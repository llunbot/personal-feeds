We have investigated every rumor and trend we could find to bring you our predictions. Read on to find out what could be in store.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Apple has released in 2023, so far</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple hit the ground running in 2023 with new Macs and a new HomePod in January. Then at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/wwdc\">WWDC</a> in June the company launched no less than three new Macs and a brand new device – the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">Vision Pro</a> – alongside revealing its plans for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS 14 Sonoma</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1792869/watchos-10-release-date-new-features.html\">watchOS 10</a>. Finally (maybe) Apple launched the new iPhone 15 series and the Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/no-new-ipad-air-mini-pro-2023.html\">event</a> in September and then made macOS Sonoma and iOS 17 available for customers to download later that month. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347466/mac-mini-design-processsor-price-release.html\">M2 Mac mini</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678527/mac-mini-pro.html\">Mac mini with M2 Pro</a> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/821143/2023-macbook-pro-m2-pro-max-release-price-specs.html\">14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> with M2 Pro chip</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1509062/homepod-2023-review.html\">full size HomePod</a> (bit of a surprise this one!) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>A larger <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819516/15-inch-macbook-air-release-date-specs-rumors.html\">15-inch MacBook Air</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>A new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347010/new-mac-pro-2023.html\">Mac Pro with the M2 Ultra</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484944/mac-studio-m2-m3-max-ultra-release-date-price-specs.html\">new Mac Studio</a>, also with M2 Ultra and M2 Max.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-max-specs-release-price.html\">iPhone 15</a>, Plus, Pro and Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1472709/apple-watch-series-9-rumors-specs-features-price-release.html\">2023 Apple Watch Series 9 And Ultra 2</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>And of course the brand-new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">Vision Pro</a> headset (which will arrive in 2024)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What new Apple products are coming in 2023?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the sections below we’ve split products into categories including Mac, iPad, iPhone and some new product categories. Read on to find out what to expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also like to read about what we expect in terms of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/apples-next-event.html\">Apple’s Events in 2023.</a> </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"New Apple Products Apple Event September\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1246w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1200%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1240%2C868&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"836\" /><figcaption>The products Apple announced at the September 2022 event.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Macs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the update for the Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2023 Apple has finally finished transitioning all its Macs from Intel processors to its own silicon. There are still some Macs in need of a second-generation Apple silicon update, though. Here’s what we’re still expecting to arrive: </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iMac with M3</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope that a new iMac is coming soon. The iMac is still running an M1 chip while the rest of the lineup is now on the second generation of Apple’s Mac chips, and it’s well overdue an update. But will Apple skip the M2 and move straight to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484743/24-inch-imac-release-date-specs-m2-m3-processor-price.html\">M3 for the iMac</a>? That’s the rumor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also hope to get a Pro version of the iMac, a return of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">27-inch iMac Pro</a> perhaps. It sounds like an M3 Pro iMac might happen, but we could be waiting a little longer for that one.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Fall 2023</em> or spring 2024</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MacBook Air with M3 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a rumor that Apple will update the 13-inch MacBook Air with an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2030760/m3-lineup-cpu-cpu-memory-macbook-imac-mac-mini.html\">M3</a> before it does the same to the 15-inch model, which is preposterous. We expect that both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air will get a new chip, but we don’t think it will be until spring 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2000691/13-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-release-date-specs-rumors-html.html\">M3 MacBook Air rumors</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>13-inch MacBook Pro with M3 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be strange if Apple didn’t update the 13-inch MacBook Pro at the same time as the Air… </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPads</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://bilder.macwelt.de/4315300_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPad Pro\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>The iPad Pro</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There was one iPad that wasn’t updated in 2022, so that looks the most likely for an update in 2023. But there’s also a rumor that a larger iPad Pro could be coming. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPad mini </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A new iPad mini–seventh generation–could be coming in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/new-ipad-mini-7-2022-release-date-price-specs.html\">iPad mini 7 rumors</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Fall 2023</em> or spring 2024</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bigger iPad Pro </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There could be a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/14-inch-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">14-inch iPad Pro</a> coming from Apple before the end of 2023, but we think we may be waiting until 2024 for this one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPhones </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The arrival of a new set of iPhones isn’t likely to happen before September 2024, although there is a small chance we could see a new iPhone SE before then. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 14 camera\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 16 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 16 is likely to arrive, like clockwork, in September 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16 rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? September 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone SE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a long shot, but a few years ago now there were rumors that Apple could launch a bigger version of the iPhone SE Plus – which would mean that those who want a big iPhone and a Home button would still have an option. It’s a nice idea but we aren’t convinced this is in Apple’s sights now. Read about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674037/iphone-se-plus-postponed-until-2021.html\">iPhone SE Plus</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, we can’t be sure there is a future for the iPhone SE at all. Apparently, an update is “unlikely” to come before 2025. If it arrives in a larger screen size and has no home button the people who are drawn to this iPhone will no doubt be disappointed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE rumors</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New AirPods </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Max are desperately in need of an update – being unable to play lossless audio right now, will they get an update in 2023? Unfortunately, there aren’t any noisy rumors about them right now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are rumors about AirPods Lite, which are said to be $99 AirPods. Will these launch before then end of 2023? Again, it’s uncertain.. We may be waiting until 2024.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">New AirPods rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Fall 2023 or spring 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Apple Watch </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect that Apple will launch an Apple Watch Series 10 and a third-generation Apple Watch Ultra in September 2024. Both will feature a new S10 chip. A third-gen Apple Watch SE is also possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Fall 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New product categories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple was never to innovate away from the products it makes right now it could be left behind as technology progresses. It’s no surprise therefore that the company is working on various new areas. We don’t expect these to land in 2023, but rumors suggest that some of them still could arrive sooner rather than later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vision Pro headset </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We know it’s a real thing because Apple showed off the Vision Pro mixed reality headset at WWDC in June 2023, but we are less sure when it will launch. Apple said “Early 2024”, but Apple doesn’t always meet its self-imposed deadlines.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\">Apple’s Vision Pro</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HomePod with screen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We do hope there is some truth in the rumors that Apple is working on a HomePod with a screen. We’ve always said that a screen would make the HomePod infinitely more usable, but perhaps we are the only ones who hate having to talk to our speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A screen would extend the uses of the HomePod beyond audio into visual – so you could watch podcasts and news reports and YouTube videos, but most usefully communicate via FaceTime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far all Apple has done is brought back the full-size HomePod that it removed from sale. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with screen rumours</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When?

This is a rumor that has been going for years–it’s in the same territory as the long-rumored Apple television. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for whether the ‘Apple Car’ is a car or car software nobody is sure, but Apple has definitely had a team working on the project over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670232/apple-car-release-date-design-price-rumours.html\">Apple Car rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When?
