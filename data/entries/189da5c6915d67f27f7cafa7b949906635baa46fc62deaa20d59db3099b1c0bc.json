Scanning its main Today tab in the morning has become my modern-day equivalent of scanning the front page of a printed newspaper — a way to get a sense of what’s going on in world news. There’s a level of editorial curation and presentation in Apple News that I don’t think has a peer. Apple News itself doesn’t publish or report anything, but there’s clearly a talented, level-headed editorial team that is picking and choosing the most important and most interesting (which are often very different things) stories from a wide variety of sources. So maybe a better analogy to the bygone era of print isn’t scanning the front page of <em>a</em>  newspaper, but rather stopping at a good big-city newsstand where you could scan the front pages of a slew of newspapers from around the country (and world).</p>\n\n<p>I don’t look to Apple News for anything related to tech. I definitely want to do that via RSS (which for me means <a href=\"https://netnewswire.com/\">NetNewsWire</a>), the web (Safari), and social media. But for national, world, and general interest news, Apple News is really good. I don’t know what it’s like without a News+ subscription, but with one, it’s truly excellent. And a News+ subscription gets you access to a bunch of great publications with paywalls on the web.</p>\n\n<p>If you cemented your opinion of Apple News years ago and tuned out, you should give it a fresh look — especially if you have a “free” News+ subscription via Apple One.</p>\n\n<p>But, my god, the ads suck — low-rent and highly repetitive. <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/C9n9qP4Ryex\">I posted screen recordings over the summer</a> illustrating this. It seems like recently, though, I’ve seen fewer ads, and they’ve gotten less repetitive. I just spent a few minutes now perusing the Today tab while writing this post, and I read a bunch of articles without seeing any ads at all. For me at least, the Apple News ad experience seems to be getting better already. But there’s still so much room for improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever I write about this, some readers will comment that, to their minds, a paid subscription like Apple News+ should bestow a completely ad-free experience. That’s how streaming video and music subscriptions tend to work, but even there — <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/20/iger-disney-plus-ad-supported\">as I just posted regarding Disney+</a> — many people are choosing lower-priced streaming subscriptions subsidized by ads. The economics for ad-free news just don’t work, and never have. News+ isn’t like TV+, where Apple owns or has paid for the rights to all of the content.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/20/apple-selling-apple-news-ads\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"189da5c6915d67f27f7cafa7b949906635baa46fc62deaa20d59db3099b1c0bc","category":"Tech"}
