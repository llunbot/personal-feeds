Devinci Cycles’ updated Hatchet lineup is just as versatile, with high-performance carbon models, budget-friendly aluminum framed options, and even a pedal-assisted E-Hatchet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Hatchet lineup is comprised of three models– The Hatchet PRO, Hatchet Vista, and the E-Hatchet Tour. Devinci is offering three builds for the PRO model, two for the Vista model, and just one for the E-Hatchet Tour. Check out the details and specs on the whole lineup below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Devinci Hatchet PRO:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-frame-closeup.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-frame-closeup.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Hatchet PRO, frame, close\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-frame-closeup.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-frame-closeup-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-frame-closeup-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-frame-closeup-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-frame-closeup-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-frame-closeup-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Hatchet PRO boasts a completely redesigned carbon OSC (Optimal Strength Carbon) frame. All three Hatchet PRO builds come with a full carbon OSC fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The revised frame features a more aerodynamic shape and is significantly stiffer than the previous version. Devinci also uses size-specific carbon layups to ensure that all frame sizes wind up with consistent stiffness levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devinci has tuned the frame’s stiffness by employing a unique layup of high-strength and high-modulus carbon fibers. The lower part of the Hatchet PRO’s frame is strengthened to ensure efficient power transfer and optimal lateral stiffness. The upper half is kept leaner, providing compliance and ride comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-Shed-storage.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-Shed-storage.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Hatchet PRO, Shed frame storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-Shed-storage.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-Shed-storage-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-Shed-storage-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-Shed-storage-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-Shed-storage-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-Shed-storage-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As in-frame storage is quickly gaining popularity beyond MTBs, Devinci has included their Shed storage system in the Hatchet PRO’s downtube. A zippered tool bag is included with each bike. For hydration, all frame sizes offer ample room for two water bottles.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping things looking slick, Devinci went with thru-headset internal cable routing. The Hatchet PROs run Acros IPS (Internal Protection Sealing) headsets, designed to keep the bearings clean and dry.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-UDH-derailleur.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-UDH-derailleur.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Hatchet PRO, UDH\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-UDH-derailleur.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-UDH-derailleur-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-UDH-derailleur-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-UDH-derailleur-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-UDH-derailleur-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-UDH-derailleur-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hatchet PRO frame has an integrated seat clamp, and it accepts 27.2mm seat posts… including dropper posts! The frame uses a UDH derailleur hanger, and is compatible with SRAM Full Mount derailleurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom bracket is a 386 EVO press-fit type, and the Hatchet PRO frame has enough clearance for 700x45mm tires. The top tube includes a bento box mount for frame bags.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-front-derailleur.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-front-derailleur.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Hatchet PRO, front derailleur\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-front-derailleur.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-front-derailleur-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-front-derailleur-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-front-derailleur-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-front-derailleur-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-Hatchet-PRO-front-derailleur-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hatchet PRO also comes with a cover for the front derailleur mount.

The frame features hydro-formed, triple-reinforced tubing to offer light weight, durability, comfort, and efficient power transfer.

Whether to take you further or make you faster, the E-Hatchet Tour offers what Devinci calls ‘the right amount of electric assistance’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The E-Hatchet Tour is built on an Optimum R03 6061-T6 aluminum frame, which features triple-reinforced, hydroformed tubing like the Vista models above. Up front is a full-carbon OSC fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame provides internal cable routing (not through the headset), has clearance for 700x45mm tires, and employs a T47 threaded bottom bracket. This model can accommodate a dropper post but does not have UDH-compatible dropouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-w-bottles.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-w-bottles.webp\" alt=\"Devinci E-Hatchet Tour, w bottles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-w-bottles.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-w-bottles-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-w-bottles-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-w-bottles-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-w-bottles-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-w-bottles-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are four accessory mounts on the E-Hatchet frame, and two more on the fork that allow for side cage compatibility.

Power is supplied by a Mahle iX2 237Wh battery neatly hidden in the downtube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the stock battery alone, the bike’s listed range is up to 90km (56 miles). However, if that’s not enough you can add Mahle’s eX1 range extender, which offers an extra 171Wh of capacity and approximately 55km (34 miles) more range.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-button-app.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-button-app.webp\" alt=\"Devinci E-Hatchet Tour, button and app\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-button-app.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-button-app-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-button-app-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-button-app-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-button-app-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Devinci-E-Hatchet-Tour-button-app-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the E-Hatchet’s top tube, you’ll find Mahle’s HMI control button.
