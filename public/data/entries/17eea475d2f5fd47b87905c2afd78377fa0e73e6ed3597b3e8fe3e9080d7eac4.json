Young has a very good track record with display-related information about future Apple products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/macbook-air-spacegray-purple.jpg\" alt width=\"1428\" height=\"802\" />\r<br />\nLast month, Young said Apple's supply chain had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/13/15-inch-macbook-air-display-production/\">started production of display panels</a> for a new 15-inch MacBook Air, which would be the largest display size ever offered for the laptop. At the time, Young said he expected this MacBook Air to be released in early April, and he reiterated that timeframe in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1632772048895496192\">brief tweet</a> today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf the 15-inch MacBook Air launches in April, there is still a chance of an announcement and pre-orders being sooner. Apple often announces new products in March, but it did hold an April event in 2021, so both months are possibilities. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe existing 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip launched in July 2022 after being announced at WWDC a month earlier. It's still not entirely clear if the 15-inch model would be equipped with the M2 chip or the M3 chip, as rumors have conflicted. Last year, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/15/kuo-15-inch-m2-macbook-2023-rumor/\">15-inch MacBook with M2 and M2 Pro chip options</a> would be released in the second quarter of 2023, potentially without Air branding.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has normally reserved larger display sizes for the MacBook Pro, so a 15-inch MacBook Air could provide customers with more screen real estate at a lower price point. The laptop would also have a larger chassis, allowing for a bigger battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects both 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/05/new-macbook-airs-by-summer-gurman/\">to launch between late spring and summer</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/15-inch-macbook-air/\">15-Inch MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/15-inch-macbook-air-april-ross-young/\">15-Inch MacBook Air Still on Track to Launch in April, Says Analyst</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/15-inch-macbook-air-still-on-track-to-launch-in-april-says-analyst.2382962/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"17eea475d2f5fd47b87905c2afd78377fa0e73e6ed3597b3e8fe3e9080d7eac4","category":"Apple"}
