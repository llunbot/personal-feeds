The Galaxy S25 Edge appears to be aimed at the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> Air, a rumored ultra thin <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> that's set to debut this September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/samsung-galaxy-s25.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1067\" height=\"600\" /><em><div>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge will be thinner than the S25 pictured here</div></em>\r<br />\nSamsung only teased the Galaxy S25 Edge, but the device is set to launch in the first half of 2025. With a debut date before September, Samsung will beat Apple and will be able to launch a super thin smartphone first. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/samsung-galaxy-edge.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2396\" height=\"1348\" /><em><div>The Samsung Galaxy Edge is on the right in this comparison photo</div></em>\r<br />\nLittle information is available on the Galaxy S25 Edge, but it appears to be a thinner variation of the Galaxy S25. Samsung plans to price it below the $1300 S25 Ultra, suggesting it will be a middle-tier device with lower specs due to thinness, which is exactly what we're expecting from the ‌iPhone 17‌ Air.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFI6aEWyXvE/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFI6aEWyXvE/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by MacRumors (@macrumors)</a></p></div></blockquote></div>\r<br />\nRumors suggest that Apple's upcoming super thin ‌iPhone‌ will have a 6.6-inch display and a chassis that's somewhere between 5.5mm and 6mm, making it the thinnest ‌iPhone‌ to date. It will have lower battery capacity and a single-lens rear camera due to space constraints, but it will mark Apple's first major ‌iPhone‌ redesign in several years. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge/\">Samsung Working on Super Thin 'Galaxy S25 Edge' to Compete With iPhone 17 Air</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-working-on-super-thin-galaxy-s25-edge-to-compete-with-iphone-17-air.2447909/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ea247dbb37ec4bf128f98ccbf7135e50cd29c31b067e909c2529bdde64064ae1","category":"Apple"}
