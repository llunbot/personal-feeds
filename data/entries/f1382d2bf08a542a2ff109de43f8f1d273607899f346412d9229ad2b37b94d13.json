Aaaand gosh, was it a let down. The feature — which you\ncould call “Portrait mode for video” — adds artistic blur\naround the object in focus. The coolest thing is that you can\ntap to refocus while you shoot (and even do it afterward in the\nPhotos app).</p>\n\n<p>Except, as you can see in my video, the software struggles to know\nwhere objects begin and end. It’s a lot like the early days of\nPortrait Mode, but it’s worse because now the blur moves and\nwarps. I shot footage where the software lost parts of noses and\nfingers, and struggled with items such as a phone or camera. The\nApple spokeswoman said Cinematic mode is a “breakthrough\ninnovation that will keep getting better over time.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Stern went all-in on Cinematic mode for the video accompanying her review.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/21/stern-iphone-13-cinematic-mode\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f1382d2bf08a542a2ff109de43f8f1d273607899f346412d9229ad2b37b94d13","category":"Tech"}
