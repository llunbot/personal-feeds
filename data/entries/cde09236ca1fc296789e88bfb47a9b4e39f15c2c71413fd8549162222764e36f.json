There are eight colors to choose from, and the line below the tab can be customized to be between 1 and 7 pixels wide. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/active-tabs.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://andadinosaur.com/launch-activetab-for-safari\">As Zhenyi notes</a>, the extension works best with the \"Separate\" tab layout selected and \"Show color in tab bar\" disabled in the Tab section of Safari's Preferences. Zhenyi also cautions that ActiveTab will not work reliably if you have so many tabs in a window that the tab bar becomes scrollable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/activetab/id1588852241?mt=12\">ActiveTab</a> is available for $1.99 on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/\">Mac App Store</a>, with no in-app purchases, no ads, and no tracking.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(H/T <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/activetab-a-simple-extension-to-tell-which-safari-15-tab-is-active/\">MacStories</a>.)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/\">Safari</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/06/safari-15-extension-mac-helps-tell-tab-active/\">Safari 15 Extension for Mac Helps You Tell Which Tab Is Active</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/safari-15-extension-for-mac-helps-you-tell-which-tab-is-active.2315622/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KDp14AidltA:5aeg2LZXT7w:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KDp14AidltA:5aeg2LZXT7w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/KDp14AidltA\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cde09236ca1fc296789e88bfb47a9b4e39f15c2c71413fd8549162222764e36f","category":"Apple"}
