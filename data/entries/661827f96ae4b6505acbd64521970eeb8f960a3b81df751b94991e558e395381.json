The event is expected to be the unveiling of the next generation the iPhone and Apple Watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Invites to view the event contain the tagline “Wonderlust” and feature an Apple logo that appears to be composed of a sand-like substance, with parts of it being swept away in a breeze. The logo’s composition will surely breed speculation as to what Apple has in store for the event—which we’ll save for a later date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we do know is that the event will almost certainly showcase the iPhone 15 lineup, which is expected to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2043520/usb-c-iphone-15-faq-cable-speeds-port-thunderbolt.html\">switch from Lightning to USB-C</a> and deliver several <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1487037/iphone-15-pro-max-ultra-design-display-camera-price-rumors.html\">iPhone 15 Pro and Pro max updates</a>, including a new titanium frame and a periscope zoom lens for enhanced zoom. Apple is also expected to release the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1472709/apple-watch-series-9-rumors-specs-features-price-release.html\">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and may launch a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">new iPad mini</a> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will make the event available to watch on the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2045866-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/\">Apple website</a>, on the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/@Apple&amp;xcust=1-1-2045866-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple YouTube channel</a>, and in the Apple TV app. If you are unable to watch the event live, it will be available through those venues for viewing at a later time.</p>\n\nApple Inc, Apple Watch, iPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"661827f96ae4b6505acbd64521970eeb8f960a3b81df751b94991e558e395381","category":"Apple"}
