It features a different design for angled-in hoods, different flare, narrower sizes, and even more integrated cable routing. ENVE teased us earlier this year that we could ride the same cockpit as Tadej Pogačar, but now we finally can, as long as our pocketbooks can handle it…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ENVE SES Aero Pro $1200 1-piece carbon road cockpit</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-piece-enve-handlebar-stem-pogacar-tour-de-france-2023-c.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-piece-enve-handlebar-stem-pogacar-tour-de-france-2023-c.jpg\" alt=\"ENVE one-piece SES aero handlebar-stem cockpit for Tadej Pogacar in tour de france 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-piece-enve-handlebar-stem-pogacar-tour-de-france-2023-c.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-piece-enve-handlebar-stem-pogacar-tour-de-france-2023-c-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-piece-enve-handlebar-stem-pogacar-tour-de-france-2023-c-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-piece-enve-handlebar-stem-pogacar-tour-de-france-2023-c-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-piece-enve-handlebar-stem-pogacar-tour-de-france-2023-c-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-piece-enve-handlebar-stem-pogacar-tour-de-france-2023-c-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(All photos/ENVE)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When ENVE launched the $1200 <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/enve-ses-ar-inroute-one-piece-bar-stem/\" target=\"_blank\">AR bar</a> back in January, they suggested that was the bar they developed for Pogačar.

If you spend so many hours in the saddle like I do, then any contact point with the bike is key and little details make a big difference. I must say I’m really happy with what ENVE have produced for us both with their wheels and handlebars.

Compare it to the compound bend flare of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/enve-ses-ar-inroute-one-piece-bar-stem/\" target=\"_blank\">AR</a>. The flare here is also a bit less, so the drops are 3cm wider than the hoods (vs. 5cm wider on the AR).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_US-made-in-Ogden-Utah-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_US-made-in-Ogden-Utah-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ENVE SES Aero Pro bar 1200-dollar 1-piece carbon road bike cockpit, US-made in OgdenUT\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_US-made-in-Ogden-Utah-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_US-made-in-Ogden-Utah-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_US-made-in-Ogden-Utah-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_US-made-in-Ogden-Utah-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_US-made-in-Ogden-Utah-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_US-made-in-Ogden-Utah-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_US-made-in-Ogden-Utah-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ENVE also manufactures this new SES Aero Pro bar as a 1-piece carbon monocoque construction, unlike the more modular AR bar. It also gets a smoother top that favors less bar tape – carefully wrapped from the first bend in the tops of the bar for the cleanest look. And so it also features fully enclosed internal cable routing inside the bar to keep your cables out of the wind, unlike the more accessible cable channels on the AR bar that would most often end up under bar tape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_side-compact-bend-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_side-compact-bend-jpg.webp\" alt=\"ENVE SES Aero Pro bar 1200-dollar 1-piece carbon road bike cockpit, compact bend\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_side-compact-bend-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_side-compact-bend-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_side-compact-bend-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_side-compact-bend-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ENVE-SES-Aero-Pro-bar-1200-dollar-1-piece-carbon-road-bike-cockpit_side-compact-bend-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>handmade 1-piece monocoque carbon road bike bar + stem cockpit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>compact curve with 129mm drop &amp;
