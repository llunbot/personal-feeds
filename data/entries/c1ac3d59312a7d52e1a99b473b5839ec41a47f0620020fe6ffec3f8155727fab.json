We couldn't tell them apart. To this day, it will always be ‘Adam red bike’ and ‘Simon blue bike’ to me, that’s what I've called them since they rode Manchester regional track league when they were only 15 or 16.”</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>Carole Leigh's name might not be one you’ve heard of, but she’s been an integral part of the careers of some of the best riders that Great Britain has ever produced. Adam and Simon Yates are just two in a long list of professional cyclists who have spent their formative years racing at events organised by Leigh, who has been working as a volunteer putting on bike races since she was 18 years old.</span></p>\n<p><span>“Other people my age wanted to go to the pub and I wanted to organise a bike race,” Leigh laughs. “It was a circuit race in Wigan. Since the inception of the National Cycling Centre which opened 30 years ago, we started organising the Manchester regional track league and I still do that today, 30 years later. It’s not just me, we have a whole team of people and I’ve had so many roles over the years and been blessed to work with some lovely people on many different events, both on the admin and officiating side.\"</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Image_Carole_Leigh_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1732281330\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p><span> <em>Leigh at the Leicester National Track Championships in 1982 (Image: Phil O'Connor)</em></span></p>\n<p><span>Leigh explains that she followed in the footsteps of her father who was also a race organiser – she and her brother used to work as runners growing up when<span> data was recorded by typewriters on to cards for every rider for each event they rode. </span>Leigh notes how much the sport has changed since then – she has also been part of the team at events which have aimed to take a more modern approach to track cycling, such as the Revolution Series.</span></p>\n<p><span>“So we started that off and continued right through to the end,” Leigh remembers. “But I think officiating at the 2012 Olympics must be the highlight of my time in the sport. The Olympics is a pinnacle in anyone's career, be it on the bike or off the bike. But I do what I do because I love the sport. I have made so many friends and colleagues over the many years and friendships when you work together, it's like a second family.”</span></p>\n<p><span>As cycling has developed, Leigh notes that she has seen fewer people getting involved as volunteers which she rightly states could be detrimental to the progress of the riders coming through the British Cycling system. Grassroots and domestic racing is the lifeblood of the sport, and people like Leigh make it possible for this to continue.</span></p>\n<p><span>“There's a dwindling band of volunteers and we are the backbone of the sport. I don't think there's an easy fix, but I would say just get involved. Get down at your local velodrome, outdoor or indoor, your road circuit, or just contact your local region and see what input you can give. We're happy to take anybody and nurture them through,” Leigh says. “You can get friendships out of it and feel part of a team that is making a difference.”</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Image-Carole-Leigh-4_1024x1024.jpg?v=1732281538\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p><em><span>Leigh alongside Mark Cavendish at the Tour of Britain </span></em></p>\n<p><span>While Leigh is keen to state that she doesn’t want thanks or praise for her commitment to the sport, she comments that it was an honour to be inducted into the <a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/about/article/20241024-13-NEW-INDUCTEES-INTO-THE-BRITISH-CYCLING-HALL-OF-FAME-0\" target=\"_blank\">British Cycling Hall of Fame</a> this year as recognition for her contribution. </span></p>\n<p><span>“Sometimes I think volunteers can be a bit taken for granted and perhaps people don’t appreciate the knowledge and the responsibility that it actually takes,” Leigh says. “We don’t do it for a reward, we do it for enjoyment and that is the reward, but it’s nice to get that respect. For me, it's a true honour and privilege to be inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame. It's been a long journey, but to have that recognition, I am quite humbled.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Leigh is undoubtedly deserving of praise and admiration for her selfless commitment to the sport – her free time outside of her full-time job has been spent at countless bike races, creating opportunities for cyclists, young and old. There needs to be the next generation of volunteers like Leigh in order for bike races to survive, however. The British woman explains that her wish is not for personal accolades or awards, but for more people to get involved in volunteering to help drive cycling in the UK forwards.</span></p>\n<p><span>“Just with a little bit of encouragement, we can try and bring people through the ranks. I enjoy nurturing and being a mentor for young volunteers and young officials coming through,” Leigh says. “Hopefully they will get the enjoyment I’ve had through serving the sport.”</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Cover image by Gary Main</span></em></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"c1ac3d59312a7d52e1a99b473b5839ec41a47f0620020fe6ffec3f8155727fab","category":"Cycling"}
