Apple’s earbuds have been steadily dropping in price all week and nearly every model is at an all-time-low heading into the biggest sales day of the year. Here’s what’s Amazon is selling:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods (2nd Generation): $109</a> ($20 off)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods (3rd Generation): $150</a> ($30 off)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods Pro: $159</a> ($90 off)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZHYWJS/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods Max: $429</a> ($120 off)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We apologize in advance if any of the above models are out of stock. Product availability has been fluctuating on a daily, even hourly basis, so if something’s gone, be sure to check back throughout the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably don’t need to be reminded why AirPods are so great, but if you do, here are our reviews for the newest <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/549094/airpods-3rd-generation-review.html\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233522/airpods-pro-review.html\">AirPods Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">AirPods Max</a>. Apple’s earbuds are often on sale, but these prices represent the lowest we’ve seen and we don’t expect them to go much lower between now and Christmas. So if you want a pair, go get em while you still can.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"36d13e25b8bc0a2b2ea9dcc8a025cef41e3e47b371b6011c6bd7ae9e511f17e1","category":"Apple"}
