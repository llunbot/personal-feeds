Luckily, BikeRadar has done the heavy lifting for you and put together the very best mountain bikes under £2,000 (that’s around $2,500) in 2023.</p>\n<p>Between £1,000 and £2,000 is the point that <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/\">full-suspension mountain bikes</a> begin to make more sense, with decent builds that have few compromises.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to buy a hardtail in this price range, you’ll also have a hard time buying a bad one. This price bracket is a popular one for enthusiast cyclists, which has made for an incredibly competitive market, forcing brands to spec bikes with increasingly high-quality builds, including more expensive <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">mountain bike groupsets</a>.</p>\n<h2>The best mountain bikes under £2,000 / $2,500, as rated by our expert testers</h2>\n<h3>Boardman MTR 8.9</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Angled pack shot of the Boardman MTR 8.9 full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Boardman MTR 8.9 - 03\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Boardman MTR 8.9 has the same geometry as the MTR 9.0.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd  / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£1,750 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Rapid acceleration; supportive suspension</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Extreme riding exposes the bike’s limits</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Boardman MTR 8.9 is the less expensive version of the MTR 9.0. It has the same alloy frame, geometry and suspension as its pricier sibling but with a more affordable <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-nx-eagle-review/\">SRAM NX Eagle</a> drivetrain.</p>\n<p>The bike is comfortable and has a relaxed riding position. However, the seat-tube angle does feel too relaxed when climbing steep gradients.</p>\n<p>The rear suspension doesn’t bob too much under pedalling, rewarding your input with quick acceleration. It still has enough give, absorbing small bumps. The RockShox 35 Gold RL front fork also does a good job at absorbing bumps, even on steep climbs.</p>\n<p>Despite only having an 11-50t cassette and 32t front chainring, the bike doesn’t feel lacking in gears, thanks to its low weight and snappy suspension.</p>\n<p>The inclusion of a dropper post enhances the bike’s ride and improves flow on trail centre loops, for which it is well-suited.</p>\n<p>On descents, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-introduces-new-guide-t-disc-brakes/\">SRAM Guide T</a> brakes can feel wooden and the bike is a little noisy. But despite these issues, the MTR 8.9 is a fun bike to ride. It’s ripe for upgrades and we’d choose to turn it into a light and fast mile-munching machine.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/boardman-mtr-8-9-review/\">Read our full Boardman MTR 8.9 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Canyon Neuron 5</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/mountain-bikes/trail-bikes/neuron/al/neuron-5/3165.html\">Buy direct from Canyon</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Neuron 5 full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Canyon Neuron 5 - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Canyon has hit the nail on the head for a rapid and composed-feeling trail bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£1,849 / $2,099 / €1,899 / AU$2,949 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Carries speed well on flatter trails; good composure; enough grip in most conditions</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Lacks support on steeper terrain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Canyon’s Neuron 5 is fast-rolling on mellow trails, while remaining comfortable on rougher terrain thanks to supple suspension characteristics.

Trail 500’s geometry is relatively short.

Trail 500 is a comfortable climber. The longer reach in testing meant there was plenty of room to move around and the steep seat tube improved comfort, made pedalling easier and reduced front wheel lift.</p>\n<p>When it comes to descents, the Recon fork has plenty of mid-stroke and low-speed compression helping you go fast and amplifying the aluminium frame’s calm feel.</p>\n<p>The mix of Merida’s own-brand kit, including a dropper post, and branded kit from Shimano keeps the bike’s price down but this doesn’t stop it from being one of the most capable bikes for under £2,000.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/merida-big-trail-500-review/\">Read our full Merida Big.

There are small niggles – like that dropper lever – but none that would cost much to change.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/boardman-mtr-9-0-review/?image=3&amp;type=gallery&amp;gallery=1&amp;embedded_slideshow=1\">Read our full Boardman MTR 9.0 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>GT Zaskar LT Elite</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the GT Zaskar LT Elite hardtail mountain bike\" title=\"GT Zaskar LT Elite - 02\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Zaskar offers a modern ride with a similar silhouette to its 1990s equivalent.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£1,350 / $1,700 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Suntour Zeron fork works well; good grip in most conditions</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Noisy on rough descents</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The GT Zaskar was the go-to hardtail for aggressive riding in the 1990s and this new version has the same silhouette as its ’90s counterpart.</p>\n<p>However, the new Zaskar comes with bigger wheels than its predecessor, a stretched-out frame and a relaxed head angle, creating a bang-up-to-date ride feel and smooth handling.</p>\n<p>As a result, the Zaskar is extremely fun to ride and it ticks off hard trails and steep sections with confidence.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/mountain-bike-tyres/wtb-trail-boss-tough-fast-rolling-tt-2-6in-rear-tyre-review/\">WTB Trail Boss tyres</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/sr-suntour/\">SR Suntour</a> fork help with its downhill performance and the inclusion of a dropper post enables you to take on tricky trails.</p>\n<p>The Zaskar would have scored higher if it wasn’t for a couple of minor gripes.
