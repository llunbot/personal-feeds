After pulling one almighty turn for Pogačar at last weekend’s <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-of-flanders-all-the-essential-info-for-the-flemish-monument?srsltid=AfmBOorzVJVCYkVibF7MT90dZ3D6BXMuJMM8XL08gsn8AXPLCg4IGpS0\">Tour of Flanders</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/everything-is-perfect-if-you-re-tadej-pogacar\">Slovenian winner</a> signalled António Morgado out in his post-race press conference. “The young boy Morgado is impressive,” he said. “He’s going to be a big champion – he is already.” Game recognises game and all that.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Aged just 21 and only competing in his second WorldTour season, as well as being a race winner of five races himself, Morgado is growing into one of UAE Team Emirates-XRG’s most trusted domestiques, and this weekend he will be one of six riders aiming to deliver Pogačar to a historic <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/paris-roubaix-men-2025-preview-can-pogacar-win-the-hell-of-the-north-on-debut?srsltid=AfmBOopsaMi8NuNxMUGKvvvJTCCW0v7GSQ5wjbFgHYPGRoJSG7yaVOw7\">Paris-Roubaix </a>win on debut. Hearing Pogačar’s praise brings a smile to Morgado’s face. “It’s pleasing for me because it comes from the best ever,” the Portuguese told </span><em>Rouleur</em><span>. “It’s a big motivation to keep working more and more.”</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Morgado has adapted to the rigours of pro racing with aplomb, finishing fifth at his maiden Tour of Flanders last year, and winning four hilly one-day races. It’s clear where his talent lies. “Of course I expected this [his development to be so quick] because I work for this. In these types of Classics I feel I can show my potential. Flanders suits me more and during the last two months I’ve felt good. With my power and mental strength, I’ve been doing well.”</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Shepherding Pogačar on the 30 sectors of Roubaix cobbles will be his most important – and difficult – task this spring, but Morgado has no doubt the three-time Tour de France champion will be in contention for the win. “I think Tadej will do well because we never see him do bad,” he said. “I don’t think it’s going to be any different. When Tadej is racing, you don’t try to wait for him because when he goes it’s hard to follow and hard to counterattack.</span></p>\n<p><span>From there, it’s likely to be a battle between UAE, <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/we-are-in-the-pogacar-van-der-poel-era-but-who-is-more-likely-to-win-all-five-monuments?srsltid=AfmBOop2HotE2zix6mZgcPiaRZJS-NbYDBPtW6Fm6udrKUxSWdsAlB_X\">Mathieu van der Poel’s</a> Alpecin-Deceuninck, Mads Pedersen’s Lidl-Trek and Wout van Aert’s Visma-Lease a Bike. “I expect a big fight between those teams, a lot of players with different tactics. I hope our team can manage things well and try to keep the race hard,\" Morgado said. \"My job is to help put him and the other guys at the front of the first sectors. We need to have a good position on all the sectors otherwise you’re out of the race. The first one is super important and then the one before the Arenberg is as well.”</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Of course, UAE don’t only have Pogačar as a potential winner: Nils Politt and Florian Vermeersch have been finished second in the race, while Tim Wellens and Mikkel Bjerg have the skillsets to podium as well. “I think we have many talents in this team to win the race,” Morgado said. “We have two riders who’ve already been on the podium so we have many cards as well as Tadej. It’s going to be a good race.”</span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>Should Pogačar do the remarkable and win, Morgado, the rider tipped for greatness himself, would have played his role. “If any of us win, there’s going to be a big party,” he smiled.</span></p>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"eed85891ff21491953ef0f0043159965ee21819546cb0cc7106673a7ba7326f9","category":"Cycling"}
