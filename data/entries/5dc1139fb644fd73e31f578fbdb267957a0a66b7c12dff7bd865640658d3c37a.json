The news comes amid a speculative boom in the price of all sorts of <em>CS:GO</em> items, following the news that those skins will be fully compatible with the recently announced <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>.</p>\n<p>Danish trader <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/id/zipel\">zipeL</a>, who helps manage <em>CS:Go</em> market clearinghouse <a href=\"http://www.skinbid.com\">SkinBid</a>, shared news of a $500,000+ transaction <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zipelCS/status/1647581584738885638\">on Twitter earlier this week</a>. While that transaction also included a rare (but \"well-worn\") Karambit #387 P1 knife, the highlight was a \"#1 AK-47 661 ST MW with 4x Titan (Holo).\" Seller (and SkinBids cofounder) Luksusbums <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Luksusbums/status/1592935740459347969\">said last year</a> that he would \"entertain offers above $400K\" for that gun, a valuation that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rexi_cs/status/1648030823428546560\">was apparently met</a> with this sale.</p>\n<p>While there are many sought-after skins in <em>CS:GO</em>, the \"Seed 661\" pattern seen on this AK-47 is \"commonly considered the #1 pattern and... is known as the best 'scar pattern'\" according to informational site <a href=\"https://csgobluegem.com/ak-47/ak-47-seed-pattern-661/\">CS Go Blue Gem</a>. The pattern is particularly valued aesthetically for what the site calls \"a clean and bright blue all the way through the back with a golden scar close to the rear sight.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932638#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932638&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5dc1139fb644fd73e31f578fbdb267957a0a66b7c12dff7bd865640658d3c37a","category":"Tech"}
