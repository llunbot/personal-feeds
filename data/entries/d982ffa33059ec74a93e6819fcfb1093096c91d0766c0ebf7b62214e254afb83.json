Subsequently my\nability to hear sounds at 1,000 Hz and above was greatly reduced.\nAmongst other things this meant that it was difficult to hear\nconsonants in speech, effectively making me partially deaf.</p>\n\n<p>I got a pair of AirPod Pro earbuds and set them up for my personal\nhearing needs. Later that day I went for a walk in my local woods\nand literally gasped out loud at hearing the birds I’d been\nmissing for some years!</p>\n\n<p>The way you set them up is buried deep in the Settings, so it’s\nnot surprising that not many people know about it. Here’s where\nyou need to go.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple can’t bill them as hearing aids for regulatory reasons, but I keep seeing reports from people who are hard of hearing who find AirPods Pro to be remarkable as audio accessibility devices.
