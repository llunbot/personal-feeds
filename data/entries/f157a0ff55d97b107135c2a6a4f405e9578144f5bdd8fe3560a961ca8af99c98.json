A combination of good design, a great camera, the right specs, and a low price makes it our usual recommendation for prospective Android phone buyers on a budget. The Pixel 7a presents more of that winning formula, and a few key upgrades this year make it so good that the more expensive Pixel phone directly above it—the $600 Pixel 7—is now basically obsolete.</p>\n<p><span></span>Since the phone has been <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-fold/\">fully unveiled</a> today, let's go over the specs. First up, the price—<a href=\"https://howl.me/cjIo9jM3Ozt\" target=\"_blank\">it's $500</a>, which is $50 more expensive than last year. That extra fifty bucks gets you some big upgrades over last year, though, like a 6.1-inch, 90 Hz, 2400×1080 OLED (the 6a has a 60 Hz display); 8GB of RAM (formerly 6GB); 7.5 W wireless charging (formerly no wireless charging); and a 64 MP main camera that's new to the Pixel line.</p>\n<p>Other expected specs are here, too, like a Google Tensor G2 SoC—that's the same chip the more expensive models have—plus 128GB of storage, IP67 dust and water resistance, 18 W wired charging, and Wi-Fi 6e. There's a marginally smaller battery, which is officially 4385 mAh (it was formerly 4500 mAh).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935766#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935766&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f157a0ff55d97b107135c2a6a4f405e9578144f5bdd8fe3560a961ca8af99c98","category":"Tech"}
