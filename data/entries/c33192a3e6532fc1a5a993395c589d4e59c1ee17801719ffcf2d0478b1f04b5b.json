Either way, the Apple Watch Series 10 model will eventually feature sleep apnea detection, perhaps via a later software update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, the new hypertension detection (high blood pressure) feature Apple appears to have been working on has been insufficiently reliable during testing, suggesting the feature is being delayed and \"no longer on the cards for an immediate release,\" according to Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe overall design of the Apple Watch Series 10 is said to be similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, but Apple has given them slightly larger screen-size options and the watch case itself is said to be noticeably thinner. Apple is expected to unveil the new models alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> at its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/\">September 9 event</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/apple-watch-10-sleep-apnea/\">'Noticeably Thinner' Apple Watch Series 10 to Eventually Get Sleep Apnea Detection</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/noticeably-thinner-apple-watch-series-10-to-eventually-get-sleep-apnea-detection.2435205/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c33192a3e6532fc1a5a993395c589d4e59c1ee17801719ffcf2d0478b1f04b5b","category":"Apple"}
