That shrinks Apple's share of the Chinese market to approximately 8%, while domestic brands now control 92% of smartphone shipments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor the entire first quarter, non-Chinese brand shipments declined over 25%, while total smartphone shipments in China actually increased by 3.3%.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's struggles come as domestic competitors have gained ground. Counterpoint Research <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/post-insight-research-notes-blogs-china-smartphone-sales-rise-25-yoy-in-q1-2025-driven-by-government-subsidies\">reports</a> Huawei now leads with a 19.4% share, followed by Vivo (17%), Xiaomi (16.6%), and Oppo (14.6%). Apple has slipped to fifth place with 14.1%.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSeveral factors are driving Apple's declining fortunes. The company faces competition from rejuvenated local brands like Huawei, which has rebounded with proprietary chips and its HarmonyOS Next software.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChinese government policies appear to be playing a role too. Under government subsidies, consumers of electronics get a 15% refund of products that are priced under 6,000 yuan ($820). Apple's standard iPhone 16 starts at 5,999 yuan.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn response to the declines, Apple is reportedly cutting prices on some iPhone 16 Pro models ahead of China's \"618\" shopping festival.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged the challenges during his <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-2q-2025-earnings/\">recent earnings call</a>, noting that revenue from Greater China dropped 2% in the quarter ending March 2025. That was actually an improvement compared to the 11% decline during the 2024 holiday season.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnalysts also believe Apple's slower adoption of generative AI features is a disadvantage in the innovative Chinese market.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Via <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250513PD229/china-smartphone-shipments-iphone-2025.html\">DigiTimes</a>.)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/13/iphone-shipments-down-china-local-brands/\">iPhone Shipments Crash 50% in China as Local Brands Dominate</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-shipments-crash-50-in-china-as-local-brands-dominate.2456990/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2adcf58f40f546e709a3cee55710fc44a5dbfc72b0d10327e23a62c2cf9dc490","category":"Apple"}
