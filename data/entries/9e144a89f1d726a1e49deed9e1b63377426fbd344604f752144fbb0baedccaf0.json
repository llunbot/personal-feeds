{"title":"First Ride Review: SRAM Motive Ultimate Brakes – Travis Engel","link":"https://theradavist.com/sram-motive-ultimate-brakes-review/","date":1743084004000,"content":"<p><em>The new <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/sram/\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM</a> Motive brake has a bit of everything. The power is similar to a Code, the weight is similar to a Level, and the fluid is similar to baby oil. But don’t put it on your baby. Put it on your bike. <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/travis-engel/\" target=\"_blank\">Travis</a> did, and although they’re not perfect, they’re on his bike to stay.</em><span></span></p>\n<p>Few bike-spec choices are more personal than brakes. The only components we’re more intimately connected to are saddles, grips, and <i>maybe</i> pedals. Each brake brand has its own “feel.” Most bike parts aren’t like that. Dropper posts don’t really have a feel. Nor do cranks or hubs or rear derailleurs. But for example, Hope brakes feel precise. Shimanos feel light. Maguras feel … kinda weird if you ask me.</p>\n<p>And SRAM brakes feel heavy, a statement that I actually mean to be completely neutral. Heavy can be good or bad depending on how you feel about <i>feel</i>. SRAM brakes have a strong return spring, a broad lever blade, and a wooden bite point. That thread weaves through their entire lineup, even as that lineup has been shifting lately.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-12.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Oil Change</h3>\n<p>At the core of the shift is mineral oil. It doesn’t absorb water like DOT fluid, so SRAM’s recommended interval between system bleeds goes from one year to two years. It’s also ok to throw away a mineral-oil-soaked shop rag, while DOT fluid is hazardous waste. And if a drop of mineral oil lands unnoticed on your forearm, it won’t eat through your skin like DOT will. Ask me how I know.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-DB8-lever.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-DB8-lever.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-DB8-lever.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-DB8-lever.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-DB8-caliper.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-DB8-caliper.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-DB8-caliper.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-DB8-caliper.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The DB8 was SRAM’s first mineral-oil brake back in 2022. Then in 2024, they added the high-powered Mavens. Both of those product families are getting expanded today, which <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/?p=355097&amp;preview=true\" target=\"_blank\">we cover briefly in a Radar post.</a> The new model I’m talking about here is a bit more interesting. The SRAM Motive is an upper-middle-power, mineral-oil brake that lands somewhere between the Code and the Level. After the G2 was discontinued, it’s probably accurate to think of the SRAM Motive as a lighter-weight but higher-powered G2 replacement.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>SRAM Motive Caliper</h3>\n<p>The Motive caliper is a lot like the Code caliper, inside and out. It’s got the same 15 mm and 16 mm piston sizing and the same moderately bulky silhouette. It’s still a two-piece design, still connected with two bolts, and still uses Code pads (now simply called “Large” in the SRAM catalog). The pads still can be removed from the top, while the bulkier Maven caliper meant they could only come in through the bottom. I can’t think of much else to say here. It’s a caliper.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-5.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>SRAM Motive Lever</h3>\n<p>This part is more interesting. There’s no contact-point adjustment knob on any of the new Motive levers. There’s still a reach adjustment, of course, but contact-point is a feature some SRAM brakes have that works a bit like a cable brake’s barrel adjuster. And honestly, I’m not the least bit sad to see it go. Aside from <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/promising-but-inconclusive-a-sram-maven-disc-brake-first-ride-review/\" target=\"_blank\">my brief time with the Mavens</a> (which I’ll revisit later), I’ve never set a SRAM contact adjuster a single click out of the quickest / shortest setting. It kinda just adds weight, complexity, and cost. So, no love lost. There is some <i>leverage</i> lost, though, with the entire Motive lineup also eschewing SRAM’s Swing Link for the simpler Directlink. Swing Link a linkage mechanism between the lever and the master cylinder that multiplies your mechanical advantage later in the stroke. The idea is to give you more power when you need it most, while potentially allowing the pads to rest farther from the rotor because they’re moving farther early in the stroke.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-1.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-7.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-7.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Shedding Swing Link and contact-point adjustment helped make for a pretty lightweight package. It seems like that’s what these are all about. The press release SRAM sent us detailing the Motive is peppered with terms like “modern XC,” “XC Race,” and even “World Cup XC,” plus a few comparisons to their cross-country-oriented Level brakes. Despite that press release also including some Code comparisons, SRAM sure did deliver on the whole lightweight thing. The highest-end non-carbon-blade “Motive Silver” brake has a claimed weight of 273 grams without rotor or mounting hardware. The 4-piston “Level Silver” claimed weight is only 18 grams lighter. Before installing the SRAM Motives on my personal bike I had just finished a couple weeks riding those 4-piston Levels on a test bike. So, let’s talk about it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-08.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-08.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-08.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-08.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Ride Impressions</h3>\n<p>The SRAM Motive feels like a SRAM brake. Shocker, right?. Despite all the XC nods in the marketing language, they’re quite <i>muscular</i> if you’ll forgive my struggle to find provocative new adjectives. I installed them on a bike previously equipped with Codes. With regards to the lever sensation and the initial bite force, the difference between the two is subtle. I even performed my rear Motive brake’s burn-in procedure with a Code brake still installed on the front. They felt like long-lost twins. And sure enough, I didn’t feel the need for a contact-point adjustment.</p>\n<h3>Sram Motive Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Designed for the “trail” category, between aggressive XC and light all-mountain</li>\n<li>The third new model family in SRAM’s lineup to use mineral oil brake fluid</li>\n<li>15mm / 16mm caliper pistons, same size as Code brake</li>\n<li>Lighter, simpler Directlink lever linkage instead of more powerful Swing Link</li>\n<li>No contact point adjustment</li>\n<li>Tool-free reach adjustment on all price points</li>\n<li>Available in “Ultimate Expert” kit version, including bleed kit, multiple pad compounds and rotor sizes</li>\n<li>266 grams per brake as tested (Ultimate model, weighed without rotor or mounting hardware)</li>\n<li>$175 to $275 per brake</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I followed the recommended bleed procedure, complete with a “piston massage” to get the caliper seals all limber and the piston positions all symmetrical. And the resulting deadstroke is comfortingly short. My only ergonomics nitpick is tangentially related to SRAM’s <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/headset-cable-routing/\">headset-routing</a>-inspired “Stealth” lever shape. Stealth levers rock the master cylinder closer to the bar, consequently rocking the lever pivot <i>away</i> from the bar. Moving a lever pivot forward causes the natural arch of the lever blade to prematurely diverge from the natural direction of your braking finger, costing you a small amount of power and comfort late in the lever stroke. But I’m oddly sensitive to lever pivot position, so take that with a grain of salt. The Motive pivot is still closer to the bar than Hayes, TRP, and those weird Magura brakes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-10.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>One aspect of the lever’s feel that I <i>did</i> like was the lack of a Swing Link. Don’t get me wrong, a linkage-actuated lever makes a lot of sense. Shimano’s Servo-Wave is similar, and it’s almost a cheat-code. You get a little extra power during those desperate white-knuckle efforts. But <i>before</i> your knuckles go white, sometimes Swing Link feels odd. There’s a little invisible “gate” you have to push through. It’s like drawing a compound hunting bow versus the wooden one you used in summer camp. Sure, it’s more powerful, but where’s the subtlety? The romance? Pulling the Motives feels smooth and even. I appreciated the power consistency that provided in the mid-stroke. It made for better modulation than I’m used to in the Codes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Here’s where these brakes put a unique twist on that SRAM feel that I described as “heavy.” The blade shape and return spring are very SRAM. And the Motive’s bite point feels just as wooden as a Code. Again, I mean “heavy” and “wooden” simply as descriptors, not as the criticisms they may sound like. But immediately past that bite point, there’s a predictability that I found made it easier to put out the exact amount of power output I wanted. All this isn’t without its drawbacks, though. Codes do offer more peak power, or more accurately, <i>easier access</i> to peak power. In a few extreme situations, where I had to slow down in a steep section to make a turn, I felt my forearms burning. But those moments were rare. It’s a trade-off like any other. The Motives always delivered, I just had to put in some extra effort once in a while.</p>\n<p>If I were building a bike around optimizing those high-intensity maneuvers, I might go back to the Mavens. But in my Maven review, I mentioned the levers’ unsettling tendency to “pump out” when I pulled and released them in quick succession. The bite point would suddenly happen sooner, which wasn’t a good feeling on such a powerful brake. Since then, I’ve ridden other Mavens whose pump-out was nearly undetectable, but mine still did it unless I was braking hard and long enough to heat the caliper and loosen things up. I’ve met plenty of happy Maven owners since them, but most are more shreddy than me. I think my trails, topography, and riding style just may not be putting enough energy into my brakes for me to need—or <i>want</i>—a brake like the Maven. The Motive, though, is just my speed. In fact, I think they’re a lot of peoples’ speeds.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-11.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Tunability</h3>\n<p>For most of my time testing the Motives, I ran sintered metallic pads and SRAM’s thicker HS2 rotors, 180 rear, 200 front. Among the many possible configurations, that’s the most powerful without going to a 220mm rotor. And it was perfectly suited for my personal definition of “enduro.” I’ve gotten pretty good at braking late into corners, so I want a metallic pad’s quick initial bite. And when I’m just modulating my speed, that ramp-up had me tapping, not <i>dragging</i>, the Motive levers. But if I didn’t make it clear, there wasn’t the slightest hint of pump-out as I tapped. I’m not a scientist, but the hydraulic ratio created by the Motive’s 15mm/16mm pistons isn’t as extreme as the Maven’s 18mm/19.5mm. It’s a more down-to-earth approach for a more down-to-earth brake.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-09.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025-sram-motive-brake-review-09.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I only got one ride with the lower-powered combination of organic pads and lighter Centerline rotors. It wasn’t for me, but I could see the merits of that setup for riders who don’t ride in the San Gabriel Mountains, or don’t weigh 190 pounds, or don’t enjoy giving themselves whiplash when they slow down. It helped me understand why a brake that looks so much like a SRAM Code is getting compared to a SRAM Level. I opted for Level brakes on the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/review-2025-ari-signal-peak\" target=\"_blank\">Ari Signal Peak</a> I recently tested because a bike that’s so light and nimble is better served with calmer braking. The power came on slower, making the bike feel less twitchy. That’s the sensation I got with the lighter-duty Motive configuration, except that there was a noticeably deeper well to draw from when I really needed some extra umph.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-MAVEN-BREAKDOWN-PRICING.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-MAVEN-BREAKDOWN-PRICING.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-MAVEN-BREAKDOWN-PRICING.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-MAVEN-BREAKDOWN-PRICING.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>But I immediately went back to the metallic pads and burly rotors. And I’m going to stay there. As in the Motives staying on the bike I tested them on. Although I wouldn’t mind just <i>a little</i> more maximum power, I’m really curious to test out SRAM’s longevity claims around their mineral-oil brakes. But more importantly, I like how they feel.</p>\n<h3>Pros:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>(Almost) XC weight with (almost) enduro power</li>\n<li>Service-life and environmental benefits of mineral oil</li>\n<li>Good modulation</li>\n<li>Great feel (if you like the SRAM feel)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Some may find the Motives to lack peak power, while finding the Mavens to offer too much</li>\n<li>Very slight downgrade in ergonomics for those picky about lever-blade pivot point position</li>\n<li>You can’t just go to an auto parts store to get your brake fluid.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.sram.com/en/sram/mountain/collections/brakes\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sram-motive-ultimate-brakes-review/\">First Ride Review: SRAM Motive Ultimate Brakes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Engel","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"9e144a89f1d726a1e49deed9e1b63377426fbd344604f752144fbb0baedccaf0","category":"Cycling"}
