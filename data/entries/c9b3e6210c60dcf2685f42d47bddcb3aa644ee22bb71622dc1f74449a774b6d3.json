{"title":"Artifact Is Shutting Down After One Year","link":"https://medium.com/artifact-news/shutting-down-artifact-1e70de46d419","date":1705120976000,"content":"\n<p>Kevin Systrom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We’ve made the decision to wind down operations of the Artifact \napp. We launched a year ago and since then we’ve been working \ntirelessly to build a great product. We have built something that \na core group of users love, but we have concluded that the market \nopportunity isn’t big enough to warrant continued investment in \nthis way. It’s easy for startups to ignore this reality, but often \nmaking the tough call earlier is better for everyone involved. The \nbiggest opportunity cost is time working on newer, bigger and \nbetter things that have the ability to reach many millions of \npeople. I am personally excited to continue building new things, \nthough only time will tell what that might be. We live in an \nexciting time where artificial intelligence is changing just about \neverything we touch, and the opportunities for new ideas seem \nlimitless. </p>\n\n<p>I am particularly proud of all the work our small team of 8 has \naccomplished. For instance, our app was recently named the \neveryday essential app of the year by the Google Play Store. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Winning an award on Android is a little like winning the Canadian Football League title. Artifact had great potential — no surprise given its pedigree: Systrom and Mike Krieger are hall of famers for Instagram — but never became a top-tier iOS app.</p>\n\n<p>When it debuted a year ago, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/01/31/artifact\">I called it a disappointment</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s just <em>ads ads ads</em>, interrupting seemingly every single \narticle, every couple of paragraphs. This same “<em>man, I miss ad \nblockers</em>” feeling strikes me when I use Apple News too, but Apple \nNews articles have way fewer ads, and better ads, than what I’m \nseeing so far in articles I read in Artifact. “Like Apple News but \nworse” is not a good elevator pitch. [...] </p>\n\n<p>Instagram was an instant sensation because it was obviously such a \npremium experience. Great photos, with cool filters (which filters \nwere necessary to make phone camera pictures look great a decade \nago), a simple social concept, all wrapped in a great app. \nArtifact does feel like a nice app, but the reading experience, at \nleast today, is anything but premium. It feels cheap. And the \nsocial aspect isn’t there yet. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I stuck with it all year, but have used it less than ever in recent months. In the first half of 2023, Artifact’s suggestions were improving steadily for me, but in recent months the quality of the suggestions dropped off a cliff for me. Lots of clickbait.</p>\n\n<p>They added the social component, with the ability to post articles and add comments, but those features didn’t make the overall product any better. And while the core reading experience improved, it never improved to the point where it was as good as reading in Safari. Their refusal to focus on providing first and foremost a premium <em>reading</em> experience is exemplified by their own blog post announcing their shutdown. It looks <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/01/shutting-down-artifact-medium-box-mac.png\">like this on MacOS</a>, and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/01/shutting-down-artifact-medium-box-iphone.png\">this on iOS</a>. You literally can’t even read the first sentence of the article on the iPhone until you click the little box to dismiss Medium’s dickbox.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/12/artifact-becomes-an-artifact\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c9b3e6210c60dcf2685f42d47bddcb3aa644ee22bb71622dc1f74449a774b6d3","category":"Tech"}
