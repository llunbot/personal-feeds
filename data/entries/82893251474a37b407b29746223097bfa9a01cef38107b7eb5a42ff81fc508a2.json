More ear, cheek, and extra back of the head protection. But light enough, comfy enough, and well-ventilated enough that you will really ride in it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been riding with the new Trigger X for a month now – from wet winter weather to sweating through unexpectedly summery blasts of heat. And I’m pretty happy to pull it on for those more technical trail rides, and a bit extra sense of security…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The safest helmet is the one that you actually wear, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iXS Trigger X open 3/4 shell enduro mountain bike helmet</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_rock-riding.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_rock-riding.jpg\" alt=\"iXS Trigger X MIPS lightweight open three-quarter shell enduro mountain bike helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_rock-riding.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_rock-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_rock-riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_rock-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_rock-riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_rock-riding-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_rock-riding-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>iXS talks about their new Trigger X like it matches your mullet hairdo attitude. “<em>Party in the front, protection in the back</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I guess the mullet analogy is a pretty good fit for this new 3/4-shell lid. The Trigger X strikes a nice balance between Swiss protection maker iXS’s Trigger AM half-shell and their wildly-light full-face <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ixs-trigger-ff-squeezes-in-with-lightest-full-face-helmet-at-600g/\" target=\"_blank\">Trigger FF</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those types of rides where you think a full-face would be overkill, but you feel like a lightweight XC helmet is equally inappropriate. Essentially, the iXS Trigger X offers enough protection that you can feel good about your decision-making skills even on days when you get shuttled to the top of the hill. And yet you can still wear it when you pedal up the climbs, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_trailside.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_trailside.jpg\" alt=\"iXS Trigger X MIPS lightweight open three-quarter shell enduro mountain bike helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_trailside.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_trailside-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_trailside-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_trailside-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_trailside-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_trailside-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_trailside-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>iXS calls the Trigger X helmet, a “streamlined open-face helmet with full protection”. It gets a MIPS Air system to protect against rotational impacts. The traditional multi-part in-mold polycarbonate over EPS helmet features open ear “SlapGuards” that taper around your head to protect from side impacts. The EPS of those SlapGuards is also separate of the main helmet body, so you can flex them out to the sides quite a bit to comfortably pull the 3/4 shell over your ears.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_adjustment-rear-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_adjustment-rear-detail.jpg\" alt=\"iXS Trigger X MIPS light 3/4-shell enduro MTB helmet, rear detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_adjustment-rear-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_adjustment-rear-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_adjustment-rear-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_adjustment-rear-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_adjustment-rear-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_adjustment-rear-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_adjustment-rear-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo by Rupert Fowler/Mountain Bike Connection)\n</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The iXS ErgoFit Ultra system offers horizontal and vertical adjustment, with a big rubber-coated dial to adjust a secure fit on your head.

But thanks to a climate in crisis, I feel like I’ve ridden through 3 seasons. On the colder and wetter end of the spectrum, I’ve probably most noticed how open and vented the new 3/4 helmet is. It does fit well under the hood of a couple of my trail rain jackets (Velocio &amp; Leatt, so far). And a classic thin Buff underneath has kept my ears and brow warm, without messing with the Trigger X fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_airborne-with-iXS-goggles.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_airborne-with-iXS-goggles.jpg\" alt=\"iXS Trigger X MIPS lightweight open three-quarter shell enduro mountain bike helmet, riding with iXS goggles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_airborne-with-iXS-goggles.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_airborne-with-iXS-goggles-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_airborne-with-iXS-goggles-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_airborne-with-iXS-goggles-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_airborne-with-iXS-goggles-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_airborne-with-iXS-goggles-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the warmer extremes of my winter/spring around 20°C (68°F), I certainly did start to sweat in the iXS Trigger X. But the thin integrated MIPS Air pads did a good job of soaking up my sweat, and not dripping it down my glasses. Plus, the MIPS Air system doesn’t block any of the vents or internal channels, so airflow is pretty good even at slow MTB climbing speeds. Most pleasantly surprisingly, the ear openings are plenty large to let my big lobes shed heat. And while the check pads also got sweaty by the end of a warm afternoon ride, it was never unpleasant. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_sometimes-you-hike-back-up.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_sometimes-you-hike-back-up.jpg\" alt=\"iXS Trigger X MIPS lightweight open three-quarter shell enduro mountain bike helmet, hike-a-bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_sometimes-you-hike-back-up.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_sometimes-you-hike-back-up-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_sometimes-you-hike-back-up-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_sometimes-you-hike-back-up-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_sometimes-you-hike-back-up-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-MIPS-lightweight-open-three-quarter-shell-enduro-mountain-bike-helmet_sometimes-you-hike-back-up-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fit Review</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_wet-Unno-riding.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_wet-Unno-riding.jpg\" alt=\"iXS Trigger X MIPS light 3/4-shell enduro MTB helmet, wet riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_wet-Unno-riding.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_wet-Unno-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_wet-Unno-riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_wet-Unno-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_wet-Unno-riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_wet-Unno-riding-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/iXS-Trigger-X-open-three-quarter-enduro-helmet_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-for-Mountain-Bike-Connection-Agency_wet-Unno-riding-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo by Rupert Fowler/BCA)\n</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A tricky thing to any helmet that wraps around the side of your head is fit. My 58.5cm circumference melon fit nicely inside the Medium Trigger X. And all I had to do was swap in the thinner cheek/ear pads included with the helmet for a comfortable, but not constricting fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the wide-ranging dial rear adjustment secures the helmet on my head, so it never felt like the ear “SlapGuards” were pressing against my head.
