This is not the first time Boeing has reported a financial loss on Starliner. Including the new charge announced Wednesday, Boeing has now suffered an overall loss on the program of nearly $1.6 billion since 2016.</p>\n<p>These losses have generally been caused by schedule delays and additional work to solve problems on Starliner. When NASA awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract to complete development of the Starliner spacecraft a decade ago, the aerospace contractor projected the capsule would be ready to fly astronauts by the end of 2017.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040414#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040414&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"66d471c14e80b2ccd5bc7ee6ea8d1c4a99f1358182b9fc9c91f667e92574adb2","category":"Tech"}
