{"title":"Quick Video: Using the Edge 840 Touchscreen With Rain & Gloves","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/04/garmin-edge-840-rain-touchscreen-gloves.html","date":1681410377000,"content":"<p></p>\n<p>Here’s a super quick post, for a super quick video, to demonstrate something that’s been frequently requested: Using the Edge 840 touchscreen with rain/water on the screen, as well as how it works with gloves.</p>\n<p>I had meant to include this footage in my <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/04/garmin-edge840-solar-cycling-gps-in-depth-review.html\">Edge 840 in-depth review video</a>, but totally forgot. Either way, it’s here now in a very straightforward video linked above.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for Edge 1040 footage of the same thing, but in an outright thunderstorm, you can find that down below from last summer. I had hoped to have some harder Florida-style rain for the Edge 840 video, but the only time that happened recently was at night – so the video wouldn’t have come out very well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With that – thanks for reading, or watching, as it may be!</p><div>\n<h3>Found This Post Useful?
