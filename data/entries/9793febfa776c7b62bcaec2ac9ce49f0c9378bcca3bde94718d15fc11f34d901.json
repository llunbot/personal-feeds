{"title":"Seven years later, Nintendo proves Metroid Prime 4 still exists","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032147","date":1718726436000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div></div>\n<p>It has now been almost exactly seven years since <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/core-pokemon-rpg-metroid-prime-4-coming-to-nintendo-switch/\">Nintendo first announced <em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> and over five years since the company said it was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/nintendo-throws-out-metroid-prime-4-work-restarts-with-retro-studios/\">restarting work on the game</a> with series mainstay Retro Studios. Now, Nintendo has finally shared the first glimpse of gameplay for the renamed <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which is now planned for a 2025 release.</p>\n<p>\"After a very long time, we are finally able to share more information about this title,\" Nintendo executive Shinya Takahashi said during <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX3BkD5PVUM\">today's livestreamed Nintendo Direct presentation</a>, showing a remarkable talent for understatement. Takahashi went on to also ask that fans \"please wait a little bit longer\" for additional information before the game's planned release next year.</p>\n<p>That \"additional information\" should include whether the highly anticipated game will launch for the Switch—as was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/core-pokemon-rpg-metroid-prime-4-coming-to-nintendo-switch/\">promised in 2017</a>—or for Nintendo's next console, which the company <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/nintendo-pre-announces-a-switch-2-announcement-is-coming-eventually/\">recently teased via a pre-announcement announcement</a>. Nintendo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1802702745276662114\">kept its promise</a> that \"there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor\" during today's Nintendo Direct presentation, but a major first-party franchise game launching in 2025 definitely seems well-positioned to serve as a showcase for new hardware that Nintendo seems to be planning for around the same time frame.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032147#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032147&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9793febfa776c7b62bcaec2ac9ce49f0c9378bcca3bde94718d15fc11f34d901","category":"Tech"}
