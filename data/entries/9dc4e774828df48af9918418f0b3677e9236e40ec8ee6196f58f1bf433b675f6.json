Since then, the company has been rapidly developing its constellation of broadband satellites in low-Earth orbit. SpaceX has now launched about 6,000 satellites with its Falcon 9 rocket and has delivered on its promise to provide fast Internet around the world. Today, the company is the largest satellite operator in the world by a factor of 10.</p>\n<p>But is this massive enterprise to deliver Internet from space profitable?</p>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/05/just-5-years-after-its-first-launch-the-starlink-constellation-is-profitable/\">new report by Quilty Space</a>, the answer is <em>yes</em>. Quilty built a model to assess Starlink's profitability. First, the researchers assessed revenue. The firm estimates this will grow to $6.6 billion in 2024, up from essentially zero just four years ago. In addition to rapidly growing its subscriber base of about 3 million, SpaceX has also managed to control costs. Based upon its model, therefore, Quilty estimates that Starlink's free cash flow from the business will be about $600 million this year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027115#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027115&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9dc4e774828df48af9918418f0b3677e9236e40ec8ee6196f58f1bf433b675f6","category":"Tech"}
