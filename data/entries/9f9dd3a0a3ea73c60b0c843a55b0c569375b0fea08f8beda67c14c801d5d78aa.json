Many Kias made between 2011-2021, and Hyundais from 2015-2021, lacked electronic engine immobilizers, which would prevent a car from starting unless an electronically matched key was present. Without the immobilizer, the car could be started by turning the ignition with other objects, such as a USB-A cable that thieves discovered was a perfect fit.</p>\n<p>Customers whose cars were totaled are eligible for up to $6,125, while damaged vehicles and property can receive a maximum of $3,375, along with costs for raised insurance, car rental, towing, tickets, and others. Kia and Hyundai had previously pledged to provide free software upgrades to vehicles and free wheel locks (i.e. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Club_(automotive)\">The Club</a>), typically in coordination with regional police departments. The NHTSA said in February that the companies have given out 26,000 wheel locks since November 2022.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940470#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940470&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9f9dd3a0a3ea73c60b0c843a55b0c569375b0fea08f8beda67c14c801d5d78aa","category":"Tech"}
