The new <a href=\"https://www.thule.com/en-us/bike-rack/hitch-bike-racks/thule-verse-_-903452\" target=\"_blank\">Verse</a> uses a clean aesthetic with a premium look and fits a greater range of bikes.

The trays are rated to hold up to 60 lbs each, and for those with heavy bikes or eBikes, the Thule foldable loading ramp is compatible with the new Verse.
