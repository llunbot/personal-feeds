{"title":"Washington Post: ‘Biden Justice Department Downplayed U.K. Demand for Apple “Back Door”’","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/26/intelligence-chief-tulsi-gabbard-will-fight-egregious-apple-back-door-order/","date":1740615127000,"content":"\n<p>Joseph Menn, reporting for The Washington Post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The U.S. Justice Department told Congress in November there were\nno major disputes with the United Kingdom over how the two allies\nseek data from each other’s communication companies.</p>\n\n<p>But at that time, officials knew British authorities were\npreparing a demand that Apple build a back door to its users’\nencrypted data, according to people familiar with the process, who\nspoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal department\nmatters. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The department said it reminded its British counterpart of the\nCLOUD Act’s “requirement that the terms of the Agreement shall not\ncreate any obligation that providers be capable of decrypting\ndata.” The report did not mention the looming order, and said any\ndemands for reduced security would come under Britain’s\nInvestigatory Powers Act, and so were not within the scope of the\nCLOUD Act.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, Sen. Alex Padilla and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, both\nCalifornia Democrats, faulted the November certification, saying\n“it splits the finest of hairs” by suggesting that the CLOUD Act\ndidn’t apply to any decryption order. The two lawmakers, who sit\non the Judiciary committees in their respective chambers of\nCongress, asked Bondi to reconsider whether Britain was violating\nthe Cloud Act by ordering a break to Apple’s encryption.</p>\n\n<p>Two of the people familiar with the certification process said the\nFBI has pursued backdoor capabilities unsuccessfully in the United\nStates and would have been in a stronger legal position to win\nthat if Apple had already had to create such a mechanism for\nanother government.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just utterly disgraceful behavior from the Biden administration — choosing to look the other way at a clear violation of the CLOUD Act to help their purported buddies in the UK, at the direct expense of a US company’s autonomy and US citizens’ privacy. I don’t see how this dissembling can be defended. Upon learning of the UK’s odious demands on Apple, the Biden administration’s response wasn’t to defend Apple (or Americans’ privacy), but instead to <em>try to hide it from Congress.</em> Unreal.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/wapo-biden-justice-department-backdoor\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d47210b56b644362dab33ce6e2d4169ec7c462fbed5eff300d998fb2c52ca23a","category":"Tech"}
