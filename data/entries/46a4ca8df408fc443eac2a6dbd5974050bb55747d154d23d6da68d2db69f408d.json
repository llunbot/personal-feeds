Although extremely light on details, the report says Microsoft is contributing \"support\" and \"engineering resources\" to AMD to improve its products' performance in AI workloads.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg also says that AMD is working on a Microsoft-developed AI accelerator named \"Athena,\" which The Information reported details on last month.
