On each end is a ‘stopper’ ridge that effectively provides a fixing ‘bookend’ for the custom-shaped DT Swiss hubs.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Syncros Capital SL manufacturing\" title=\"Syncros Capital SL manufacturing\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Once out of the mould, glue is applied to the hub shell.

The jig then holds the wheel still to enable the glue to set.</p>\n<h2>Syncros Capital SL wheelsets key stats</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Syncros Capital SL rear wheel\" title=\"Syncros Capital SL rear wheel\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The wheelset at BikeRadar Towers is the 40mm-deep Capital SL.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The 40mm-deep Syncros Capital SL wheelset we’ve got our hands on exhibits a progressive rim profile – 25mm wide internally, with a hookless design.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the deeper Capital SL Aero wheelset has a 23mm front-wheel width (internal), married to a 25mm rear-rim width.</p>\n<p>Both arc in a U-shape, with external widths tailored to the individual wheel’s role and dimensions.</p>\n<p>Both 40mm-deep Capital SL wheels measure 31.5mm externally.
