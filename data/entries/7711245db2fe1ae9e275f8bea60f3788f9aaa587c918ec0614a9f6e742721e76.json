It worked great until last Friday, when <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/beeper-minis-imessage-app-for-android-is-broken-possibly-by-apple/\">it didn't work at all</a>.</p>\n<p>What stung her wasn't the return to being the Android interloper in the chats again. It wasn't the resulting lower-quality images, loss of encryption, and strange \"Emphasized your message\" reaction texts. It was losing messages during the outage and never being entirely certain they had been sent or received. There was a gathering on Saturday, and she had to double-check with a couple people about the details after showing up inadvertently early at the wrong spot.</p>\n<p>That kind of grievance is why, after Apple on Wednesday appeared to have blocked what Beeper described as \"~5% of Beeper Mini users\" from accessing iMessages, both co-founder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1735131934484029914\">Eric Migicovksy</a> and the app told users <a href=\"https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1735315504880123995\">they understood if people wanted out</a>. The app had already suspended its plans to charge customers $1.99 per month, following the first major outage. But this was something more about \"how ridiculously annoying this uncertainty is for our users,\" Migicovsky posted.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991118#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991118&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7711245db2fe1ae9e275f8bea60f3788f9aaa587c918ec0614a9f6e742721e76","category":"Tech"}
