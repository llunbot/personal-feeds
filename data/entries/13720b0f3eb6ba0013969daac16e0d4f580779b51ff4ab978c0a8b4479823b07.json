Until now, ‌Visual Intelligence‌ has been a feature limited to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models, but it will now be available on all iPhones that support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-Visual-Intelligence.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nSince there is no Camera Control button on the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro Max, ‌Visual Intelligence‌ can be activated through the Action Button or through a Control Center option. There is a new Action Button setting for ‌Visual Intelligence‌, along with new Control Center buttons for activating the feature. On all ‌iPhone 16‌ models, ‌Visual Intelligence‌ can now be activated through the Action Button, so it is no longer limited to the Camera Control button on the ‌iPhone 16‌, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, and 16 Pro Max. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsing ‌Visual Intelligence‌ through the Action Button and Control Center is functionality that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-visual-intelligence/\">implemented for the iPhone 16e</a>, which supports ‌Visual Intelligence‌ but also does not have a Camera Control button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter releasing the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a> with ‌Visual Intelligence‌, Apple said that it would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/visual-intelligence-coming-to-iphone-15-pro/\">come to the iPhone 15 Pro models</a> as well. ‌Visual Intelligence‌ is a camera feature that is designed to let you learn more about the places and objects that are around you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Visual Intelligence‌ can use the camera to summarize text, translate, read text aloud, search Google for objects, ask ChatGPT for information about an object or a place, and more.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/\">Visual Intelligence</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/ios-18-4-visual-intelligence-iphone-15-pro/\">iOS 18.4 Adds Visual Intelligence to iPhone 15 Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-adds-visual-intelligence-to-iphone-15-pro.2451217/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"13720b0f3eb6ba0013969daac16e0d4f580779b51ff4ab978c0a8b4479823b07","category":"Apple"}
