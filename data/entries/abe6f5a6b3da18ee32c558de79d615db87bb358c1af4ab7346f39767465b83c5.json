To install an update, the Vision Pro headset needs to be removed, and there is a software progress bar available on the front EyeSight display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's ‌visionOS 2‌ update allows users to create 3D spatial photos from 2D images, taking advantage of depth information and machine learning to add natural-looking depth and dimension.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Home View can now be customized and apps can be moved around, and Apple added a new Bora Bora Environment. Environments have also been updated so that you can see your Magic Keyboard or MacBook keyboard while you're immersed, so it's easier to type, plus you can use them with Safari when watching web-based videos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPersonas have more accurate skin tones and more vibrant clothing color options, plus hand movement animations have been updated to be more fluid and natural. For controlling the Vision Pro, there are new pinch and rotate gestures for getting to the Home View, accessing Control Center, controlling volume, and checking battery level.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can now use a mouse with the Vision Pro, and Apple improved Guest Mode so the most recent guest's hand and eye data is saved for 30 days for easier access without repeat setups.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLater this year, ‌visionOS 2‌ will support a larger ultrawide view for a connected Mac, and support for Multiview for MLS and MLB games.
