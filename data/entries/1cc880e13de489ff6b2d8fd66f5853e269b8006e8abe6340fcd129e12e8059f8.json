The two-stack OLED design can generate the same brightness levels as a single-stack design, but with significantly reduced power consumption and extended lifespan. The iPhone currently uses a single stack OLED display with one light-emitting layer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOmdia's latest prediction is an adjustment to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-oled-roadmap/\">forecast published earlier this year</a>, in which it said Apple will  launch 8.3-inch iPad mini and 10.8-inch iPad Air models with OLED displays in 2026. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe research firm now appears to be leaning towards the possibility that Apple will launch an OLED foldable in the next few years in the form of a 7- to 8-inch device that could ultimately replace the 8.3-inch iPad mini. According to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-foldable-2026-could-replace-ipad-mini/\">previous report</a>, Apple is reviewing a launch timeframe for such a device between 2026 and 2027. The latest report however does not mention whether Kang Min-soo offered his own timeframe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's next-generation OLED iPad Pro models are expected to be announced in a matter of weeks, according to multiple sources. They are rumored to have a thinner design, an M3 chip, improved cameras, MagSafe wireless charging, and a redesigned Magic Keyboard accessory that makes the iPad Pro more laptop-like.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also working on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/\">two non-OLED versions of the iPad Air</a>, in 10.9 and 12.9-inch sizes, similar to the two sizes of the iPad Pro. These iPad Air models are expected to be introduced as soon as late March alongside the new OLED iPad Pro models.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theelec-kr/\">The Elec</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/\">OLED iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/ipad-air-oled-adoption-timeline/\">iPad Air Next on Apple's OLED Tablet Roadmap Following iPad Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-air-next-on-apples-oled-tablet-roadmap-following-ipad-pro.2421988/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1cc880e13de489ff6b2d8fd66f5853e269b8006e8abe6340fcd129e12e8059f8","category":"Apple"}
