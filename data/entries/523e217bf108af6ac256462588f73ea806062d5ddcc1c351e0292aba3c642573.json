Apple says it considers a product \"obsolete\" once seven years have passed since the company last distributed it for sale.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple launched the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in September 2014, with key features including larger screens than previous models and Apple Pay support. Apple discontinued the iPhone 6 Plus in September 2016, but the iPhone 6 remained available through resellers in select countries for a few more years, so it is not yet considered \"obsolete.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the software side, iOS 13 dropped support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 2019.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the iPad, Apple now considers the fourth-generation iPad mini to be \"vintage,\" meaning that more than five years have passed since the company stopped distributing the device for sale. Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers continue to offer repairs for vintage products for up to two more years, subject to parts availability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also added the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus to its \"vintage\" products list, but in the (PRODUCT)RED color only. The devices remained available in other colors for longer, so those colors are not \"vintage\" yet.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/\">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/01/apple-says-iphone-6-plus-is-now-obsolete/\">Apple Says iPhone 6 Plus Now 'Obsolete' and iPad Mini 4 Now 'Vintage'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-iphone-6-plus-now-obsolete-and-ipad-mini-4-now-vintage.2423274/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"523e217bf108af6ac256462588f73ea806062d5ddcc1c351e0292aba3c642573","category":"Apple"}
