Welcome to the third CyclingTips Field Test</h2><p>\n</p><p>It’s hardly a secret at this point that bikes are hard to come by, let alone a whole bunch of bikes in a single category. And so we decided to take a different approach for the latest CyclingTips Field Test. We once again tested and reviewed some of the latest and greatest machines that the industry has recently released to the world (or is soon about to), but we also set out to answer a bunch of questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can previous generation road bikes can still perform just as well as the newest models?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s the deal with flat-bar gravel bikes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fully integrated bar-and-stem combos with totally hidden routing look cool and are ostensibly more aero, but how big a pain are they, really?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help us in these endeavors, we summoned myself, CyclingTips editor-in-chief Caley Fretz, CyclingTips social media editor Mike Better, and freelancer extraordinary Dan Cavallari to our US headquarters of Boulder, Colorado, where even a bout of wildfire smoke couldn’t keep us from a week of intensive testing on a wide range of terrain, including glass-smooth blacktop, packed dirt, crushed gravel, rocky singletrack, and all sorts of combinations in between. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Included in this round-up are the following bikes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Bianchi Arcadex</li><li>BMC Roadmachine 01 Two</li><li>Cannondale SuperSix Evo CX</li><li>Canyon Endurace CF SLX 9.0 eTap</li><li>Marin DSX 2</li><li>Specialized Diverge Comp E5 Evo</li><li>Specialized Tarmac SL6 Sport</li><li>Trek Madone SL 7 eTap</li><li>Mystery bike #1 (to be revealed soon)</li><li>Mystery bike #2 (to be revealed even sooner!)</li><li>Mystery bike #3 (seriously, Caley?)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll be rolling out both written and video reviews of all of these bikes over the next few weeks — starting tomorrow — along with roundtable discussions on a variety of topics, including the ones mentioned above and then some.
