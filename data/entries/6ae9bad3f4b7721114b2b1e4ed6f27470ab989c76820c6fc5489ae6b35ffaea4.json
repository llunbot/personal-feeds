But none of them would go on to win. Nor would Belgian powerhouse Lotte Kopecky. Instead the winner was a little-known rider from Austria who was an amateur at the time, with a PhD in mathematics. Her name was Anna Kiesenhofer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kiesenhofer was part of a five-rider breakaway that took off from the flag drop. Their lead grew to 11 minutes, while behind Germany helped work to close the gap and various members of the Dutch team attempted to attack with no success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kiesenhofer kicked away on the Kagosaka Pass and found herself alone at the front with 41km still to go. Behind her, a duo of her former breakaway companions Omer Shapira (Israel) and Anna Plichta (Poland) were chasing some way back but were caught by the pack in the last 5km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no race radios, the Dutch riders swarming the front of the peloton believed they were now at the head of the race, unaware that Kiesenhofer was still up the road. So when Van Vleuten attacked and stormed her way across the line, she raised her arms in celebration, believing she had just won the gold medal. In fact, that had already been claimed by Kiesenhofer, who had crossed the finish line a minute earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mathematician had won Austria’s only gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and the country’s first since 2004.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/olympics-2024-preview\">Paris 2024 Olympics Cycling: Events, schedule, TV guide and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/josh-tarling-interview\">‘Everything leads towards the Olympics’: Josh Tarling Q&amp;A</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/inside-the-secretive-world-of-the-derny-pacer\">Inside the secretive world of the derny pacer</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/japanese-keirin-sport-and-culture-beyond-the-velodrome\">Japanese keirin: sport and culture beyond the velodrome</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>BMX brilliance</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435-970x546.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435.jpg 1600w\" /><figcaption>Ezra Shaw via Getty</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BMX is among the most recent additions for cycling at the Olympics, with BMX Racing having featured since 2008 and Freestyle appearing for the first time at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. With the new event came a new star for Britain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charlotte Worthington became the first ever BMX Freestyle Olympic Champion with an incredible performance that resulted in a score of 97.50, the maximum being 100. Part of her routine involved a 360° backflip, making her the first women in competition history to successfully land the trick, perfecting it on the second attempt after crashing on the first run.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"841\" height=\"561\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Alex-Broadway-edited.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Alex-Broadway-edited.jpg 841w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Alex-Broadway-edited-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Alex-Broadway-edited-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Alex-Broadway-edited-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Alex-Broadway-edited-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Alex-Broadway-edited-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Alex-Broadway-edited-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Britain also had success in the BMX Racing discipline, with Kye Whyte taking silver in the men’s event and Beth Shriever going one better to take gold in the women’s. Their medals came within 11 minutes of each other, and the pair celebrating together is one of the images of the games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The achievement is even more impressive when you consider the setback Shriever had been through to get there. UK Sport declared there would be no funding for the women’s BMX in the Tokyo Olympics cycle and Shriever dropped out of British Cycling’s programme in 2017. It took £50,000 of crowdfunding to get her to her gold medal moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Matt Walls’s historic Omnium gold</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"680\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Matt-Walls.webp\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Matt-Walls.webp 680w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Matt-Walls-300x188.webp 300w\" /><figcaption>Reuters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Track cycling takes many forms. Perhaps no event brings this home more than the omnium, which once boasted six events over two days at its most encompassing. In recent years it has changed its format, reducing to four events over one day to have a more endurance focus. The omnium now consists of the scratch race, tempo race, elimination race and points race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Tokyo Olympics, the scratch race kicked things off, and Great Britain’s Matt Walls won after 40 laps to immediately place himself at the top of the omnium standings. He then finished third and second in the tempo and elimination races to remain in the gold medal position by four points from the Netherlands’ Jan-Willem van Schip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just one event remained: the points race. This involves 100 laps of the velodrome, with one to five points awarded for position after every 10 laps, and 20 points awarded for lapping the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walls gained 19 sprint points and 20 lap points and it was enough for him to top the omnium table to win Great Britain’s first Omnium gold medal with 153 points.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A duo’s dominance on the track</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"607\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Laura-Kenny-Katie-Archibald-970x607.webp\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Laura-Kenny-Katie-Archibald-970x607.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Laura-Kenny-Katie-Archibald-300x188.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Laura-Kenny-Katie-Archibald-768x480.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Laura-Kenny-Katie-Archibald-1536x960.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Laura-Kenny-Katie-Archibald-2048x1281.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Laura-Kenny-Katie-Archibald-750x469.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Laura-Kenny-Katie-Archibald-1140x713.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>SW Pix</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Staying at the velodrome, the Tokyo Olympics marked the debut of the women’s Madison event, a two-rider, tag-team, hand-slinging battle over 120 laps. Great Britain had the experienced Katie Archibald and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no18-laura-kenny\" target=\"_blank\">Laura Kenny</a> as a pairing, both of whom were already Olympic gold medallists, Archibald in the team pursuit and Kenny across the team pursuit and omnium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one of the most dominant performances seen in a velodrome, Archibald and Kenny won ten of the 12 sprints available and lapped the field, amassing 78 points in total. Their closest competitors, Denmark, could only manage 35 points, which was still enough for silver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In winning the Madison with Archibald, Kenny became the most successful female Olympian for Great Britain.

With only a matter of weeks to the Olympics, it looked like his campaign had been left at the side of the road, but he underwent surgery to be on the start line of the cross-country mountain bike race in Japan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He avoided the early crash that forced the Netherlands’ Mathieu van der Poel to abandon and attacked persistently in the following laps, eventually gaining a gap on Switzerland’s Mathias Flueckiger and then leaving him behind completely on the penultimate lap. Pidcock had enough of an advantage to celebrate with a flag at the finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In winning Great Britain’s first Olympic gold in the race, he also became the youngest male winner in history.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/olympics-2024-preview\">Paris 2024 Olympics Cycling: Events, schedule, TV guide and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/josh-tarling-interview\">‘Everything leads towards the Olympics’: Josh Tarling Q&amp;A</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/inside-the-secretive-world-of-the-derny-pacer\">Inside the secretive world of the derny pacer</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/japanese-keirin-sport-and-culture-beyond-the-velodrome\">Japanese keirin: sport and culture beyond the velodrome</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tokyo-olympics-cycling-moments\">Five of the best cycling moments from the Tokyo Olympics</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6ae9bad3f4b7721114b2b1e4ed6f27470ab989c76820c6fc5489ae6b35ffaea4","category":"Cycling"}
