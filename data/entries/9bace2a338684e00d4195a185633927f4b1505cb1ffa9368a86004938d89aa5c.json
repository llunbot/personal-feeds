In many ways, the new MacBook Pro is a hardware Time Machine of its own; you could say it makes it seem like the past five years never happened.\n<p>The 2021 MacBook Pro is notably bulkier, more flexible, and more powerful than its predecessor. It clicks \"revert\" on a whole bunch of changes that have been generally unpopular, like the inclusion of the Touch Bar in place of physical function keys and the singular focus on Thunderbolt as the port of choice.</p>\n<p>The new laptop also has the most advanced CPU,  GPU, and NPU ever included in a consumer laptop and display technology that has never been seen in mainstream consumer products. So maybe it's not so much like the past five years never happened; it's more like we've slipstreamed into an alternate timeline where Apple never changed course at a critical juncture when a lot of people felt it shouldn't have.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808619#p3\">Read 94 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808619&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9bace2a338684e00d4195a185633927f4b1505cb1ffa9368a86004938d89aa5c","category":"Tech"}
