Ek wants the UK bill to make sure that a company that's the referee in the digital market \"can't also be the player.\" The DMCC needs to have \"real teeth\" he said, adding that the bill is for all developers. \"More and more of these developers are now finding that Apple is a competitor,\" he said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf passed, the DMCC would give the UK's Competition and Markets Authority the power to impose multibillion-pound fines for large companies that breach the established rules. Tech companies would be required to provide more transparency about how their app stores work, with regulators able to open up specific markets like app stores or search engines.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpotify has been in a feud with Apple for years, with the dispute between the two companies most recently heating up in 2022 when Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/25/spotify-audio-book-app-update-rejected-apple/\">rejected a Spotify app update</a> that added audiobook support. Spotify back in 2019 filed a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-complaint-vs-apple-in-europe/\">regulatory complaint</a> in the European Union over Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> practices, which is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/apple-responds-to-eu-narrowing-antitrust-case/\">still under investigation</a>, and the company has also backed the Open Markets Act in the United States, legislation that would require Apple to allow for sideloading and alternate app stores.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/spotify-apple-uk-legislation/\">Spotify CEO on Apple and Google: ‘If You Want to Be the Referee, You Can’t Also Be the Player’</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-ceo-on-apple-and-google-‘if-you-want-to-be-the-referee-you-can’t-also-be-the-player’.2406014/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0d29c091c961d8237cc1d0bc9d0bb84d587769856d4dce13188345fd706630b1","category":"Apple"}
