It has agreed to a deal with BMW of North America to recycle lithium-ion battery packs from BMW's electrified vehicles and will eventually use recycled material from Redwood in battery packs for BMWs built in North America as the automaker works toward a closed-loop supply chain.</p>\n<p>\"Our partnership with BMW of North America ensures responsible end-of-life battery management that will improve the environmental footprint of lithium-ion batteries, help decrease cost and, in turn, increase access and adoption of electric vehicles,\" said Cal Lankton, chief commercial officer at Redwood Materials.</p>\n<p>Redwood was founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel in 2017, and in recent years, the startup has signed partnerships with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/ford-volvo-and-redwood-materials-start-recycling-ev-batteries/\">Ford, Volvo</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/volkswagen-partners-with-redwood-materials-to-recycle-ev-batteries/\">Volkswagen</a>, and more recently <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/gm-to-recycle-10k-tons-of-ev-battery-materials-a-year-with-redwood-deal/\">General Motors</a>. These companies route end-of-life battery packs (and, in the case of GM, battery manufacturing scraps) to Redwood, where the nickel, cobalt, copper, lithium, and other minerals are recycled in a hydrometallurgy facility.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050767#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050767&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
