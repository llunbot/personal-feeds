While early reports suggested multiple carriers, including Verizon and T-Mobile, seemed to be affected, that appears to be a knock-on effect of a major network going down.</p>\n<p>As of late Thursday morning, AT&amp;T had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/22/tech/att-cell-service-outage/index.html\">told CNN Business</a> that most of its network had been restored. The Federal Communications Commission, along with other federal agencies, have been in touch with AT&amp;T about the outage, according to CNN.</p>\n<p>Service monitoring site <a href=\"https://downdetector.com/\">Downdetector</a> was showing multiple post-paid and pre-paid carriers as having increased outage reports starting at around 4 am Eastern time. An Ars editor in Texas has seen \"SOS\" on their iPhone since 4:30 am ET and has been unable to make Wi-Fi calls.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005172#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005172&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1aa96d897e9f674bcaf203aba63fd3619cfc34af1f963788109644d5f04f9429","category":"Tech"}
