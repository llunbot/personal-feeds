{"title":"AnandTech Is Closing Down","link":"https://www.anandtech.com/show/21542/end-of-the-road-an-anandtech-farewell","date":1725035509000,"content":"\n<p>Editor-in-chief Ryan Smith:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is with great sadness that I find myself penning the hardest\nnews post I’ve ever needed to write here at AnandTech. After over\n27 years of covering the wide — and wild — word of computing\nhardware, today is AnandTech’s final day of publication.</p>\n\n<p>For better or worse, we’ve reached the end of a long journey — one that started with a <a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/42/amd-k6-review\">review of an AMD processor</a>, and\nhas ended with the <a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/21524/the-amd-ryzen-9-9950x-and-ryzen-9-9900x-review\">review of an AMD processor</a>. It’s\nfittingly poetic, but it is also a testament to the fact that\nwe’ve spent the last 27 years doing what we love, covering the\nchips that are the lifeblood of the computing industry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Awful news. There was no publication like AnandTech before it was founded, and there’s been no publication like it since. To say that it will be sorely missed is a profound understatement. When founder Anand Lal Shimpi left the site <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2014/08/31/apple-hires-anand-lal-shimpi/\">to join Apple</a> 10 years ago, I was pretty skeptical that AnandTech could maintain relevance, let alone excellence. But it did, in spades. I’d go so far as to say it barely missed a beat. This news of a shutdown is just a gut punch. The only good news in the whole announcement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And while the AnandTech staff is riding off into the sunset, I am\nhappy to report that the site itself won’t be going anywhere for a\nwhile. Our publisher, Future PLC, will be keeping the AnandTech\nwebsite and its many articles live indefinitely. So that all of\nthe content we’ve created over the years remains accessible and\ncitable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why every publisher shutting down a site doesn’t do this, I’ll never understand. I’ll leave the final words to Smith:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Finally, I’d like to end this piece with a comment on the Cable\nTV-ification of the web. A core belief that Anand and I have held\ndear for years, and is still on our <a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/home/about/\">About page</a> to this\nday, is AnandTech’s rebuke of sensationalism, link baiting, and\nthe path to shallow 10-o’clock-news reporting. It has been our\nmission over the past 27 years to inform and educate our readers\nby providing high-quality content — and while we’re no longer\ngoing to be able to fulfill that role, the need for quality,\nin-depth reporting has not changed. If anything, the need has\nincreased as social media and changing advertising landscapes have\nmade shallow, sensationalistic reporting all the more lucrative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Amen.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/30/anandtech-is-closing-down\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4f9708df809ae9c94229801addc7972c1740cb9edb4bf96364bf28d6f8fd4862","category":"Tech"}
