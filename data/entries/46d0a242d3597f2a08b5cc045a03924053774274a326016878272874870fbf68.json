GRID Studio, for those unfamiliar, is a company that takes discarded Apple devices and turns them into wall art.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/GRID-1.jpg\" width=\"1348\" height=\"759\" />\r<br />\nEach GRID piece has a deconstructed Apple device with the components artfully displayed, with a sleek black frame to complement the parts. Labels make it clear what each part of the device was used for, and interesting and relevant details are included. There are a range different GRID Studio options that feature iPhones, iPads, and iPods, with prices that start at $40 and go up based on the complexity of the piece.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation\">GRID 1</a>, one of GRID Studio's most popular options, showcases the first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> that Apple ever made. Priced at $400, it features all of the components that Apple used for the original ‌iPhone‌ back in 2007. The ‌‌iPhone‌‌'s shell is positioned next to the power button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, ear piece, and other components. GRID does not include the original batteries from the device, but replicas are added so the battery is not missing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/grid-studio-grid-1.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s\">GRID 4s</a> is another iconic device that's available at a special price For Black Friday. Right now, it's just $99, down from the original $170 price tag. The Grid 4s has around 40 components from the ‌iPhone‌ 4s, all of which are neatly arranged and labeled.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/grid-iPhone4s.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nGRID Studio's <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-5\">$139 GRID 5</a> shows off the internal components from the 2012 ‌iPhone‌ 5. The ‌iPhone‌ 5 is notable because it was the first ‌iPhone‌ that was developed under Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a>, and the last ‌iPhone‌ that Apple CEO Steve Jobs was directly involved with. Compared to the ‌iPhone‌ 4s, the ‌iPhone‌ 5 brought a taller 4-inch display and it was also the first ‌iPhone‌ to feature a Lightning port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/GRID-iPhone-5.jpg\" width=\"1816\" height=\"1022\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPriced at $269, the <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/apple-iphone-x\">GRID X</a> features one of Apple's newer iPhones, the ‌iPhone‌ X. The ‌iPhone‌ X was the first to feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> instead of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a>, doing away with the Home button. It included the notch housing the TrueDepth camera system. The 2017 ‌iPhone‌ X inspired all of the modern Apple iPhones with its all-display design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/grid-studio-iphone-x.jpg\" width=\"1400\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nGRID Studio also offers bundles at a discount, such as the $299 <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/classic-kits-4s-5-6\">GRID Classic Kit</a>, which is available at this price point for a limited time. The GRID Classic Kit features the GRID 4, GRID 5, and GRID 6, highlighting all of the design changes Apple introduced from 2011 to 2013. This 3-in-1 deal is a good option if you're looking for some sleek office art.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/grid-studio-iphone-6.jpg\" width=\"1070\" height=\"788\" />\r<br />\nGRID Studio has <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/\">additional products on its website</a>, including other ‌iPhone‌ options and devices like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> and the Apple Watch.
