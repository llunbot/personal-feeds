As a reminder, the current iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus devices are available in Blue, Pink, Yellow, Green, and Black.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor the 6.1- and 6.7-inch iPhone 16 models, Apple is also planning a new vertical camera lens arrangement that is a departure from the prior diagonal lens setup. The new orientation, evidenced in the dummy units, will presumably allow the standard iPhone 16 models to capture Spatial Video for the Vision Pro headset, something only the iPhone 15 Pro models are currently capable of doing. Prior iPhones have used a square-shaped camera bump to accommodate the diagonal lenses, but Apple is able to slim down the camera bump with the new lens arrangement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are anticipated to include an A18 chip, 8GB of RAM, a new \"Capture\" button on the right side for photo and video, the Action button previously exclusive to iPhone 15 Pro models, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">more</a>. All four devices in the iPhone 16 series are expected to launch around mid-September. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonny-dickson/\">Sonny Dickson</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/revealed-iphone-16-colors-redesigned-camera/\">Revealed: iPhone 16 Colors and Redesigned Camera in Leaked Image</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/revealed-iphone-16-colors-and-redesigned-camera-in-leaked-image.2432593/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"79d877127267147aaf3f6a4b469a5a6f353672f3af213056d1def942916ea3d9","category":"Apple"}
