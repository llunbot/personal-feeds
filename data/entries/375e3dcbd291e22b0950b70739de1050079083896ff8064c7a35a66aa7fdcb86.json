{"title":"Apple Maps Cycling Directions Expand to New Zealand","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-maps-cycling-directions-new-zealand/","date":1727952154000,"content":"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a> has expanded the availability of cycling routes in the southern hemisphere by adding support for New Zealand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/maps-cycling-directions-new-zealand.jpg\" width=\"2796\" height=\"1419\" />\r<br />\nApple first added cycling directions to ‌‌Apple Maps‌‌ in iOS 14, providing specific directions for bike riders with bike lanes, bike paths, and bike-friendly routes that highlight steep inclines, stairs, and other obstacles.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrior to this expansion, cycling directions in ‌Apple Maps‌ were primarily available in select countries and major cities across North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. As for Oceania, the feature was previously limited to Australia, so the addition of New Zealand significantly enhances its coverage in the region.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple typically rolls out new features gradually, so users across New Zealand may see the cycling directions become available in stages. The company has not provided details about coverage within the country, but it is expected to include major urban areas and popular cycling routes. Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#maps-cycling\">maintains a list</a> of all of the areas where cycling directions are available on its website, but New Zealand has not yet been added. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, Josh!)</em><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/new-zealand/\">New Zealand</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-maps-cycling-directions-new-zealand/\">Apple Maps Cycling Directions Expand to New Zealand</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-maps-cycling-directions-expand-to-new-zealand.2438996/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"375e3dcbd291e22b0950b70739de1050079083896ff8064c7a35a66aa7fdcb86","category":"Apple"}
