A balance bike is the best way to help little ones learn how to scoot around so that when they’re ready for a pedal bike, they can hop on and get moving, no training wheels required.</p><p>Balance bikes don’t just teach balance, they teach body awareness and the ability to lean with the bike into corners and maneuver it around obstacles. (Don’t believe us? Check out these <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFzLlSm1zUo&amp;t=2s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cyclocross-racing toddlers on balance bikes</a>!)</p><p>But choosing the right balance bike can be tricky. Should you go for the super-cheap department store one? Or spent upwards of $1,000 to guarantee that your toddler has the ultimate advantage in weight savings? The answer, like most things in life, falls somewhere in the middle. Here, we’re looking at the balance bikes that offer the best value, the speediest trip around a race course, and the gnarliest fun on local singletrack.</p><p>Not sure what you need, or how to get your kiddo riding?

And as parents who really dislike changing our own flat tires, we deeply appreciate the solid foam rubber tires that can’t go flat—but are still grippy and avoid slideouts.</p><p>We also appreciate that Strider uses an extra-long seatpost to allow your kiddo to ride this bike with an inseam ranging from 12 to 20 inches. And the seatpost doesn’t require tools to adjust, so this bike truly is no muss, no fuss. While it’s not the cheapest bike on the market, it’s pretty darn close, and at $130, you’re getting a lot of bike for your buck. The resale / pass-down-ability of this bike is second to none, so compared to buying an ultra-cheap model off of Amazon, this one will likely end up more cost-effective in the long run.</p><ul><li>Material: Steel</li><li>Weight: 6.7 lbs</li><li>Wheel size: 12”</li><li>MSRP: $130</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: 7 colorways, great height range<br><strong>CONS</strong>: None, really<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;BEST LIGHTWEIGHT: <a href=\"https://mikesbikes.com/products/specialized-hotwalk-carbon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Specialized Hotwalk Carbon&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14094323/specialized-hotwalk-balance-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14094323/specialized-hotwalk-balance-bike.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14094323/specialized-hotwalk-balance-bike.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14094323/specialized-hotwalk-balance-bike-297x149.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14094323/specialized-hotwalk-balance-bike-800x400.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14094323/specialized-hotwalk-balance-bike-120x60.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14094323/specialized-hotwalk-balance-bike-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>Do you <em>need</em> a sub-5 pound balance bike for your mini-shredder?

Ideally, it’s best for children who are able to balance while toddling around with an inseam of 15-18″…and for parents who don’t care what it costs. <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/12/03/specialized-builds-their-lightest-bike-yet-the-4-63lb-hotwalk-carbon-balance-bike/\">Read more about it here.</a></p><ul><li>Material: Carbon</li><li>Weight: 4.63 lbs</li><li>Wheel size: 12”</li><li>MSRP: $1,000</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Sub-5 pounds makes this great for parents who carry the bike often on walks<br><strong>CONS</strong>: That price!<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;BEST MTB: <a href=\"https://airbornebicycles.com/products/gnome-balance-bike\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Airborne Gnome&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Airborne-Gnome-balance-bike-3-inch-wide-tires-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14094657/Airborne-Gnome-balance-bike-3-inch-wide-tires-2-e1634219244594.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1905\" height=\"1044\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14094657/Airborne-Gnome-balance-bike-3-inch-wide-tires-2-e1634219244594.png 1905w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14094657/Airborne-Gnome-balance-bike-3-inch-wide-tires-2-e1634219244594-120x66.png 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14094657/Airborne-Gnome-balance-bike-3-inch-wide-tires-2-e1634219244594-297x163.png 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14094657/Airborne-Gnome-balance-bike-3-inch-wide-tires-2-e1634219244594-768x421.png 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14094657/Airborne-Gnome-balance-bike-3-inch-wide-tires-2-e1634219244594-800x438.png 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14094657/Airborne-Gnome-balance-bike-3-inch-wide-tires-2-e1634219244594-1536x842.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1905px) 100vw, 1905px\"></a></p><p>If you’re more of a mountain biker and want your toddler to be developing better awareness on the trails, the three-inch wide tires on the <a href=\"https://airbornebicycles.com/products/gnome-balance-bike\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Airborne Gnome</a> make this balance bike the most mountain bike-y of the bunch.

But, if you have a kid with special needs, it’s ability to be setup as a trike or quad could be a game changer!&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2018/11/29/monkey-cycle-is-a-balance-bike-trike-pedal-bike-more-to-grow-with-your-kid/\">Read more about it here.</a></p><ul><li>Material: Aluminum</li><li>Weight: 7.9 lbs</li><li>Wheel size: 12”</li><li>MSRP: $399-$499 (depending on the kit that you want)</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Super versatile, has disc brakes.<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Currently back ordered, expensive<br></p><div id=\"attachment_248152\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-6.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-248152\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-6.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-6-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-6-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-6-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-6-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-6-696x465.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-6-1068x713.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-6-629x420.jpg 629w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-248152\">c. Specialized</p></div><h2>Buyer’s Guide for Balance Bikes</h2><p><strong>Check your kiddo’s inseam</strong>: On average, a 12” balance bike will usually fit kids ranging from 18 months to five years old, or inseam lengths around 12 to 20 inches. If their inseam is shorter than that, they’re likely still too young for a balance bike. Taller than that? You may need to look for a 14” or even 16” balance bike. And most 12” bikes have a weight limit of around 60 pounds. Especially if your child is on the larger/older side when you start shopping for a balance bike, look for a bike that can grow a bit with your child—if he or she is on the cusp of needing a 14” bike, go for the 14” rather than the 12”.</p><p><strong>Consider weight</strong>: No, you don’t need a sub-five pound balance bike. But if you are lugging it around for your child often (to and from the playground, all over the house) or if your child is using it in a way that has him or her picking it up often (kiddie ‘cross, anyone?), then weight is a factor. Strider offers a Pro 12″ model with an aluminum frame that’s just 5.6lb for $160, so only a bit more expensive than their Sport model, but more than a pound lighter…and it comes with a number plate!</p><p><strong>Spin the wheels</strong>: All of the bikes on this list have wheels that spin smoothly, but if you’re buying from a department store or buying used, do a quick wheel spin and make sure there are no weird hitches or wobbles. They should spin freely and smoothly, and keep spinning for a while. If they come to a stop after just a few revolutions, the bearings are probably worn out. (The same is true when buying one at a bike shop—it’s unlikely you’ll have a problem, but it’s worth a quick test.)</p><p><strong>Types of tires and wheels</strong>: While there aren’t many components to a balance bike, the tires and wheels make a big difference to ease of ride. Don’t get plastic tires: pneumatic is more comfortable and better performing than solid rubber, but slightly higher maintenance. Strider uses a ‘foam rubber’ to make maintenance even easier while still offering smooth ride quality. And check the bearings in the wheels as well: Strider (and most other bike-specific companies) uses sealed cartridge bearings in their wheels, not loose balls like what’s found on some cheap department store bikes. Not only will they run smoother for much, much longer, they’re likely never going to need to be replaced in your kid’s lifetime of use.</p><div id=\"attachment_199193\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/strider-14x-kids-balance-to-pedal-bike-review01.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-199193\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/strider-14x-kids-balance-to-pedal-bike-review01.jpg\" alt=\"Strider 14x balance bike converts to pedal bike as your kid grows\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/strider-14x-kids-balance-to-pedal-bike-review01.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/strider-14x-kids-balance-to-pedal-bike-review01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/strider-14x-kids-balance-to-pedal-bike-review01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/strider-14x-kids-balance-to-pedal-bike-review01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/strider-14x-kids-balance-to-pedal-bike-review01-600x450.jpg 600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/strider-14x-kids-balance-to-pedal-bike-review01-80x60.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/strider-14x-kids-balance-to-pedal-bike-review01-265x198.jpg 265w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/strider-14x-kids-balance-to-pedal-bike-review01-696x522.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/strider-14x-kids-balance-to-pedal-bike-review01-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/strider-14x-kids-balance-to-pedal-bike-review01-560x420.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-199193\">Strider 14x balance bike converts to pedal bike as your kid grows</p></div><h2>Frequently Asked Questions about Balance Bikes</h2><p><strong>Why do I need a balance bike rather than just getting my kid a bike with training wheels or a tricycle?</strong><br>Think about riding your bike: pedaling is the easy part, right? The balance and the ability to lean into corners is where the real challenge happens. Picture a tricycle compared to a balance bike: On a tricycle or a bike with training wheels, you’re stuck in a perfectly upright position, unable to lean the bike into a corner as you turn the handlebar. It’s completely unnatural at best, and unsafe at worst as it’s easy to tip over the wrong way if you take a corner too fast.</p><p>A balance bike teaches kids how to stay balanced (duh) and how to use their body weight to move the bike around obstacles. Want proof? Check out Strider World Championships to see these tiny shredders taking corners at ridiculous speeds. Lastly, think back to your own childhood: Riding a bike with training wheels just plain sucks. It wobbles and it’s slow, and it actually slows down a kid’s ability to learn how to ride a bike!</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iG4rJaTaE0Y?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><p><strong>When can my kid start riding a balance bike?</strong><br>There’s no exact age, but many can start playing with a balance bike on soft surfaces once they’re walking relatively confidently. It may take a while before they get good at riding, but having the bike around to play with and to allow them to get curious is a good way to ease them into a love of biking. So yes, order now if you have a newborn you’re hoping grows into a tiny shredder!

These bikes have a long shelf life, and can easily be passed on to nieces, nephews, and friends…probably even grandkids! We’ve passed the same bike around to five different families and it’s still making the rounds.</p><p><strong>How long will my child be able to use the balance bike?</strong><br>Usually until around six years old, though if you start them early, they’ll likely graduate to a pedal bike long before then. Ultimately, a child won’t use a balance bike for too long before they’re ready to shred on their first two-wheeler! Note: You’ll have a much longer use time if you buy one like the Strider 14” or Monkey Cycle that’s convertible to a pedal bike.</p><div id=\"attachment_205800\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MonkeyCycle-adjustable-kids-bike_8-in1-childrens-bike-that-grows-from-balance-bike-to-pedal-bike_tricycles-Tadpole-Pedal-Trike.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-205800\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MonkeyCycle-adjustable-kids-bike_8-in1-childrens-bike-that-grows-from-balance-bike-to-pedal-bike_tricycles-Tadpole-Pedal-Trike.jpg\" alt=\"MonkeyCycle adjustable kid's bike, 8-in-1 children's bike that grows from balance bike to pedal bike\" width=\"1880\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MonkeyCycle-adjustable-kids-bike_8-in1-childrens-bike-that-grows-from-balance-bike-to-pedal-bike_tricycles-Tadpole-Pedal-Trike.jpg 1880w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MonkeyCycle-adjustable-kids-bike_8-in1-childrens-bike-that-grows-from-balance-bike-to-pedal-bike_tricycles-Tadpole-Pedal-Trike-120x45.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MonkeyCycle-adjustable-kids-bike_8-in1-childrens-bike-that-grows-from-balance-bike-to-pedal-bike_tricycles-Tadpole-Pedal-Trike-297x111.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MonkeyCycle-adjustable-kids-bike_8-in1-childrens-bike-that-grows-from-balance-bike-to-pedal-bike_tricycles-Tadpole-Pedal-Trike-768x286.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MonkeyCycle-adjustable-kids-bike_8-in1-childrens-bike-that-grows-from-balance-bike-to-pedal-bike_tricycles-Tadpole-Pedal-Trike-600x223.jpg 600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MonkeyCycle-adjustable-kids-bike_8-in1-childrens-bike-that-grows-from-balance-bike-to-pedal-bike_tricycles-Tadpole-Pedal-Trike-696x259.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MonkeyCycle-adjustable-kids-bike_8-in1-childrens-bike-that-grows-from-balance-bike-to-pedal-bike_tricycles-Tadpole-Pedal-Trike-1068x398.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MonkeyCycle-adjustable-kids-bike_8-in1-childrens-bike-that-grows-from-balance-bike-to-pedal-bike_tricycles-Tadpole-Pedal-Trike-1128x420.jpg 1128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1880px) 100vw, 1880px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-205800\">Monkey Cycle adjusts into a pedal bike as your kiddo outgrows the balance bike, but also a trike that’s great for special needs children. c.

The downside is that pedal bikes are typically taller, so you may not be able to get the seat low enough for younger kids to easily put their feet flat on the ground and scoot along…and that’s important. They should be able to easily sit on the bike’s saddle with their feet flat on the ground.</p><div id=\"attachment_248154\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-8.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-248154\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-8.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-8-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-8-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-8-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-8-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-8-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Specialized-Hotwalk-Carbon-lightest-bike-yet-kids-strider-balance-bike-ultra-light-8-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-248154\">Specialized Hotwalk Carbon lightest bike yet kids strider balance bike ultra light. c.

As we mentioned above, using a balance bike teaches your child more body awareness and helps them learn to shift weight, lean into corners, and smoothly coast in a way that training wheels simply cannot.</p><p>The actual pedaling part of riding a bike isn’t what’s hard to learn…it’s trying to learn pedaling and balancing at the same time that trips kids up and gets them frustrated. Teaching them the balancing and handling part first makes it super easy for them to add the pedaling part later. And by “later” we don’t mean long…we’ve seen some 2-year-olds master it in a week and hop on a regular pedal bike and go!</p></section></div>","author":"Molly Hurford","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"a39fb7d90a3fa924d4ca8415573943358664f691c420afb7bbc52d4d0d52bbdc","category":"Cycling"}
