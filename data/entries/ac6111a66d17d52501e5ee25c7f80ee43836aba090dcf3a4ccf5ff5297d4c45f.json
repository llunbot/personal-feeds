Qualcomm is leading the charge in mid-2024 with its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-looks-like-the-windows-worlds-answer-to-apple-silicon/\">Snapdragon X Elite</a> and a new CPU architecture called Oryon. And Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-make-arm-based-pc-chips-major-new-challenge-intel-2023-10-23/\">reported earlier this week</a> that Nvidia and AMD are targeting a 2025 release window for their own Arm chips for Windows PCs.</p>\n<p>If these companies successfully get their chips into PCs, it would mostly come at Intel's expense. But Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger doesn't seem worried about it yet, as he said on the company's most recent earnings call (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4644217-intel-corporation-intc-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript\">via Seeking Alpha</a>).</p>\n<p>\"Arm and Windows client alternatives, generally, they've been relegated to pretty insignificant roles in the PC business,\" said Gelsinger. \"And we take all competition seriously. But I think history as our guide here, we don't see these potentially being all that significant overall. Our momentum is strong. We have a strong roadmap.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979409#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979409&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ac6111a66d17d52501e5ee25c7f80ee43836aba090dcf3a4ccf5ff5297d4c45f","category":"Tech"}
