Last year, Apple offered U.S. students <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/apple-launches-2023-back-to-school-promotion/\">up to $150</a> when purchasing a Mac and up to $100 when purchasing an ‌iPad‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple actually began advertising its Back to School sale on social networks <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/04/apple-back-to-school-2024-sale-soon/\">in early June</a>, with some Instagram users seeing an ad promoting Macs with discounts to college and university students.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ad depicted a Back to School image with the following text: \"Buy Mac for university or college with education savings. Plus get a gift card for up to $200.\" The screenshot of the ad was from a Canadian user, and that price point suggests we will see the same $150 discount in the United States that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/apple-launches-2023-back-to-school-promotion/\">provided last year</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-ad-back-to-school.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"1104\" />\r<br />\nClicking on the ad redirected to Apple's education website, but the ad seems to have gone up early as there has been no sign of a Back to School promotion as of yet. Last year's back to school sale began on Monday, June 5. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/back-to-school-2024-launching-this-week/\">Apple's 2024 Back to School Sale Launching This Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-2024-back-to-school-sale-launching-this-week.2429448/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d2461da160432da68196fa4756767724ff21ac2d04e1df1451ecfde3ea653689","category":"Apple"}
