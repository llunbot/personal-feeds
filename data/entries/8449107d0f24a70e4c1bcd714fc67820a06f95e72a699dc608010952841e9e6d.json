I know that’s a little tricky to say, but if you are actually looking for an ebike that’s just as much fun to ride and as versatile as a regular pedal-powered all-rounder trail-shredding mountain bike, the new Neuron:ON is worth a closer look. With more travel and slightly slacker geometry than the standard Neuron, the Neuron:ON ebike is more capable, more playful, and will help carry you through bigger adventures with a powerful Bosch eMTB powertrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Neuron:ON CF carbon all-mountain ebike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_post-ride.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_post-ride-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Neuron:ON CF lightweight 140mm carbon all-mountain ebike, trail eMTB, muddy post ride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_post-ride-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_post-ride-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_post-ride-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_post-ride-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_post-ride-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_post-ride-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_post-ride.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption><em>photo by Cory Benson, c.

While the new frame material is the most obvious outward change, I think it is the extra travel that really brings the new Neuron:ON CF into its own, giving it just enough more to edge firmly into the heart of the Trail category where you can literally ride this ebike wherever your own technical skills can take you. For me, it became a playful light all-mountain ebike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-carbon-frame.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"760\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-carbon-frame-800x760.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Neuron:ON CF lightweight 140mm carbon all-mountain ebike, trail eMTB, carbon detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-carbon-frame-800x760.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-carbon-frame-297x282.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-carbon-frame-120x114.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-carbon-frame-768x730.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-carbon-frame-1536x1459.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-carbon-frame.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next is that new full carbon frame. The new ebike gets cleaner looks for sure, but Canyon managed to save quite a bit of weight here. Canyon claims they were able to shed almost 2kg, while increasing frame strength. And even with longer travel, the lowest spec complete CF carbon eMTB weighs a claimed 1.7kg less than the remaining shorter-travel alloy model. Plus, not with a stiffer AND lighter platform, it really can go anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Progressive geometry boost</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-vs-old-model.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-vs-old-model-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Neuron:ON CF lightweight 140mm carbon all-mountain ebike, trail eMTB, old vs. new\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-vs-old-model-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-vs-old-model-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-vs-old-model-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-vs-old-model-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-vs-old-model-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-vs-old-model-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-vs-old-model-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_new-vs-old-model.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>new 2023 Canyon Neuron:ON CF (<em>front</em>) vs. old alloy Neuron:ON (<em>blue</em>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, more progressive enduro-inspired geometry with a full two-degree slacker head tube now at 65.5° and up to 35mm longer reach depending on size (but lower standover). It’s also all 29er now with ten-millimeter longer chainstays at 450mm and slightly lower bottom bracket height for more stability in rougher terrain. But there’s now just four S-XL sizes (no longer an XS). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_progressive-geometry.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_progressive-geometry-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon NeuronON CF lightweight 140mm carbon all-mountain ebike, trail eMTB, new geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_progressive-geometry-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_progressive-geometry-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_progressive-geometry-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_progressive-geometry-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_progressive-geometry-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_progressive-geometry.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with more travel and a stiffer chassis, the progressive geometry shift really upgrades the capability of this ebike.

The new Neuron:ON CF jumps to the fourth-generation Bosch Performance Line CX motor which puts out industry-leading torque. Shimano vs. Bosch is often a personal preference, but there’s no denying that this Bosch motor really gets this eMTB going when you put power into the pedals. Paired with either 625Wh or 750Wh internal Bosch Powertube batteries, you get also get bigger long-lasting pedal-assist support for big rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_top-tube-display.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_top-tube-display-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Neuron:ON CF lightweight 140mm carbon all-mountain ebike, trail eMTB, Bosch toptube LED display\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_top-tube-display-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_top-tube-display-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_top-tube-display-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_top-tube-display-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_top-tube-display-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_top-tube-display-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_top-tube-display.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption>photo by Cory Benson, c.

After that, tracking subscriptions cost 5€ per month or 40€ per year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_photo-by-Markus-Greber_cornering.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_photo-by-Markus-Greber_cornering-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Neuron:ON CF lightweight 140mm carbon all-mountain ebike, trail eMTB, photo by Markus Greber, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_photo-by-Markus-Greber_cornering-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_photo-by-Markus-Greber_cornering-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_photo-by-Markus-Greber_cornering-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_photo-by-Markus-Greber_cornering-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_photo-by-Markus-Greber_cornering-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_photo-by-Markus-Greber_cornering-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_photo-by-Markus-Greber_cornering.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption><em>photo by Markus Greber</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon Neuron:ON CF ebike – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_CF7.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_CF7-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Neuron:ON CF lightweight 140mm carbon all-mountain ebike, trail eMTB, CF7\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_CF7-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_CF7-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_CF7-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_CF7-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_CF7-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Canyon-NeuronON-CF-lightweight-140mm-carbon-all-mountain-ebike_trail-eMTB_CF7.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>2023 Canyon Neuron:ON CF 7</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The most affordable of the new carbon ebikes is the 4800€ Canyon Neuron:ON CF 7 that comes with RockShox suspension, a Shimano Deore drivetrain, and the smaller, but also lighter 625Wh battery.
