It has built a series of \"<a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g43369019/dodge-charger-challenger-last-call-gallery/\">last call</a>\" versions of the Charger and Challenger, limited editions with callback paint colors and retro liveries that refer to muscle-packed Dodges of old. Now it really is getting ready to end the car design and is doing so with a bang, via the 2023 Challenger SRT Demon 170, a production car so fast it can even show a Tesla Model S Plaid a clean pair of shoes with a 1.66 second 0-60 mph time.</p>\n<p>Dodge's engineers have performed quite a bit of work under that bulging \"Air-Grabber\" hood compared to lesser Demons. There's a new supercharger with a larger throttle body and a pulley that increases boost pressure by 40 percent compared to the Challenger Hellcat Redeye Widebody.</p>\n<p>You'll get the best results by feeding it E85 (a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline); on this fuel, the Demon 170 generates an enormous 1,025 hp (764 kW) and 945 lb-ft (1,281 Nm). On the more common E10 fuel, the engine will generate a slightly milder 900 hp (671 kW) and 810 lb-ft (1,098 Nm).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925572#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925572&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
