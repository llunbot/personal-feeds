Last year's OnePlus 8 Pro came with a 30W \"Warp\" charger, and this year's OnePlus 9 Pro will support 50W wireless charging speeds thanks to the next-generation Warp charger, which is capable of charging a dead phone to full power in 43 minutes – faster than an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> plugged directly into a 20W charger.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nApple's longtime goal has been an ‌iPhone‌ with no external ports or buttons for a clean, streamlined device, but until it can improve the maximum 15W charging speed of ‌MagSafe‌ or come up with another wireless alternative, that's unlikely to happen. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2016, Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/02/05/apple-energous-possible-partnership-speculation/\">rumored</a> to be partnering with Energous to deliver a \"true wireless charging\" solution, but nothing has come from it so far. Apple is still believed to be researching new wireless charging technologies, and with the advent of ‌MagSafe‌ on ‌iPhone 12‌ models, the company is clearly still interested in innovating ways to power devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPhone 13‌ and future iPhones are expected to continue to use Lightning ports with the option of ‌MagSafe‌ until a more viable wireless charging solution comes along that allows for a portless ‌iPhone‌ design.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-pixel/\">Google Pixel</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/google-pixel-to-get-23w-wireless-charging/\">Google Pixel 6 Rumored to Support 23W Wireless Charging, Beating iPhone 12's MagSafe</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-pixel-6-rumored-to-support-23w-wireless-charging-beating-iphone-12s-magsafe.2309395/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gIC7ymOAhpg:7ih_IdAqOSc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gIC7ymOAhpg:7ih_IdAqOSc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/gIC7ymOAhpg\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ff465d9fa84235259add9d32679b2b2969908fd4fb0a819cc55df7e8c19cb14d","category":"Apple"}
