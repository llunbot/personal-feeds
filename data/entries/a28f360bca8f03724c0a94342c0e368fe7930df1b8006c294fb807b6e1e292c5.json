Offering 180mm of rear-wheel travel, the Shore is a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-high-pivot-mountain-bike/\">high-pivot</a> enduro mountain bike with a Horst-link suspension design.</p>\n<p>Built around an aluminium frame, the Shore features an excellent and progressive geometry with a generous 480mm reach, 63-degree head tube angle and 445mm chainstays on our size large.</p>\n<p>Norco is one of the only brands to vary chainstay lengths across its range. Considering its weight, the Shore climbs well despite the MaxxGrip compound on the Maxxis DoubleDown casing tyres, which we swapped to a MaxxTerra.</p>\n<p>The Shore is a very comfortable bike to ride over rough terrain and is also incredibly predictable. Thanks to the ideal geometry, you can weight the front wheel confidently and it feels super-composed, both at speed and in technical sections.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/norco-shore-2-review/\">Read our full Norco Shore 2 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Canyon Strive CFR</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Canyon Strive is a race-bred enduro bike with stage-ready performance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£5,999 / $7,299 / €6,299</li>\n<li>Chassis provides stability at high speeds</li>\n<li>Race bike feel with high performance potential</li>\n<li>Suspension can feel harsh at low speeds</li>\n</ul><p>The Strive CFR is Canyon’s race bike offering 170mm of travel and 29in wheels.</p>\n<p>The Strive is well-specced compared to its contemporaries, with a Shimano XTR drivetrain and brakes paired with a Race Face Next RS crankset.</p>\n<p>The Shapeshifter system allows for better on-the-fly adjustment to the bike’s geometry and presents a marked improvement on the previous model.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/canyon-strive-cfr-review/\">Read our full Canyon Strive CFR review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Cube Stereo 170 SL 29</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cube’s new Stereo 170 SL 29 was a ridiculous amount of fun to ride and offers a seriously killer spec for the cash.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dan Milner/MBUK</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£4,699 / €3,999 as tested</li>\n<li>Incredible value for money with Fox Factory suspension and RaceFace finishing kit</li>\n<li>Well balanced and adjustable geometry</li>\n<li>A fun, lively and involving ride</li>\n</ul><p>A real return to form from Cube with a light and lively handling bike that gave us massive grins while riding it.

The revamped suspension brings 160mm of travel to the rear of the bike, thanks to a four-bar Horst link platform.</p>\n<p>This delivers a more dynamic ride compared to the previous version of the Mega, with plenty of support too. The shorter chainstays and longer front end of the new geometry, paired with the updated suspension, give the confidence to tackle rocky terrain and steeper sections.</p>\n<p>The spec is top-class on the Mega, but the tyres and saddle could be swapped for a better ride. The saddle proved uncomfortable on longer climbs in testing and the tyres weren’t the fastest rolling.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/nukeproof-mega-290-carbon-rs-review/\">Read our full Nukeproof Mega 290 Carbon RS review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Specialized Enduro Comp Carbon 29</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Specialized has made one of the smoothest enduro bikes around.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dan Milner</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£5,000 / $4,510 / AU$6,800 / €4,999 as tested</li>\n<li>Category-defining bike that has had a refresh for 2020</li>\n<li>Super-smooth, bump-eating suspension</li>\n<li>Perhaps not the best-value bike around</li>\n</ul><p>The Enduro and ‘enduro’ riding go hand in hand, with Specialized’s long-travel bike almost defining the genre over the last decade.

This, paired with the long front end, makes for a lively ride, but it does affect balance while cornering.</p>\n<p>Having said this, the Status feels like a solid bruiser from the off and is a seriously fun, exciting bike – especially given its lower price point.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/2021-specialized-status-160-review/\">Read our full Specialized Status 160 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Trek Slash 8</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Trek Slash 8 packs a serious punch considering its price.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£3,450 / $4,200 / AU$6,300 / €3,699 as tested</li>\n<li>Our 2021 Enduro Bike of the Year</li>\n<li>Natural-feeling geometry and great finishing kit</li>\n<li>Seriously impressive suspension</li>\n</ul><p>From a playing field that felt the most level it had ever been, the Trek Slash 8 was crowned our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/boty-2021-trail-enduro-winners/\">2021 Enduro Bike of the Year</a>, so we’ll happily recommend it to any rider looking for a new enduro bike.</p>\n<p>The Slash 8 hits the sweet spot between delivering a fun and lively ride and being calm and composed on the rowdiest terrain.

On descents, the bike is reactive without feeling harsh when things get bumpier, even if it isn’t the most gravity-orientated machine.</p>\n<p>This makes the Vitus a great all-rounder, whether clocking up big miles, at the bike park or even between the tape at enduro-style events.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/vitus-sommet-29-crx-review/\">Read our full Vitus Sommet 29 CRX review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Whyte G-180 RS MX</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 2022 Whyte G-180 enduro mountain bike comes with this mullet build.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£4,200 as tested</li>\n<li>Plenty of confidence, grip and fun</li>\n<li>Excellent spec for the money</li>\n<li>Well-balanced suspension that is livelier than the amount of travel might suggest</li>\n</ul><p>The Whyte G-180 RS MX is an alloy-framed bike with a mullet build.

This capable pairing makes for a bike that can deal with rowdy trails, but it still has plenty of pop for mellower sections.</p>\n<p>While climbing, the comfortable seat position provides a roomy feel, and even with the rear shock left open the suspension remains relatively calm, finding traction on loose surfaces.</p>\n<p>The Whyte might not be the fastest bike in certain sections but it carries momentum well and is worth considering if you’re after a big hitter that climbs well. It’s worth noting that it’s not available in a size small.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/whyte-g-180-rs-mx-review/\">Read our full Whyte G-180 RS MX review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Devinci Spartan HP GX</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Devinici’s Spartan has a 170mm front fork and 160mm at the rear.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Not available in UK / $6,149 / €6,249 as tested</li>\n<li>Impressive suspension</li>\n<li>Really well-specced for the asking price</li>\n<li>A capable descender</li>\n</ul><p>The Spartan HP is a bump-munching, race-ready, high-pivot enduro machine and the entry model we tested has a solid spec for the price.

The Spartan is sure-footed on tight and twisty trails, and it’s at home when ridden aggressively with intent. When pushed very hard, the Spartan can punish its rear wheel, though.

It’s a striking-looking enduro bike, with its hidden shock designed to lower the centre of gravity and a great paintjob. It’s available as a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29er</a> only.</p>\n<p>The high-pivot suspension design incorporates Cannondale’s Ai asymmetric rear triangle to increase frame clearance. There’s an idler wheel in the chainline to help prevent the kickback that can come with high-pivot kinematics.</p>\n<p>Spec-wise, there’s Shimano Deore, which despite being low-spec for the Jekyll 2’s price, worked just fine. Cannondale specs 165mm cranks to reduce pedal strikes. Suspension is provided by a 170mm RockShox Zeb Select fork and a Fox Float DPX2 Performance shock with 165mm of travel. We had issues with wheel build quality though.</p>\n<p>We really liked the forward seated position and absence of bob when climbing.

The SB165’s rear end is progressive and absorbs bumps quickly, while it provides a massive amount of grip, meaning even poor line choices don’t pose problems for the rider. The geometry, with its slack head angle, enhances the confidence-inspiring performance of the suspension, but longer chainstays might further improve its stability.</p>\n<p>Despite the Fox Factory DHX2 coil-sprung 165mm rear shock, ascending on the Yeti is easier than expected. The suspension on the bike does make it feel slower on the flat, but this is offset by the bike’s low weight.</p>\n<p>You can thank the fully carbon frame for that. Internal cable routing gives this Yeti a minimal-fuss aesthetic. This is a great look – and helps the bike look as fast as it rides – but one that can lead to extra hassle in the work stand.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/yeti-sb165-long-term-review/\">Read our long-term review of the Yeti SB165</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>YT Capra Shred 27.5</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The YT Capra Shred uses the same frame as the standard Capra, but comes with a burlier build.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£3,825 as tested</li>\n<li>Low-slung, planted suspension</li>\n<li>Solid feel over rougher terrain</li>\n<li>The kit isn’t the flashiest, but everything works well</li>\n</ul><p>The YT Capra Shred 27.5 has sleek aluminium tubing that’s pleasing to the eye and is built for ripping around bike parks and local trails.

It’s a bit chicken and egg, but the race genre and the bike genre have pushed each other’s limits, and driven development of bike tech far beyond the confines of the course tapes.</p>\n<p>Enduro bikes sit in the middle ground between <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downhill-mountain-bikes/\">downhill bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/enduro-vs-trail-bikes/\">trail bikes</a>. Like a DH bike, they’re designed to get down hills as fast as possible, tackling chunky rock gardens, matted root beds, big drops and canyon-like gaps, doing it all with a little less <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">suspension travel</a>.</p>\n<p>However, like the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">best trail mountain bikes</a>, they’re also designed to be pedalled back up; so rather than pushing to the top of the track, they can be ridden up thanks to more suitable geometry, wider gear ranges and lighter builds than a DH bike.</p>\n<p>As such, they’re slightly less capable downhill than a DH bike, but far more capable up, and more capable down but less capable up than a trail bike… got it?!</p>\n<h2>How much travel does an enduro bike have?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s no hard and fast definition of how much travel an enduro bike should have.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While there’s no set definition of travel that defines an enduro bike, the majority have between 150 and 170mm of suspension front and rear. Some 27.5in-wheel enduro bikes may push travel a touch higher and there are a few with a little less at the rear – usually 29in bikes.</p>\n<p>Expect to see the burliest single-crown suspension forks a brand has to offer with stanchion diameters varying from 35mm to 38mm. They’re built to be stiff, smooth and supportive, with higher-end models sporting plenty of adjustability.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rear shocks on enduro bikes will feature a ‘piggyback’ chamber.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Rear shocks, especially when you’re buying bikes from the mid-range up, will have a ‘piggyback’ design.</p>\n<p>This is an additional chamber connected to one end of the shock that allows for additional oil flow through the shock. This, then, allows for better temperature management and more consistency on long descents (you’ll be surprised by how warm a shock can get in use).</p>\n<p>How the bikes use that suspension travel will vary too. Some bikes have incredibly plush suspension that totally insulates you from the trail, leading to an incredibly planted feel that’s fast on steep and rough terrain.</p>\n<p>But with all that smoothness comes more pedal-induced movement, so these bikes can often feel sluggish on climbs and flatter tracks – you’ll be reaching for a lockout lever much sooner.</p>\n<p>However, some bikes will have a more pedal-friendly suspension, which will make the uphills much easier and the flatter tracks more fun. You may lose some of that buttery feeling when you’re going flat-out over rocks and roots, though.</p>\n<h2>Enduro bike geometry – what’s that about?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Long and slack geometry helps to boost confidence in tricky terrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The latest enduro bikes have <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/spoke-tension-is-long-slack-and-low-geometry-always-better-our-tech-experts-give-us-their-angle/\">long, low and slack geometry</a>. This means long front centres (and reach measurements), slack head angles and low bottom brackets. This makes them feel super-confident on steep hillsides because there’s less chance of you flipping over the handlebars, and it helps you better manage weight and grip between the tyres.</p>\n<p>Longer geometry can make the bikes a little slower to react to inputs, and sometimes you may find you need to re-address your riding technique to get the most agility out of them, but these bikes have descending speed at the forefront of their design.</p>","author":"Tom Marvin","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a28f360bca8f03724c0a94342c0e368fe7930df1b8006c294fb807b6e1e292c5","category":"Cycling"}
