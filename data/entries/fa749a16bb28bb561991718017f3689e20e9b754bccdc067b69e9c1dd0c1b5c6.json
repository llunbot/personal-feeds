Hundreds of employees from international retail stores have been flying into Cupertino for multi-day Vision Pro training sessions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple held similar training sessions ahead of when the Vision Pro launched in the United States, with employees learning how to provide customer demonstrations and answer customer questions. An exact launch date for the Vision Pro hasn't yet been announced, but it is expected to expand to additional countries after WWDC. This year's Worldwide Developers Conference is set to take place from June 10 to June 14.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEmployees from stores in Australia, China, Germany, France, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore are attending the training sessions, so these are likely to be the first countries to get the Vision Pro after the United States.

International sales could bring a renewed wave of excitement over the device, but at $3,500 USD, the price is still prohibitive.
