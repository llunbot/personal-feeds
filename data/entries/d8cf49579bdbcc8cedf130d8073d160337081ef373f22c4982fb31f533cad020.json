Within days of Apple's announcement, they said, people had pointed out ways to avoid detection by editing the images slightly.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"It's allowing scanning of a personal private device without any probable cause for anything illegitimate being done,\" added another member of the group, Susan Landau, a professor of cybersecurity and policy at Tufts University. \"It's extraordinarily dangerous. It's dangerous for business, national security, for public safety and for privacy.\"</blockquote>The cybersecurity researchers said they had begun their study before Apple's announcement, and were publishing their findings now to inform the European Union of the dangers of its own similar plans.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has faced significant criticism from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/19/policy-groups-urge-apple-abandon-csam-scanning/\">privacy advocates</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/20/university-researchers-csam-dangerous/\">security researchers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/corellium-new-initiative-apple-csam-claims/\">cryptography experts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/security-researchers-alarmed-apple-csam-plans/\">academics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/18/german-politician-letter-tim-cook-csam-scanning/\">politicians</a>, and even <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/apple-employees-concerns-over-csam/\">employees within the company</a> for its decision to deploy the technology in a future update to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple initially endeavored to dispel misunderstandings and reassure users by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/09/apple-faq-csam-detection-messages-scanning/\">releasing</a> detailed information, sharing FAQs, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/apple-to-consider-csam-detection-per-country/\">various new documents</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/federighi-confusion-around-child-safety-details/\">interviews with company executives</a>, and more in order to allay concerns.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, when it became clear that this wasn't having the intended effect, Apple subsequently acknowledged the negative feedback and announced in September a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/03/apple-delaying-rollout-of-child-safety-features/\">delay to the rollout of the features</a> to give the company time to make \"improvements\" to the CSAM system, although it's not clear what they would involve and how they would address concerns. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has also said it would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/09/apple-faq-csam-detection-messages-scanning/\">refuse</a> demands by authoritarian governments to expand the image-detection system beyond pictures of children flagged by recognized databases of child sex abuse material, although it has not said that it would pull out of a market rather than obeying a court order.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/\">Apple privacy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-child-safety-features/\">Apple child safety features</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/15/cybersecurity-experts-criticize-apple-csam/\">Apple's Proposed Phone-Scanning Child Safety Features 'Invasive, Ineffective, and Dangerous,' Say Cybersecurity Researchers in New Study</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-proposed-phone-scanning-child-safety-features-invasive-ineffective-and-dangerous-say-cybersecurity-researchers-in-new-study.2317024/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5slWf6qAK8k:ouJ6CbXU1X0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5slWf6qAK8k:ouJ6CbXU1X0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/5slWf6qAK8k\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d8cf49579bdbcc8cedf130d8073d160337081ef373f22c4982fb31f533cad020","category":"Apple"}
