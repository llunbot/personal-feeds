But they immediately pivoted to the fact that safety is always their number 1 priority. So even making a light and well-ventilated helmet, it had to as safe as possible first.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_on-bike.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_on-bike.webp\" alt=\"POC Cularis mountain bike helmet is the Virginia Tech safest MTB helmet. lightweight, ventilated &amp; safe, side on bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_on-bike.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_on-bike-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_on-bike-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_on-bike-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_on-bike-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_on-bike-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_on-bike-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With my first look at this helmet, I didn’t immediately get the sense that it would be the safest in a crash of all other helmets that I have tested or even seen. It is truly an unassuming design. With smooth round curves – and classic POC styling – it doesn’t look aggressive or even look like it offers more coverage compared to other POC MTB lids like the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-pocs-tectal-race-spin-helmet-crave-sunglasses-and-joint-vpd-air-knee-pads/\" target=\"_blank\">Tectal</a> or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pocs-new-high-tech-kortal-race-mips-helmet-and-devour-sunglasses/\" target=\"_blank\">Kortal</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-safest-bike-helmets-from-Virginia-Tech-Helmet-Ratings-tests.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-safest-bike-helmets-from-Virginia-Tech-Helmet-Ratings-tests.webp\" alt=\"The current safest bicycle helmets in Virginia Tech Helmet Ratings laboratory testing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-safest-bike-helmets-from-Virginia-Tech-Helmet-Ratings-tests.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-safest-bike-helmets-from-Virginia-Tech-Helmet-Ratings-tests-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-safest-bike-helmets-from-Virginia-Tech-Helmet-Ratings-tests-1536x853.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-safest-bike-helmets-from-Virginia-Tech-Helmet-Ratings-tests-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-safest-bike-helmets-from-Virginia-Tech-Helmet-Ratings-tests-768x427.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Image/Virginia Tech Helmet Ratings)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sneak-peek-upcoming-poc-helmets-claim-virginia-tech-safest-road-mountain-titles/\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Tech Helmet Ratings lab results</a> back up POC’s claims of safety as a priority. Certainly, it seems that VT is testing the safety of helmets in a similar way to how POC optimizes their designs. Impacts against an angled plane in several different orientations that often result in glancing blows and rotational forces. But that feels like an authentic overlap, as both VT &amp; POC are trying to reproduce impacts more like those cyclists experience in a real-world crash – much different than the single drop on top of your head that dictates most current government minimal safety test standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Riding Review</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-enduro.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-enduro.webp\" alt=\"POC Cularis mountain bike helmet is the Virginia Tech safest MTB helmet. lightweight, ventilated &amp; safe, trail riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-enduro.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-enduro-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-enduro-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-enduro-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-enduro-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-enduro-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-enduro-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, I’ve managed not to crash in either the new Cularis yet, so I can’t personally attest to its safety. So I will stick with the subjective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very light-feeling helmet on my head. And once you put it on, it does feel like it wraps the head quite well. It is not NTA certified for the high-speed ebikes that require licensing, so it sticks to the conventional impact testing area. But coverage of the helmet feels good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is really most noticeable is the light and airy feel because of all of those open vents.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Excellent Airflow for Max Cooling</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_inside-details.webp\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_inside-details.webp\" alt=\"POC Cularis mountain bike helmet is the Virginia Tech safest MTB helmet. lightweight, ventilated &amp; safe, MIPS Air Node inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_inside-details.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_inside-details-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_inside-details-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_inside-details-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_inside-details-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_inside-details-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_inside-details-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_inside-details-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I sweat a lot year-round, so ventilation is key for a helmet for me to remain comfortable. But even then, I sweat without the helmet, so sweat management and plenty of airflow for effective evaporative cooling are really the key factors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The POC Cularis does a great job with this compared to other trail bike helmets – apparently fueled by extensive CFD airflow analysis. It’s been especially noticeable in some recent cold rides where I sweat quite a bit on extended sunny climbs, and then on the long shaded high-speed descents, the amount of airflow over my sweaty brow is shockingly effective. Much more noticeable than most similar helmets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-left.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-left.webp\" alt=\"POC Cularis mountain bike helmet is the Virginia Tech safest MTB helmet. lightweight, ventilated &amp; safe, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-left.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-left-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-left-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-left-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-left-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-left-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_riding-left-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cularis holds just a little sweat in the MIPS Air Node front pad, but not an unreasonable amount. Sweat seems to move away from my face and only down the straps or across my temples, meaning it doesn’t drip down my glasses. A MIPS liner is often the limitation to front ventilation across your brow, as they require a solid plastic strip for the rotational protection. Here it is thin enough to not be a significant issue. But I still think this is a place where there is more room for improvement between MIPS &amp; helmet brands to make these front pads more air-permeable/breathable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, the new POC Cularis feels like the kind of mountain bike helmet that you put on and just forget about. Which I feel like is one of the highest compliments I can give for any cycling product. You use it, benefit from it, but don’t have to think about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_rear-detail.jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/POC-Cularis-mountain-bike-helmet_safest-MTB-helmet_lightweight-ventilated-safe_rear-detail.jpg.webp\" alt=\"POC Cularis mountain bike helmet is the Virginia Tech safest MTB helmet. lightweight, ventilated &amp;
