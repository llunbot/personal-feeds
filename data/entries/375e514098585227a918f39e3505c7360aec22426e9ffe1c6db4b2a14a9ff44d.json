Users of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/hammerhead-karoo-3-gps-bike-computer-review\">Hammerhead Karoo</a>, which like Zipp wheels is also a SRAM product, get even more data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pressure sensor module weighs around 15g, which Zipp has had to balance by adding weight at the opposite side of the wheel. Nevertheless, the 353 NSW is Zipp’s lightest wheelset at a claimed 1,310g. Thanks to a revised carbon layup for the 25mm internal/29.5mm external width <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\">hookless</a> design, Zipp also claims that its rim’s impact strength is 16% greater.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 353 NSW, which last <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/zipp-353-nsw-stronger-faster-lighter-and-tubeless-us-brand-s-most-versatile-wheels-ever\">had an overhaul</a> in 2021, has an undulating 35/40mm deep section. It’s aero optimised for 30mm tyres, with Zipp and Goodyear partnering to provide suitable options and recommending the Goodyear Vector R Z30 NSW, although Zipp says you can use the 353 NSW wheels with tyres from 29mm to 35mm wide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 353 NSW wheelset rolls on a new, 30g lighter ZR1 SL hub with ceramic bearings included in wheels sold aftermarket and 66 points of engagement from a 2×3 pawl freehub configuration, where one of two sets of three pawls are engaged at any one time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zipp says that the 353 NSW is not approved for gravel riding, so you’ll need to stick to tarmac. The wheelset is priced at £3,500 / $4,300 / €3,900 / AU$7,390.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+1\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'celebrate the world's most beautiful sport, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-1-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why would you want an integrated tyre pressure sensor?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"644\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_303SW-sensore-macro-wide-970x644.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_303SW-sensore-macro-wide-970x644.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_303SW-sensore-macro-wide-300x199.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_303SW-sensore-macro-wide-768x510.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_303SW-sensore-macro-wide-1536x1020.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_303SW-sensore-macro-wide-2048x1361.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_303SW-sensore-macro-wide-750x498.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_303SW-sensore-macro-wide-1140x757.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_303SW-sensore-macro-wide-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_303SW-sensore-macro-wide-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_303SW-sensore-macro-wide-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Zipp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting ready to ride usually means either digging out the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-track-pumps\">track pump</a> to check tyre pressure or, for the hasty, pinching a tyre to make sure that it feels more-or-less at the right pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new wheel sensor, you preset your own acceptable pressure range in the AXS app. Then you just need to bounce or shake the wheel to wake the system and an LED on the rim will flash green if your tyre pressure is within range, flash red if it’s below your preset range or flash red at a faster rate if pressure is above the target range. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zipp reckons that this makes getting ready to roll much easier. You’ll also get a reading on your cycling computer and in the AXS app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’re riding, the pressure sensor means that you’ll get real-time info on your tyre pressure, can see if it changes during a ride and will be forewarned if a slow flat is about to dump you by the wayside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should the worst happen, it also means that it’s much easier to make sure that, having fixed the flat, you’ve reinflated to the correct pressure, as you’ll get a visual indication from the LEDs. Zipp reckons that, in particular, this makes using a CO2 cartridge much less hit-and-miss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another benefit cited by Zipp is the ability to correlate your <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-tyre-pressure\">tyre pressure</a> to your <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-tyres-wrong\">rolling efficiency</a>. The tyre sensor is much more neatly integrated into the wheels than the original TyreWiz tyre sensor, so there should be some aero benefits, which should make it more attractive to riders who are planning to spend money on pricey <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike-wheels\">aero wheels</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zipp’s integrated sensor is powered by a CR2032 coin cell and it reckons that riders will get around 400 days’ use before it needs to be changed. You can check battery status in the AXS app. The sensor needs to be used with Zipp’s own tubeless valve, which is designed with a small port in its side to allow sensor access. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can add <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-tubeless-sealant\">sealant </a>to a wheel through the valve with Zipp’s injector, which has a narrow bore tube to bypass the sensor port and is supplied with the wheels. Zipp says that the sensor is designed to be self-cleaning, clearing any sealant build-up when you inflate the tyre, but nevertheless if you don’t use the Zipp injector you can flood the sensor with sealant, potentially destroying it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sensor compatibility is also built into Zipp’s Smart Tube <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-inner-tubes\">TPU inner tube</a>, one of which is in the box with each wheel. You can buy one separately too, priced at £40  / $40 / €45 / AU$70. You can also run a standard inner tube in the wheels, but without pressure measurement. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

sensor is also integrated into the new 303 SW wheelset, which Zipp says is tough enough for gravel riders and which replaces the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/zipp-303-firecrest-tubeless-disc-a-brand-new-wheelset-with-new-ways-to-make-you-fast\">303 Firecrest</a>. It has a 1,440g claimed weight and Zipp says it’s more aero than its predecessor at low yaw angles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It reckons that the tyre pressure sensor will be particularly useful for gravel racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 303 SW’s 40mm deep profile comes with a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\">hookless</a> 25mm internal/33mm external width and, Zipp says, is designed for aero gains when run with tyres between 30mm and 35mm wide, although you can go as wide as 44mm. Zipp claims a 10% increase in impact strength over the previous generation 303 SW. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wheel’s ZR1 hubset has also had an upgrade, with new stainless steel bearings, which Zipp claims increase durability and corrosion resistance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zipp wheels with both the ZR1 and ZR1 SL hubs can be bought with Shimano HG11 or SRAM XDR freehubs and there’s a Campagnolo N3W freehub body available separately. You can also buy both the ZR1 and ZR1 SL hubs stand-alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zipp 303 SW wheelset is priced at £1,700 / $2,200 / €1,900 / AU$3,350.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>454 NSW and 858 NSW get an upgrade too</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_20250306-ZIPP-353NSW-and-303SW40299-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_20250306-ZIPP-353NSW-and-303SW40299-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_20250306-ZIPP-353NSW-and-303SW40299-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_20250306-ZIPP-353NSW-and-303SW40299-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_20250306-ZIPP-353NSW-and-303SW40299-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_20250306-ZIPP-353NSW-and-303SW40299-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_20250306-ZIPP-353NSW-and-303SW40299-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_20250306-ZIPP-353NSW-and-303SW40299-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_20250306-ZIPP-353NSW-and-303SW40299-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_20250306-ZIPP-353NSW-and-303SW40299-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Z_MY26_Studio_250326_CK_20250306-ZIPP-353NSW-and-303SW40299-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Zipp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The venerable 454 NSW and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/zipp-858-nsw-review\">858 NSW</a> wheelsets also get an upgrade to the ZR1 SL ceramic bearing hubset, so that the whole NSW line-up now uses the 304g SL hubs, although these two wheelsets don’t include the new pressure sensor.

It measures up at exactly 40mm on the wide rim, has Goodyears’ Dual Angle Bead, designed for easy set-up, and has a 120 tpi casing and claimed 440g weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Goodyear Vector R XPLR tyre has a list price of £90 / $90 / €100 / AU$155.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>40mm tyres look to be the new frontier in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-wider-tyres-faster\">wider-is-faster</a> tyre battle – if they’ll fit in your frame. The 303 XPLR rim is so wide that Zipp only recommends its use with a handful of tyres, including two existing Goodyear XPLR tyres, several from Schwalbe and its own <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/zipp-tangente-g40-brand-new-40mm-gravel-tyre\">Tangente G40</a>. The recently launched Pirelli P Zero Race TLR 40mm, which <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/pirelli-p-zero-race-tlr-40mm-road-tyre-review\">we’ve reviewed</a>, isn’t on the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re finding 40mm tyres hard to swallow, Goodyear has also launched the snappily named Eagle F1 R Z29 Aero, designed to offer a 29mm width on the 23mm internal width hookless rim on the Zipp 404 and 454 wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tyre has what Zipp/Goodyear call an aero lip, which fills the gap between the tyre and the rim. The aero lip is claimed to improve aero efficiency, but also to protect against pinch flats. The casing has a 180 tpi thread count, there’s puncture protection and a low rolling resistance compound and the tyre has a 270g weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with the Vector R XPLR, it’s priced at £90 / $90 / €100 / AU$155.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"'sign up to the cyclist newsletter' banner, saying 'opinions, offers, insights and updates'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/zipp-integrated-tyre-pressure-sensor-353-nsw-303-sw-wheels\">Zipp adds an integrated tyre pressure sensor to its updated 353 NSW and 303 SW wheels</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"375e514098585227a918f39e3505c7360aec22426e9ffe1c6db4b2a14a9ff44d","category":"Cycling"}
