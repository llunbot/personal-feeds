What do you think of ‌macOS Sequoia so far? Let us know in the comments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>1. Distraction Control</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/distraction-control-sequoia.jpg\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1412\" />\r<br />\nIf you are tired of pop-ups and banners interrupting your web browsing experience, it's worth getting to know Distraction Control, a new Safari feature that helps you focus on the content that matters by minimizing intrusive elements on webpages. While it's not designed as an ad blocker, Distraction Control can significantly improve your reading experience by hiding static distractions. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/distraction-control-macos.jpg\" alt=\"safari\" width=\"2566\" height=\"1452\" />\r<br />\nTo nix a distracting item on a webpage, click the Page menu icon in the address bar and select Hide Distracting Items. Then simply hover your pointer over the item in question, whereupon it will be auto-selected for removal. With another click, the distraction will disintegrate before your eyes. When you're finished, click Done in the address bar. If you're on a webpage where you've hidden items, a crossed out eye icon will appear in the address bar, indicating that you can make them visible again by revisiting the Page menu and selecting Show Hidden Items.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>2. Window Tiling</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/tiling-macos-two-apps.jpg\" width=\"2940\" height=\"1912\" />\r<br />\nWith macOS Sequoia, Apple has introduced a new window tiling management feature that aims to make it easy to arrange open windows into a layout that works best for you. When you drag a window to the edge of the screen, ‌macOS Sequoia‌ suggests a tiled position by displaying a frame, and you release the window to drop it right into place. This way, you can quickly arrange two app windows side by side, or place four windows in corners to keep several apps in view at once. When a window has been dragged to tile on one side or the other, dragging it back immediately resizes it to its original width and height. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/tiling-options-green-traffic-light.jpg\" width=\"842\" height=\"642\" />\r<br />\nmacOS 15 also adds new tiling options to the green traffic light in the top corner of windows. Hover your pointer over the green button, and a menu appears with options to move and resize or fill and arrange all open windows.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>3. Adjust AirPods Adaptive Audio</h2>\r<br />\nApple's second-generation AirPods Pro have an Adaptive Audio feature that includes Adaptive Noise Control, Personalized Volume, and Conversation Awareness, which are all features that adjust sound and Active Noise Cancellation in response to the environment around you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/adaptive-audio-slider-macos.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"1430\" height=\"662\" />\r<br />\nPreviously, Adaptive Audio was an all or nothing setting, but that's changed in macOS Sequoia. Apple has added a \"Customize Adaptive Audio\" menu that lets you adjust the setting to allow for more or less noise.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>4. AirPods Pro Head Gestures</h2>\r<br />\nWith the new head gesture features, users can control Siri on the ‌AirPods Pro‌ with a shake or a nod of the head. If you get a phone call, for example, you can shake your head no if you don't want to answer it, or nod to accept the call. ‌Siri‌ interactions can be used for responding to incoming messages, calls, and notifications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/head-gestures-macos.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"1430\" height=\"423\" />\r<br />\nIn Sequoia, Apple has added a section to the AirPods Pro menu in System Settings, enabling you to turn the gestures on and off.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>5. Game Porting Toolkit 2</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/game-porting-toolkit-2.jpg\" alt=\"games\" width=\"2040\" height=\"1212\" />\r<br />\nApple's <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/games/game-porting-toolkit/\">Game Porting Toolkit 2</a> allows developers to run unmodified Windows executables on Apple silicon Macs using the evaluation environment for Windows PC games, but end users can use it to run games too. The latest version supports an even larger set of game technologies, improved graphics and compute compatibility, ray tracing, the AVX2 instruction set, and increased performance. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>6. New Dynamic Wallpapers</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/macos-sequoia-wallpaper-night.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nSequoia features several new wallpapers, including dynamic versions. The wallpapers feature the sequoia trees that ‌macOS Sequoia‌ is named for. The imagery likely comes from Sequoia National Park, located in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains of California. There are three separate versions of the wallpaper for different times of day: Sequoia Sunrise, Sequoia Morning, and Sequoia Night.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/sequoia-wallpapers.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1514\" />\r<br />\nEach wallpaper is animated and will shift slightly at the Lock Screen when you unlock your Mac, plus there is an option to set it as a screen saver. There's also a fun new Macintosh dynamic wallpaper and screensaver combination that highlights classic Mac icons. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>7. New Chess Graphics</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/sequoia-chess.jpg\" alt=\"chess\" width=\"2128\" height=\"1578\" />\r<br />\nApple has significantly updated the built-in Chess app in macOS Sequoia, marking its first major overhaul since macOS 10.3 in 2003. While not typically frequently used, the Chess app has received a substantial visual upgrade. It now boasts improved textures, lighting effects, and rendering for both the board and pieces. Users can also enjoy new aesthetic options with wood, metal, and marble skins for the game elements. Despite these enhancements, Apple has ensured backwards compatibility allowing users to access and continue their previously saved games in the new version. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>8. Safari Video Viewer</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/sequoia-video-viewer.jpg\" alt=\"safari\" width=\"2462\" height=\"1420\" />\r<br />\nWhen watching a video in Safari, click the menu icon in the left-hand side of the address bar and select the new Video Viewer option. This makes the playing video expand within the Safari window into a kind of theater mode that blurs everything out behind it, bringing the content front and center. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/safari-video-viewer.jpg\" alt=\"safari\" width=\"2392\" height=\"1768\" />\r<br />\nIt also includes a native playback controls interface that replaces YouTube's – or the UI of whatever video you are playing. Options include AirPlay, volume, Picture in Picture, and playback speed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>9. Move &amp; Resize Windows Controls</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/windows-resizing-macos.jpg\" alt=\"macos\" width=\"2750\" height=\"1190\" />\r<br />\nAccessed from the menu bar, a new \"Move &amp; Resize\" option in the Window menu allows you to easily manage and arrange windows on your screen by offering various tiling and resizing options. You can move a window to the top, bottom, left, or right half of the screen, or position it into one of the four corners if you prefer a quarter-screen layout. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nmacOS also provides more flexible arrangements, such as splitting the screen horizontally or vertically, where you can tile windows side by side or one above the other. For even more control, there's a feature to quickly return a window to its previous size and position, making it easy to undo any changes. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>10. Set Scenes in Freeform</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/freeform-scenes.jpg\" alt=\"freeform\" width=\"931\" height=\"628\" />\r<br />\nIn the Freeform app, Apple has introduced \"scenes\" to make it easier to navigate and present Freeform boards. Scenes are saved views of specific sections of your board, offering a versatile way to organize and present your work. By creating scenes, you can divide your board into distinct, labeled sections, making it easier to navigate through complex content. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo create a scene, open a board with content, then zoom and scroll until you frame the part of your board you want on the screen for your first scene. Then click the three bullets icon and click Add Scene. Simply repeat these steps until you capture all the scenes you want.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>11. Collapse Sections in Notes</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/notes-collapsible-headings-macos2.jpg\" alt=\"notes\" width=\"1498\" height=\"668\" />\r<br />\nIn the Notes app, if you have long notes with multiple headings, you can now collapse those headings down to create a more compact note.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/notes-collapsible-headings-macos1.jpg\" alt=\"notes\" width=\"1458\" height=\"432\" />\r<br />\nAny section header can be collapsed, including headings, subheadings, and titles. Just click on a heading and then click on the down arrow to collapse it. Click the arrow again to open it up.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>12. New Passwords App</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/passwords-app-macos.jpg\" alt=\"passwords\" width=\"2036\" height=\"1216\" />\r<br />\nApple added a dedicated Passwords app in macOS Sequoia‌, where logins and passwords stored in iCloud Keychain can be accessed. It's essentially the Passwords section that used to be located in Safari's settings, but in a dedicated app that makes it easier to find your stored login information. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app has a simple layout with a search bar in the top-right of the window, so you can look up the information that you're looking for. If you've already used the ‌iCloud‌ Keychain feature, all of your saved logins and passwords are ready to go as soon as you authenticate with Touch ID or your Mac password. There are separate sections for passwords and logins (under All), Passkeys, two-factor authentication codes, Wi-Fi passwords, security warnings, and logins that have been deleted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can click in to any of the sections to see what's listed there, and selecting an individual entry shows the login and password. Each entry has fields for site or app name, username, login, verification code, websites where the login is used, and notes. There's also an option for changing your password for any given entry.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>13. iPhone Mirroring</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iphone-mirroring-jiggle-mode.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nApple has added support for iPhone Mirroring, one of the main updates coming to the Mac. ‌iPhone‌ Mirroring is a Continuity feature that lets you control your ‌iPhone‌ from your Mac. When you're signed in to the same Apple Account on a Mac and an ‌iPhone‌, you can use ‌iPhone‌ Mirroring to interact with your ‌iPhone‌ even when the ‌iPhone‌ is locked. You can open up and use apps, deal with notifications, send messages, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iphone-screen-mirroring.jpg\" width=\"2501\" height=\"1407\" />\r<br />\nYou can use your Mac keyboard, trackpad, or mouse with your ‌iPhone‌, which is useful for typing up long emails and other documents on the ‌iPhone‌, and it provides an easy way to keep up with your ‌iPhone‌ notifications without having to pull out your device and check it. When you click on a notification on your Mac when using ‌iPhone‌ Mirroring, it is supposed to open up right into the app on your ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a future update, ‌iPhone‌ Mirroring will allow files, photos, and videos to be dragged and dropped between your ‌iPhone‌ and Mac and vice versa.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>14. Screen Recording Permissions</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/screen-recording-permissions-macos-15.jpg\" alt=\"permissions\" width=\"1412\" height=\"822\" />\r<br />\nIf you use an app that can record or share your screen, a new permissions popup will appear that allows you to permit access for one month. You'll encounter the same popup for the same app on a monthly basis, as part of Apple's efforts to improve macOS security measures.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>15. iPhone Notifications</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-notifications-macos-1.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"1604\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nIn System Settings ➝ Notifications, there's an \"Allow notifications from iPhone\" menu that gives you several options. These include options to enable or disable sounds for notifications from iPhone, select which specific app notifications to mirror, and turn the entire feature on and off. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>16. Show Passwords in Menu Bar</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/passwords-menu-bar-item.jpg\" alt=\"passwords\" width=\"2453\" height=\"1635\" />\r<br />\nIf you want to make access to the new Passwords app a lot more convenient, go to Passwords ➝ Settings... and check the box next to \"Show Passwords in Menu Bar.\" When you're next on a website in Safari that you have login credentials for, click the key icon in the menu bar, and you'll see the dropdown menu automatically detect which login details you're looking for, ready for you to select. This also works with other browsers that have the iCloud Passwords browser extension installed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>17. Highlight Text in Notes</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/notes-color-highlighting-macos.jpg\" alt=\"notes\" width=\"1856\" height=\"1292\" />\r<br />\nThe Notes app now supports colors for typed text, allowing for highlighting. Apple added five colors, including pink, purple, orange, mint, and blue, with the colors able to be added through the formatting interface. Simply click on the <strong>Aa</strong> button to get to the color options when a word or phrase is selected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>18. Change Which iPhone to Mirror</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/choose-iphone-to-mirror.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"1542\" height=\"598\" />\r<br />\nIn the event that you own more than one iPhone, in System Settings ➝ Desktop &amp; Dock, under \"Widgets,\" there's a new iPhone option that lets you choose which iPhone to mirror on your desktop.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>19. Safari Highlights</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/safari-highlights-macos.jpg\" alt=\"safari\" width=\"932\" height=\"662\" />\r<br />\nWhen you're browsing in Safari, look for a purple sparkle over the tool icon in the browser bar. This indicates Highlights are available. Think of Highlights as a kind of smart assistant within Safari, saving you time and effort by eliminating the need to manually search through lengthy web content. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nClick the sparkle to open the Highlights window. This can display address details and operating hours for businesses, and give you quick access to directions. When browsing pages about people, it might show brief biographical information, and for entertainment content it can offer direct links to play songs or summarize reviews for movies and TV shows.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>20. Remove Margins From Tiled Windows</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/tiled-windows-have-margins.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"1490\" height=\"668\" />\r<br />\nIf you're not a fan of the spaces between tiled windows and don't like how the desktop seeps through the margins, there's a new option in System Settings ➝ Desktop &amp; Dock that lets you remove them. Under the \"Windows\" section, look for the toggle called \"Tiled windows have margins.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>21. Math Notes</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/math-notes-macos.jpg\" width=\"1688\" height=\"1054\" />\r<br />\nApple has added a powerful new feature to your Mac's Calculator app: Math Notes. This integration between Calculator and Notes offers a versatile tool for all your calculation needs. It's particularly handy for splitting bills, calculating group expenses, or working through more complex mathematical problems.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMath Notes allows you to type equations directly into a note, with automatic solving when you add an equals sign. You can perform a wide range of calculations, including defining variables for more complex math. For example, if you're planning a night out, you could write \"dinner = $57\" and \"movies = $24\" in a note, then simply type \"dinner + movies =\" to get the total cost. To access the feature, click the calculator symbol at the bottom left of the calculator window and select Math Notes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou're not limited to accessing Math Notes through the Calculator app – you can also use the feature directly within the Notes app using any new or existing note. In fact, you can get Math results almost anywhere in the operating system. If you type an equation into Spotlight, for example, you'll get a result, and the same goes for apps like Messages.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>22. New AirDrop Interface</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/airdrop-sequoia.jpg\" alt=\"airdrop\" width=\"790\" height=\"404\" />\r<br />\nSequoia includes a new UI for AirDrop that shows you a progress bar and even gives you the option to show the file in Finder once the transfer is complete, making it a lot easier to find what you've received on your Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>23. iPhone Mirroring Controls</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-mirroring-buttons.jpg\" alt=\"mirroring\" width=\"988\" height=\"690\" />\r<br />\nWhen using iPhone Mirroring, if you hover your pointer just above the iPhone screen it will reveal its window and two buttons to quickly access the Home Screen and the App Switcher. There are also keyboard shortcuts to access apps, while pressing Command and the +/- keys increases and decreases the size of the mirroring window.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>24. New Window Sharing Options</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/window-sharing-sequoia.jpg\" alt=\"sharing\" width=\"3023\" height=\"1201\" />\r<br />\nmacOS Sequoia's Presenter Preview feature improves screen sharing by allowing you to share specific apps or windows instead of the entire screen. You can adjust what's being shared during a call, adding or removing windows as needed. There are also buttons to show all windows and change the presenter overlay size, giving you more control over the content being presented.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/presenter-preview.jpg\" alt=\"preview\" width=\"1312\" height=\"874\" />\r<br />\nmacOS uses a video controller at the top-right corner of the screen during video calls, which includes controls for webcam features when in use. This panel also now shows a preview of what's being shared, helping you stay aware of what others can see on your desktop during screen sharing sessions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>25. New FaceTime Backgrounds</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/macos-sequoia-facetime-backgrounds.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nmacOS Sequoia includes a set of new backgrounds for FaceTime calls, including several that showcase features of Apple Park. There are nine backgrounds in all, featuring iconic locations around the company's circular headquarters in Cupertino, California.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther new built-in backgrounds that can be used for ‌FaceTime‌ and other video calls to blur out and hide what's behind you include different color gradients, along with the ability to use photos from your photo library.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>26. Private Wi-Fi Address Options</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/private-wi-fi-address-1.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"1538\" height=\"696\" />\r<br />\nIn System Settings ➝ Wi-Fi, if you click the Details button next to the currently connected network, there's a new Private Wi-Fi address option that may be familiar to users with iOS devices. A fixed private address reduces cross-network tracking by using a unique Wi-Fi address on the network. You can make it Fixed, Rotating, or turn off the option. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>27. Record and Transcribe Voice Notes</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/notes-voice-recording-macos.jpg\" alt=\"notes\" width=\"1512\" height=\"1220\" />\r<br />\nApple has made a significant enhancement to the Notes app, introducing a built-in audio recording feature that streamlines the process of capturing and transcribing voice notes.

As users record, the app automatically generates a real-time transcript, making it easier to review and search through recorded content.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo record a voice note, simply click the new waveform icon in the Notes toolbar. An interface will appear on the right showing the audio recording controls, as well as a speech bubble icon that you can use to view the transcript. When you've finished your recording, it will be saved in the note along with the accompanying transcription.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>28. Web App Content Blocker Support</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/web-app-extensions-macos-1.jpg\" width=\"1742\" height=\"1004\" />\r<br />\nIn Sequoia, web apps now support content blockers and Safari extensions, making the webpage content they present more customizable. You can control these settings by selecting Settings in the web app's menu bar, and clicking the Extensions tab.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>29. Window Title Bar Double-Click Options</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/title-bar-double-click.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"1520\" height=\"1054\" />\r<br />\nIn System Settings ➝ Desktop &amp; Dock, there's a new option to change the behavior of a window when you double-click its title bar. In Sonoma, the default behavior is to zoom the window, but in Sequoia you can change \"Double-click a window's title bar to\" Fill, Zoom, Minimize, or Do Nothing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>30. Hover Typing</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/hover-typing-macos.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"1796\" height=\"731\" />\r<br />\nIf you struggle to see what you're typing in a text field in macOS, this new feature should be very welcome. In System Settings ➝ Accessibility ➝ Hover Text, there's a new Hover Typing option that when enabled will enlarge any input field that you're typing into so that it's displayed more clearly across the center of the screen. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>31. Calculator Changes</h2>\r<br />\nIn line with iOS 18, the Calculator app for macOS has been updated, so that it now shows full expressions as you type them out. You can click on this display to undo the last thing you typed, or use the backspace button that appears when you begin pressing buttons.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/calculator-sequoia.jpg\" alt=\"calculator\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nBy clicking the button with the calculator icon, you can now also switch between Basic, Scientific, and Programmer calculators, open your Math Notes, or switch to a plethora of conversion options using Convert.

App Store Free Space Requirements</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/Mac-App-Store-General-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nApp downloads and installations from the Mac App Store will no longer require double the amount of local storage space available. Instead, the free space requirement now matches the final install size of the app, plus a small buffer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has told developers to update any messaging related to app size requirements to reflect the change, which should reduce confusion about how much free space is needed for new app installations. The new space requirement in macOS 15 should benefit users who download large games in particular.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>33. RCS Messaging</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-beta-3-messages-rcs-toggle.jpg\" width=\"2050\" height=\"1153\" />\r<br />\nRich Communication Services (RCS) is a messaging standard Apple has adopted in macOS Sequoia and iOS 18 to bridge the gap between green and blue bubbles. With RCS Messaging (Settings ➝ Messages ➝ RCS Messaging) and Text Message Forwarding enabled on your iPhone (Settings ➝ Messages ➝ Text Message Forwarding) for your Mac, you can enjoy all the capabilities RCS brings cross-platform conversations right on your desktop. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith RCS support, you can send texts, high resolution photos and videos, links, and more through the Messages app, just as if they were iMessages. RCS also supports delivery and read receipts and typing indicators. Note that RCS support must be enabled by each carrier. You can check if your network supports it by visiting Apple's <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/109526\">Wireless carrier support webpage</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>34. New iCloud Settings Panel</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/icloud-settings-panel.jpg\" alt=\"iCloud\" width=\"1430\" height=\"1380\" />\r<br />\nJust like on iPhone with iOS 18, the iCloud section in System Settings ➝ Apple Account has been completely redesigned for macOS Sequoia. The panel is divided into neater sections showing your storage, files saved to iCloud, and any iCloud+ features you may have, making everything just a little bit easier to comprehend. You can also manage how individual apps and features on your Mac sync with iCloud by clicking the See All button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>35.
