There are fitness rings out there already, like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/04/review-oura-ring-3-and-whoop-4-0-are-2-ambitious-wearables-but-theyre-tough-sells/\">Oura Ring</a> and a few others, but this is the first one from one of the world's largest tech companies. Samsung already teased this device last month at the Galaxy S24 launch, and what we're getting at MWC are renders, brief glimpses of prototypes, and a few scraps of information.</p>\n<p>What can you say about the design of the Galaxy Ring? It's a circle. Samsung's primary color has a shiny metal outside (the colors are not finalized yet) and what looks like a black plastic interior for the ring, which is packed full of sensors. Fitting health-tracking sensors, a battery, CPU, and Bluetooth into a ring form factor is a huge challenge, so it's no surprise that the whole contraption is thicker and wider than a jewelry ring would normally be.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"Like all smart rings, the Galaxy Ring is bigger than a normal piece of jewelry. \" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2b577850-d47c-11ee-aee7-37a111ca7e65.webp\" /><p>Like all smart rings, the Galaxy Ring is bigger than a normal piece of jewelry.

All of this data will be built into the Galaxy Health app. The Verge couldn't get a battery-life estimate out of Samsung, but Korean site <a href=\"https://www.fnnews.com/news/202402270448524031\">FNNews</a> was told the ring would last \"about 5 to 9 days\" before needing to be charged.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006159#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006159&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"708f760d083586d8497d322d73a6b76a1f5edc17cea1554ba663d3b0b6137956","category":"Tech"}
