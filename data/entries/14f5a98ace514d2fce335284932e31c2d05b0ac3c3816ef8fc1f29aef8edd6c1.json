That important \"day one\" perk is now set to go away for all but the highest tier of Game Pass' console subscribers, even as Microsoft asks for more money for Game Pass across the board.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the price increases for existing Game Pass tiers, which are relatively straightforward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Game Pass Ultimate\" is going from $16.99 to $19.99 per month.</li>\n<li>\"Game Pass for PC\" is going from $9.99 to $11.99 per month.</li>\n<li>\"Game Pass Core\" (previously known as Xbox Live Gold) is going from $59.99 to $74.99 for annual subscriptions (and remains at $9.99 for monthly subscriptions).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Things get a bit more complicated for the <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/xbox-game-pass-for-console/CFQ7TTC0K6L8\"> $10.99/month \"Xbox Game Pass for Console\"</a> tier. Microsoft announced that it will no longer accept new subscriptions for that tier after today, though current subscribers will be able to keep it (for now) if they auto-renew their subscriptions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036150#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036150&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"14f5a98ace514d2fce335284932e31c2d05b0ac3c3816ef8fc1f29aef8edd6c1","category":"Tech"}
