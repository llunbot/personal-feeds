Beyond active noise cancellation, there are a handful of additional features that differentiate the two ‌AirPods 4‌ models. This buyer's guide breaks down all of the differences between the two variants and helps you to decide which best fits your needs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>AirPods\r<br />\n(Fourth-Generation, 2024)</th>\r<br />\n <th>AirPods With ANC\r<br />\n(Fourth-Generation, 2024)</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n<tr>\r<br />\n<td></td>\r<br />\n<td>Active Noise Cancellation</td>\r<br />\n</tr>\r<br />\n<tr>\r<br />\n<td></td>\r<br />\n<td>Transparency mode</td>\r<br />\n</tr>\r<br />\n<tr>\r<br />\n<td></td>\r<br />\n<td>Adaptive Audio</td>\r<br />\n</tr>\r<br />\n<tr>\r<br />\n<td></td>\r<br />\n<td>Conversation Awareness</td>\r<br />\n</tr>\r<br />\n<tr>\r<br />\n<td>USB-C Char­ging Case</td>\r<br />\n<td>USB‑C Wireless Char­ging Case with support for Apple Watch charger and Qi‑certified wireless chargers</td>\r<br />\n</tr>\r<br />\n<tr>\r<br />\n<td>Support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a></td>\r<br />\n<td>Support for ‌Find My‌ with speaker in charging case</td>\r<br />\n</tr>\r<br />\n<tr>\r<br />\n<td>Charging case weighs 1.14 ounces (32.3 grams) </td>\r<br />\n<td>Charging case weighs 1.22 ounces (34.7 grams)</td>\r<br />\n</tr>\r<br />\n<tr>\r<br />\n<td>$129</td>\r<br />\n<td>$179</td>\r<br />\n</tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChoosing between the ‌AirPods 4‌ and the ‌AirPods 4‌ with ANC ultimately depends on whether active noise cancellation is a priority for you. If you frequently find yourself in noisy environments—such as commuting on public transport, traveling by plane, or working in cafes—the ‌AirPods 4‌ with ANC should dramatically improve your experience for just $50 more. Although the noise cancellation is not as effective as that of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> because they do not have an in-ear design with silicone tips, they perform surprisingly well for open-ear earbuds and offer enough isolation to make a difference in lower-frequency environments like engine hums and busy streets.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ability to charge with an Apple Watch or Qi wireless charger is also notable, making the ‌AirPods 4‌ with ANC considerably more versatile to charge, especially if you have an Apple Watch. The $129 AirPods can only charge via a wired USB-C connection, which is less convenient than wireless charging. However, USB-C has become such a ubiquitous cable that it is unlikely to bother users who are used to wired charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLikewise, the speaker in the charging case for ‌Find My‌ is a useful additional feature for those prone to misplacing their AirPods around the house. These added capabilities generally make the ‌AirPods 4‌ with ANC worth the extra $50 over the non-ANC model for most enthusiastic tech users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the other hand, if you haven't owned any AirPods before or simply don't feel the need for noise cancellation, the standard ‌AirPods 4‌ will be a more economical choice. They retain the sound quality improvements, spatial audio, and comfort enhancements of the ‌AirPods 4‌, but at a lower price point. For users upgrading from AirPods 2 or 3 and who rarely find themselves in noisy places, the ‌AirPods 4‌ are a good choice that will give you most of the key updates without the extra cost or additional features you may not use.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAirPods can frequently be found for lower prices at third-party retailers, so be sure to check out <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#airpods\"><em>MacRumors</em>' deals roundup</a> for the best possible price – which could reduce the price difference between the two variants and make the ANC model more accessible.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4-vs-airpods-4-with-anc-buyers-guide-which-should-you-choose/\">AirPods 4 vs. AirPods 4 With ANC Buyer's Guide: Which Should You Choose?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-4-vs-airpods-4-with-anc-buyers-guide-which-should-you-choose.2438927/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"32700974e5a809e07403d19a5a1e75c95989f65b2117cb9e8020240949e28516","category":"Apple"}
