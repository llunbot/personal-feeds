That changed today, and Apple updated its <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/106340\">AirPods firmware support page</a> with more specific instructions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/airpods-4-blue.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nPrior to today, here's what Apple said on the subject:\r<br />\n<blockquote>Firmware updates are delivered automatically while your AirPods are charging and in Bluetooth range of your iPhone, iPad, or Mac that's connected to Wi-Fi . You can also use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to check that your AirPods have the latest version.</blockquote>\r<br />\nApple still has that same information, but now it's accompanied by step-by-step instructions on how to force an update, including troubleshooting steps if your AirPods won't update.\r<br />\n<blockquote>\r<br />\n<ol>\r<br />\n \t<li>Make sure that your AirPods are in Bluetooth range of your iPhone, iPad, or Mac that's connected to Wi-Fi.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Put your AirPods in their charging case and close the lid.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Plug the charging cable into your charging case, then plug the other end of the cable into a USB charger or port.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Keep the lid of the charging case closed, and wait at least 30 minutes for the firmware to update.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Open the lid of the charging case to reconnect your AirPods to your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Check the firmware version again.</li>\r<br />\nIf you still can't update your firmware, reset your AirPods, then try to update your firmware again.\r<br />\n</ol></blockquote>\r<br />\nThis process was generally already known, but the specific steps for charging via a cable and the 30 minute+ wait time remove any ambiguity on how to get new firmware installed.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/airpods-firmware-update-instructions/\">Apple Finally Explains How to Install New Firmware on Your AirPods</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-finally-explains-how-to-install-new-firmware-on-your-airpods.2448221/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b9694d38a6ad30ad36a09629fd1d0e0e8e3b88df1ce23557336bb791e0a0dfbf","category":"Apple"}
