Since then, the German automaker replaced the X5 with an all-new model called the X5 xDrive45e. The brand has returned to its iconic inline six-cylinder engine configuration under the hood and has doubled the traction battery in capacity, usefully boosting the SUV's electric-only range.</p>\n<p>Styling-wise, the X5 xDrive45e is similar to its non-hybrid sibling. It's a big vehicle that looks particularly tall on the road. I think it lacks the handsomeness of the original X5, but the Internet already has enough takes on BMW styling and doesn't need another one from me.</p>\n<p>On the inside, all the materials you sit on or touch feel high-quality, and the driver's seat has good forward and rear visibility. However, I felt a little like I was sitting on the car (in an overstuffed armchair) rather than in it. Ahead of the driver is a thick-rimmed multifunction steering wheel and a 12.3-inch digital main instrument display.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790077#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790077&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
