He attached an\naddressed envelope that he had received from the I.R.S.; in the\nupper left-hand corner, where the return address of the taxpayer\nbelongs, is the heavy black outline of a box. Next to the box are\nthe words “X box if refund.”</p>\n\n<p>“Never mind the unanswered question, ‘If refund what?’,” the irate\ntaxpayer observed. “We all know they mean to x the box if you have\na refund coming. Maybe the ink they saved on those instructions\nwill pay for the next round of tax cuts.”</p>\n\n<p>Mr. DeLaFuente — his name means “of the fountain” — is blowing\nhis geyser for the wrong reason. The verb to x is not new. In\n1849, Edgar Allan Poe wrote in one of his tales: “‘I shell have\nto x this ere paragrab,’ said he to himself, as he read it over.”\nIn 1935, Jonas Bayer carried that crossing-out metaphor into the\nmechanical age in Startling Detective magazine: “An imported\nhatchet man with a .45-caliber typewriter can x out the dangerous\ncanary.” Merriam-Webster’s first citation in the one-letter verb’s\nliteral sense is from Henry Cassidy’s 1943 book “Moscow Dateline”:\n“I x’d out the word ‘west’ in the third question, changing it to\n‘east.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The whole column is a goldmine, including a section on the Philly accent (Eagles = “Iggles”) and another referencing perhaps the coolest-named American who ever lived, Pussyfoot Johnson.
