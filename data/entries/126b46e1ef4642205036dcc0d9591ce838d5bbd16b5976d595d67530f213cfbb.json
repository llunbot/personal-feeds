Where uphill speed matters, the direct connection from crank to axle, without energy-inefficient suspension spoiling the fun, is the quickest way to get up to speed.</p>\n<p>Riding rough-and-ready trails on a hardtail might beat you up a little more, but there’s something almost zen-like about being able to pick the smoothest line between the chunder, while pumping through rollers to generate free speed.</p>\n<p>Hardtails are often also lighter, easier to maintain and cheaper than full-suspension mountain bikes, because there are fewer moving parts to add weight, service or build in the first place.</p>\n<p>Here, we’ve put together our pick of the best hardtail mountain bikes as ridden, rated and reviewed by the BikeRadar team.</p>\n<h2>Hardtail vs full-suspension mountain bike</h2>\n<p>Stuck between whether a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/hardtail-versus-full-suspension-mountain-bike/\">hardtail or full-suspension mountain bike</a> best suits your requirements?</p>\n<p>It all depends on the type of mountain biking you would like to take part in. Hardtails are more capable than you might initially think, but full-suspension mountain bikes come into their own on more technical terrain, especially when the gradients point downwards.</p>\n<p>Budget is the biggest factor and (with few exceptions), the entry point to a full-suspension bike is much higher than that for a hardtail. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-mountain-bikes-under-1500-2/\">best mountain bikes under £1,500</a> see full-suspension start to become available and as you start to spend more, you’ll find updates in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-frame-materials/\">frame materials</a>, as well as better components and suspension specced.</p>\n\n<h2>What’s your budget?</h2>\n<p>Buying a hardtail is one of the most affordable ways into mountain biking.</p>\n<p>As a result, it’s no surprise that hardtails dominate our buyer’s guides to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-500/\">best mountain bikes under £500</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-750/\">best mountain bikes under £750</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bikes-under-1000-2/\">best mountain bikes under £1,000</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to buy a hardtail mountain bike, we’ve collated our reviews of the best bikes here, organised by price, as well as our reviews of hardtail frames.</p>\n<p>Use the links below to skip to the relevant section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#over2000\">Best hardtails over £2,000/$2,300</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#under2000\">Best hardtails under £2,000/$2,300</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#under1500\">Best hardtails under £1,500/$1,700</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#under1000\">Best hardtails under £1,000/$1,200</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#hardtailframes\">Best hardtail frames</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re in the market for a full-suspension bike, make sure you check out our guides to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">best trail bikes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downcountry-mountain-bikes/\">best downcountry bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">best enduro mountain bikes.</a></p>\n<p>We’ve also got a list of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">best cross-country bikes</a>, covering both hardtail and full-suspension designs for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cross-country-racing-guide/\">XC racing</a>.

This helps make it comfortable on climbs, and when paired with its 650b wheels it has a solid, stable feel and great descending composure.</p>\n<p>We weren’t without quibbles when testing this bike, though. The air-sprung front fork doesn’t offer great small-bump sensitivity, and a fork upgrade isn’t viable at this price. It would be nice to see Boost spacing too.</p>\n<p>Despite these points, you do get a lot of performance for the money and the Fury trumps its competitors in multiple ways.
