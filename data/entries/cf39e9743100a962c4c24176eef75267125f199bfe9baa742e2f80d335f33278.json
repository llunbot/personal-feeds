This past week alone we've seen releases or announcements of OpenAI's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/ten-months-after-first-tease-openai-launches-sora-video-generation-publicly/\">Sora</a>, Pika AI's <a href=\"https://pikartai.com/pika-2-0/\">Pika 2</a>, Google's <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-2/\">Veo 2</a>, and Minimax's <a href=\"https://x.com/fofrAI/status/1868763436974588222\">video-01-live</a>. It's frankly hard to keep up, and even tougher to test them all. But recently, we put a new open-weights AI video synthesis model, Tencent's <a href=\"https://aivideo.hunyuan.tencent.com/\">HunyuanVideo</a>, to the testâ€”and it's surprisingly capable for being a \"free\" model.</p>\n<p>Unlike the aforementioned models, HunyuanVideo's neural network weights are openly distributed, which means they can be run locally under the right circumstances (people have already <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1h7hunp/how_to_run_hunyuanvideo_on_a_single_24gb_vram_card/\">demonstrated it</a> on a consumer 24 GB VRAM GPU) and it can be fine-tuned or used with <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/blog/LoRAs-explained\">LoRAs</a> to teach it new concepts.</p>\n<p>Notably, a few Chinese companies have been at the forefront of AI video for most of this year, and some experts speculate that the reason is less reticence to train on copyrighted materials, use images and names of famous celebrities, and incorporate some uncensored video sources. As we saw with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/ridiculed-stable-diffusion-3-release-excels-at-ai-generated-body-horror/\">Stable Diffusion 3</a>'s mangled release, including nudity or pornography in training data may allow these models achieve better results by providing more information about human bodies. HunyuanVideo notably allows uncensored outputs, so unlike the commercial video models out there, it can generate videos of anatomically realistic, nude humans.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/a-new-uncensored-ai-video-model-may-spark-a-new-ai-hobbyist-movement/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/a-new-uncensored-ai-video-model-may-spark-a-new-ai-hobbyist-movement/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cf39e9743100a962c4c24176eef75267125f199bfe9baa742e2f80d335f33278","category":"Tech"}
