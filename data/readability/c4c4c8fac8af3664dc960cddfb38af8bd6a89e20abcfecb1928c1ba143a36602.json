In late 2019 they released the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/12/curves-walmer-handlebar-is-very-very-wide/\" target=\"_blank\">Walmer</a> – an ultra-wide drop bar that measures up to 750 mm at the drops. Now, they’ve come out with the Remlaw – yup, that’s ‘Walmer’ backwards. </p><p>What’s the Remlaw? It’s a flat bar for drop-bar bikes. As anyone who’s retrofitted a flat bar onto a bike with geometry designed around a drop handlebar might know, that usually ushers in some compromises, shortening the reach and negatively impacting on the bike’s handling. </p><p>The Remlaw, however, is designed to provide comparable reach and handling to a drop bar. The bit that looks like a rise goes 18 mm out to the front, getting the hands in roughly the same spot as they would be on a drop bar. There’s 12° of back sweep to give the wrists a natural position, and ample mounting space for lights, accessories, and all the other treasures you might want to schlep about with you. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/REMLAW_x_GMX_refit_02-1340x784.png\"><figcaption>Here’s a Remlaw fitted to a Curve GMX.</figcaption></figure><p>Compared to the Walmer bar – which comes in eight different widths – the Remlaw is available in a single 800 mm width, which you can trim to the dimensions preferred. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Curve-Remlaw-dimensions-1340x153.png\"></figure><p>Like the Walmer, these won’t be for everyone – but they look a neat solution for a relatively common problem, especially if you have adventurous leanings. </p><p>They’ll cost you AU$149, and you can find out more at <a href=\"https://www.curvecycling.com.au/collections/bars/products/remlaw-bar-1\">curvecycling.com.au</a></p></div></div>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"c4c4c8fac8af3664dc960cddfb38af8bd6a89e20abcfecb1928c1ba143a36602","category":"Cycling"}
