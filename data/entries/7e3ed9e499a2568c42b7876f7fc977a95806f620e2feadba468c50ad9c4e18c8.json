Panasonic Avionics' brand <a href=\"https://www.panasonic.aero/our-offerings/systems/astrova/\">Astrova</a> in-flight entertainment systems are starting to roll out on commercial flights on certain airlines, promising 4K HDR TVs and other features to the backs of seats that should be a huge upgrade over the abysmal screens we normally watch in-flight movies on.</p>\n<p>Look at most commercial airlines today, and you'll find a tiny, terrible LCD TV embedded in the seat in front of you. These HD, standard dynamic range screens have terrible contrast and poor viewing angles, and they aren't bright enough to achieve a good viewing experience when the overhead lights are on.</p>\n<p>They're bad enough that I always bring my own hardware for flights—most recently, I took three flights with Apple's Vision Pro headset, which I plan to write about later this week. But most people just bring a tablet.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012437#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012437&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7e3ed9e499a2568c42b7876f7fc977a95806f620e2feadba468c50ad9c4e18c8","category":"Tech"}
