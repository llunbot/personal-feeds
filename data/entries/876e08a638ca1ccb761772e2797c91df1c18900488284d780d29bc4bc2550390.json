Both claim that Apple is on a path to launching its first augmented reality/virtual reality headset as soon as next year and that the product will feature ultrahigh-end specifications and technologies.</p>\n<p>Writing in his weekly Bloomberg newsletter, reporter Mark Gurman says the new headset will feature \"advanced\" chips, displays, and sensors and that it will have \"avatar-based features.\" That latter point indicates that Apple has a similar vision for how the headset could be used to that of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/10/facebooks-rebrands-as-meta-amid-a-new-metaverse-first-outlook/\">Meta</a>, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been declaring a vision of social interconnectedness through AR and VR experiences.</p>\n<p>Gurman also writes that Apple's first headset will be a mixed reality one, supporting both VR and AR applications. The long-rumored consumer AR glasses will come much later, \"years down the road.\" While investment has been pouring into research on AR technology, there remain numerous major technological roadblocks to mass-market consumer AR glasses, and it is unclear when all that investment might translate into a viable, mainstream product.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809397#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809397&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"876e08a638ca1ccb761772e2797c91df1c18900488284d780d29bc4bc2550390","category":"Tech"}
