I’ll take a short break this morning to share some of the most exciting launches and other news from last week. Here we go!</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last Week’s Launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some of the launches that captured my attention:</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon EBS</strong> – The new <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-cloudwatch-metric-monitors-reachability-ebs-volumes/\"><strong>Attached EBS Status Check</strong></a> CloudWatch metric lets you monitor the status of all of the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/\">Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)</a> volumes attached to a particular <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</a> instance, verifying that the volumes are reachable and able to complete I/O operations.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Systems Manager</strong> – You can now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/enable-aws-systems-manager-ec2-instances-organization/\">enable AWS Systems Manager by default</a> for all EC2 instances within an Organization. This lets you confirm that core Systems Manager capabilities are present on all new and existing instances.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon EC2</strong> – You can now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-ec2-amis-disabled-state/\">set unused or obsolete AMIs to a disabled state</a>. This makes the AMI private if it was previously shared, hides it from<code><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeImages.html\"> DescribeImages</a></code> by default, and prevents new instances from being launched from it.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Textract</strong> – You can now use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-textract-custom-queries-information-extraction-business-specific-documents/\">Custom Queries</a> to adapt Textract’s Queries feature to improve extraction accuracy for business-specific documents. You upload sample documents, label the data, and generate an adapter, which you then use in calls to the <code><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/API_AnalyzeDocument.html\">AnalyzeDocument</a></code> function.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon OpenSearch Service</strong> – You can now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/aws-search-pipelines-opensearch/\">create Search Pipelines</a> for easier processing of queries and results. Each <a href=\"https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/search-pipelines/index/\">search pipeline</a> can contain multiple processing steps: query rewriters, natural language processors, result rerankers, and filters; several <a href=\"https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/search-pipelines/search-processors/\">standard processors</a> are also included.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Linux 2</strong> – The latest quarterly release (AL2023.2) of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/\">Amazon Linux 2</a> includes a core set of <a href=\"https://www.ansible.com/\">Ansible</a> features as well as a curated set of community collections. It also includes <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/09/amazon-corretto-21-generally-available/\">Amazon Corretto 21</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/linux/al2023/release-notes/relnotes.html\">many other new features</a> and capabilities.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Rekognition</strong> – You can now <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/accuracy-pre-trained-rekognition-moderation-model-custom-moderation/\">train custom adapters</a> to reduce the number of false positives and false negative flagged by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/\">Amazon Rekognition</a>, giving you the power to tailor the deep learning model to improve performance for your specific use case.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon RDS</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/\">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a> <a
