We’ll finish by explaining the benefits of the more expensive groupsets and discussing compatibility.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>Wait! This is too technical</h2>\n<p>Does this feel like running before you can walk? </p>\n<p>If the precise differences between bike components don’t interest you and you’re just looking for some straightforward bike buying advice, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike/\">start here with our beginner-friendly guide to different types of bike</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re sure you want a road bike, but need some general advice on what to look out for, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">head over to our best road bikes guide</a>.</p>\n<p>Happy to talk groupsets? Keep reading.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>What is a groupset?</h2>\n<p>A groupset comprises all the mechanical parts for your bike – so basically everything except the frame, fork, wheels, handlebar, seatpost and saddle.</p>\n<p>You can buy a complete groupset or the individual components and there’s some possibility to mix and match between groupsets, although many items are not intercompatible.</p>\n<p>When you buy a new bike, a bike maker will often sub in some cheaper parts with a groupset, so you might for example get a chainset that’s from a different level or even a different brand from the rest of the groupset.</p>\n<p>The components of a full groupset are:</p>\n<ul><li>Crankset (also called the chainset)</li>\n<li>Bottom bracket (the bearings in the frame on which the crankset spins)</li>\n<li>Brake levers/shift levers, usually combined</li>\n<li>Rear derailleur</li>\n<li>Front derailleur</li>\n<li>Cassette (the gear sprockets at the rear of the bike)</li>\n<li>Chain</li>\n<li>Brakes</li>\n</ul><p>There’s an explainer of each component and more groupset specifics later in this post.</p>\n<h2>Shimano groupsets: different levels explained</h2>\n<p>Shimano is the oldest and most widely used of the three main brands. It began life in Japan in 1921 when Shozaburo Shimano decided to start making freewheels in a rented corner of a demolished celluloid factory.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to today, and it’s become so successful that Shimano now accounts for half of the global bike components industry.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <p><strong>Shimano road groupset hierarchy:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Claris:</strong> 8-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Sora:</strong> 9-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Tiagra:</strong> 10-speed</li>\n<li><strong>105:</strong> 11-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Ultegra:</strong> 11-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Ultegra Di2:</strong> 11-speed electronic</li>\n<li><strong>Dura-Ace:</strong> 11-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Dura-Ace Di2:</strong> 11-speed electronic</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Shimano gravel groupset hierarchy:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>GRX RX400:</strong> 10-speed</li>\n<li><strong>GRX RX600:</strong> 11-speed (apart from 10-speed version of crank)</li>\n<li><strong>GRX RX810:</strong> 11-speed</li>\n<li><strong>GRX RX815:</strong> 11-speed electronic</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h3>Entry-level Shimano groupsets: Claris, Sora and Tiagra</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The latest Claris R2000 groupset borrows design cues from its more expensive siblings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p>The Shimano component range starts with the budget-priced <strong>Claris</strong>, which is usually found on the most affordable bikes available.</p>\n<p>Claris is an 8-speed system (eight gears at the rear) combined with either a double or triple crankset (two or three gears at the front).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano Sora is a 9-speed groupset commonly seen on many budget road bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p>Next is <strong>Sora</strong>, which can also be found on entry-level bikes and is a 9-speed system available in either standard double cranksets or a wide-range triple.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tiagra sticks with 10-speed.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Then comes <strong>Tiagra</strong>, a 10-speed groupset that offers a near-105 experience, but economises in specific areas, for example with one-piece brake pads rather than higher quality cartridge pads.</p>\n<p>Since 2019, Tiagra has included its own hydraulic disc brakes with levers that resemble those of 105.

The naming scheme looks like this:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Tiagra level:</strong> RX400</li>\n<li><strong>105 level:</strong> RX600</li>\n<li><strong>Ultegra level:</strong> RX800 (Ultegra mechanical shifters are ST-RX810, Ultegra Di2 shifters are ST-RX815)</li>\n</ul><p>GRX includes dedicated hydraulic levers, cyclocross-style inline levers, clutch-equipped Shadow RD+ rear derailleurs, front derailleurs and 1× and 2× cranks.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>The latest Shimano GRX groupset deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>SRAM groupsets: different levels explained</h2>\n<p>SRAM came to the fore during the mountain biking boom of the late eighties and established itself off the back of its lightweight GripShift shifters.</p>\n<p>SRAM introduced its lightweight RED road groupset in 2007 and now produces an extensive range of components for road and cyclocross bikes alongside its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">mountain bike groupsets</a>.</p>\n<p>SRAM’s road groupset range comprises four main groups: Apex, Rival, Force and RED  (in ascending order of price). All of its road groupsets now include a hydraulic disc brake option. Its three top-tier groupsets – Rival, Force and RED – are also available in 12-speed wireless electronic variants.</p>\n<p>With the focus on electronic groupsets, SRAM hasn’t made major updates to its mechanical groupset range for some years now and, as a result, it’s looking a little long in the tooth.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <p><strong>SRAM groupset hierarchy:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Apex:</strong> 10-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Apex 1:</strong> 11-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Rival:</strong> 11-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Rival eTap AXS:</strong> 12-speed wireless electronic</li>\n<li><strong>Force:</strong> 11-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Force eTap AXS:</strong> 12-speed wireless electronic</li>\n<li><strong>RED:</strong> 11-speed</li>\n<li><strong>RED eTap:</strong> 11-speed</li>\n<li><strong>RED eTap AXS:</strong> 12-speed wireless electronic</li>\n</ul><p><strong>SRAM XPLR gravel groupset hierarchy:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Rival eTap AXS XPLR: </strong>12-speed wireless electronic</li>\n<li><strong>Force eTap AXS XPLR: </strong>12-speed wireless electronic</li>\n<li><strong>RED eTap AXS XPLR: </strong>12-speed wireless electronic</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h3>Entry-level SRAM groupsets: Apex</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM Apex, the American brand’s entry-level road groupset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p><strong>Apex</strong> is a 10-speed group that features SRAM’s WiFli system. WiFli offers a wide gear range – between 11 and 32 teeth – for the rear cassette (certain SRAM road derailleurs will go as high as a 36t big cog).</p>\n<p>That allows SRAM to offer the wide range of gears usually found by using a triple front chainring setup without the extra weight and complexity of a triple. Once a unique selling point for SRAM, other manufacturers are now offering similar setups.</p>\n<p>SRAM also offers its Apex group in 1×11 gearing, calling it <strong>Apex 1</strong>. That is to say, just one chainring at the front and 11 gears at the rear. An Apex 1 rear derailleur can accommodate a cassette with a large 42-tooth cog.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>The latest SRAM Apex groupsets deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Performance SRAM groupsets: Rival, Rival eTap AXS, Force, and Force eTap AXS</h3>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM Rival 22 was launched as a direct competitor to Shimano 105.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>Next up the line is <strong>Rival</strong>, which can also use a wide range WiFli rear derailleur and cassette, but is made from lighter materials than Apex.</p>\n<p>Rival is 11-speed and it can be found with a more common two chainrings at the front (2×11) or just one (1×11).</p>\n<p>In 2021 SRAM launched <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-rival-etap-axs-review/\">Rival eTap AXS</a>.

This gives you a slightly easier climbing gear while still retaining a big top gear. It is a popular option among competitive amateur riders</li>\n<li>The <strong><a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/road/gear/article/what-is-a-compact-crank-38845/\">compact crankset</a></strong> is 50/34. It has become very popular thanks to its combination of easy gearing and low weight</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/road/gear/article/super-compact-chainsets-the-next-big-thing-for-road-cyclists-48974/\">Super-compact or sub-compact cranksets</a></strong> offer an even lower gear range on double chainrings such as 48t/32, 48/31 or 46/30. These are becoming popular with gravel riders and bikepackers who want low, closely spaced gearing</li>\n<li>SRAM upset the applecart when it went 12-speed and introduced cassettes with a 10t small cog, rather than 11 teeth. That lets it achieve similar gear ratios with smaller chainrings, saving weight and offering even wider ranges. SRAM’s second-tier Force eTap AXS groupset <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-force-etap-axs-wide-gearing/\">now includes a low-range 43/30t option for example</a>.</li>\n</ul><h4>Triple cranksets</h4>\n<ul><li>The <strong>triple</strong> is an older type commonly seen on vintage road bikes and touring bikes. It offers a wide range of gears, but at a weight penalty. It typically combines a 50t outer ring, a 39t middle ring and an inner ring that has just 30 teeth. It is popular with touring cyclists who value a super-small ‘granny ring’ when loaded down with panniers.</li>\n</ul><h4>Single cranksets</h4>\n<ul><li>The <strong>single-ring crankset</strong> – also known as 1× (pronounced ‘one-by’) – has only one chainring. To compensate for the loss of the smaller, inner ring, a 1× crankset is often matched to a wider-range cassette. Single ring cranksets use alternating wide and narrow teeth with a higher profile, to aid chain retention.</li>\n</ul><h3>Road bike shifters explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> While the overall shape is similar, the three major brands have their own different methods of shifting.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For the most part, modern road bikes use dual-action shifters that incorporate the gear levers into the brake levers.</p>\n<p>Each brand has its own spin on the concept, so how you shift mechanical gears on a Shimano-equipped bike is slightly different to how you shift on a Campagnolo- or SRAM-equipped bike.</p>\n<p>Electronic shifting still relies on paddles built into the brake levers but uses small servomotors in the derailleurs to make them move.</p>\n<p>Electronic drivetrains offer consistently precise shifting and lower maintenance than a mechanically actuated drivetrain.</p>\n<p>For a full explanation of how the different systems change gear, read our detailed article on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/technique/how-to-change-gear-on-a-bike/\">how to change gear on a road bike</a>.</p>\n<h3>Road bike brakes explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Road brakes come in various forms, but basically, boil down to rim brakes (left) and disc brakes (right).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The complications don’t end with the various shift actions and whether they’re mechanically or electronically actuated. The variety of brakes used on road bikes has also grown more complex in the last few years.</p>\n<p>In the past, cable-operated, caliper rim brakes were the only type used on road bikes. But recent years have seen road bike braking options expand to take in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/road/gear/article/direct-mount-vs-disc-brakes-52918/\">direct-mount rim calipers</a>, hydraulic rim calipers (these remain exceptionally rare), cable-operated disc brakes, and hydraulic disc brakes.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Disc brakes are gradually taking over on road bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith</i></span></div>\n<p>Hydraulic disc brakes are generally considered to be the best all-round option, but which type of brake is best for you is dependent on a number of factors. Understanding <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">how road disc brakes work</a> will help you decide.</p>\n<p>All three groupset makers now offer hydraulic disc brake options alongside rim brakes for the majority of their groupsets, and they’re increasingly common on new bikes.</p>\n<h3>Road bike derailleurs explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rear derailleur does the important job of shifting gears at the cassette.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The derailleurs are the mechanisms – sometimes mech for short – that move the chain from one gear to the next.</p>\n<p>The front derailleur does the job for the front chainrings, while the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleur</a> does it for the cassette; both are controlled by the shifters.</p>\n<h3>Road bike cassettes explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> With the launch of its AXS groupsets, SRAM added a twelfth cog and started its cassettes with a 10t.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The cassette is the cluster of sprockets that’s mounted on the rear wheel, and the more sprockets on a cassette, the more ‘speeds’ the groupset is said to have.</p>\n<p>So, if there are 10 sprockets, you have a 10-speed groupset; 11 sprockets is an 11-speed groupset, and so on.</p>\n<p>(Note: ‘speeds’ only refers to the number of sprockets, not the total number of gears available; for that, you’d need to factor in the number of chainrings on the crankset.)</p>\n<p>Having more sprockets not only provides you with a wider range of gears but also means the jumps between them tend to be smaller.</p>\n<p>Smaller gaps mean it’s easier to maintain an optimal pedalling <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/what-is-cycling-cadence/\">cadence</a> as you shift from one gear to the next, and are therefore preferred by racers.</p>\n<p>For road bikes with a double crankset, 11-28t is probably the most common cassette range, but Shimano, SRAM and Campagnolo all offer a huge range of choices to suit your riding.</p>\n<p>It’s becoming more common to see wider range cassettes fitted as standard, with ratios such as 11-32t or even 11-34t appearing on some bikes, while SRAM offers a 10-36t 12-speed cassette in its eTap AXS Force and Rival ranges.</p>\n<h3>Road bike chains explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A road bike chain is an often-overlooked component that deserves love and regular cleaning.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The groupset brand and number of gears dictate the type of chain you require (groupsets with a ‘higher’ number of gears require narrower chains).</p>\n<p>More expensive chains also often have smoother, more durable and more corrosion-resistant coatings than their cheaper counterparts.</p>\n<p>Additionally, some more expensive chains have the pins and plates drilled to remove weight.</p>\n<p>Note that a chain is a wear item and should be replaced at regular intervals. There are tools that will tell you <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-know-when-its-time-to-replace-your-bicycle-chain/\">when to replace your bike’s chain</a>.</p>\n<p>Failure to do this will accelerate wear on your cassette and chainrings, but you can extend chain life by only using the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/chain-lubes/\">best chain lubes for your bike</a>.</p>\n<h3>Road bike bottom brackets explained</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A bottom bracket fits into the bike frame and provides the bearings that your cranks spin on.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket</a> contains the bearings on which the crankset spins and it fits into your frame.</p>\n<p>Bottom brackets come in many shapes and sizes, but as far as road groupsets are concerned, they all fall into one of two categories: press-fit or threaded.</p>\n<p>Threaded bottom brackets screw into your frame on threads. Press-fit bottom brackets, as the name suggests, are pressed into the frame and held in place by friction.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, press-fit bottom brackets are less convenient than threaded ones when it comes to maintenance and compatibility, but many manufacturers favour them for purported weight and stiffness benefits, as well as ease of manufacturing.</p>\n<h2>What do I get with a more expensive road groupset?</h2>\n<p>Does paying more always bring you improved performance? Maybe, but the higher up the range you go, the smaller those performance benefits become, and the increments become less noticeable, while the kit gets a lot more expensive.</p>\n<p>Second-tier groupsets (Shimano Ultegra, Campagnolo Chorus, SRAM Force) are generally as good in functional terms as the pro-level components and considerably cheaper, but they weigh fractionally more and have fewer exotic shiny bits.</p>\n<h3>Weight</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> More money gets you less weight, for the same or better performance (usually).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It was once famously said of bicycle parts: “Strong. Light. Cheap. Pick two.” A lighter bike will always accelerate and climb better than a heavier one, but without giving up strength, something has to be compromised.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re looking at groupsets, wheels or even complete bikes, reduced weight is often the major contributor to increased cost.</p>\n<p>With all the road groupsets, the more you spend, the lighter they get. The amount of weight that you save for your money diminishes dramatically at the upper end, though.</p>\n<p>These weight differences are the result of more expensive materials and refined, or more time-consuming, manufacturing processes.</p>\n<p>In addition to further machining, hole-drilling and high precision, more expensive components often use materials such as carbon fibre, titanium, lightweight aluminium and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/ceramic-bearings/\">ceramic bearings</a> to achieve the pinnacle in low weight and performance.</p>\n<h3>Durability</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Today’s road groupsets can take all sorts of punishment, even off the tarmac.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you’re spending more money on a groupset, you’d expect it to outlast a cheaper option. Durability does improve with price, but our experience is that durability also plateaus at the second-tier options, and in some ways, actually starts to decline at the most expensive option.</p>\n<p>The more expensive technical components are built with greater precision, refinement and materials that lend themselves to greater longevity. This is apparent in derailleurs and shifters where the cheaper options will develop play and slop over time, while the better parts often remain like new.</p>\n<p>Wear items, such as cassettes and chainrings, however, are often the reverse of this. Cheaper options are made of heavier but more durable steels, while the more expensive versions are sometimes made from lighter but softer aluminium or titanium alloys.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Improved performance is the promise of higher-priced groupsets: smoother, more precise and quicker shifts between gears, stiffer cranks and better braking.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In addition to the benefits of reduced weight, more expensive groupsets find other ways of increasing performance. Most noticeably, higher-priced options provide a smoother, more precise and in some cases quicker shift between gears.</p>\n<p>This includes reduced effort at the lever, something that becomes apparent once you’ve been on the bike for a few hours. It’s an area where electronic gears set the benchmark; ultimate precision at the simple push of a button.</p>\n<p>Another performance example is increased crankset stiffness to provide crisper shifting and more efficient power transfer from the pedals to the rear wheel. This is achieved with more complex designs, and materials that increase strength and stiffness, but don’t add weight.</p>\n<p>Braking raises an entire new list of benefits as prices go up. Simply put, more expensive brakes are stronger, offer better feel and control, and stop you with less hand force required.</p>\n<p>This difference is much more apparent with rim brakes, though. There’s hardly any meaningful performance difference between low- and high-end hydraulic disc brakes.</p>\n<h3>Additional features</h3>\n<p>Besides offering extra gears, the more expensive groupsets usually get new features first.</p>\n<p>Shimano first launched Di2 electronic shifting at the Dura-Ace level, before trickling it down to Ultegra. The same is true of more mundane details – Dura-Ace was the first to get reach adjustment using a built-in screw rather than ugly shims, a feature now found all the way down to Claris level.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Shimano and Campagnolo now offer their higher-end cranksets in a universal size that’s cross-compatible with compact, semi-compact or standard-sized chainrings. This means that if you ever wish to change your chainring sizes, you can do so without needing a new crankset.</p>\n<h2>Groupset compatibility issues</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Watch out for compatibility issues when upgrading individual components.</span></figcaption><span> <i>John Watson / SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>It’s worth being aware that not all groupset components from a given manufacturer are compatible with one another, even in cases where it seems like they should be.</p>\n<p>Manufacturers tend to update their ranges incrementally over time so you can’t always assume, for example, that one 11-speed component will work with another if they’re not from the same year or groupset.</p>\n<p>There are differences in the precise amount of cable pulled by different rim brake levers too, so you may not get optimal performance if you move up the hierarchy when you replace individual parts.</p>\n<p>That said, groupsets of a given brand are generally designed to work with each other, providing they share the same number of gears. (i.e. Shimano 11-speed with Shimano 11-speed, Campagnolo 11-speed with Campagnolo 11-speed.)</p>\n<p>For specific compatibility queries, we’d suggest you ask your local retailer before buying, consult manufacturer technical documents online, or <a href=\"https://forum.bikeradar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">seek advice on our forum</a>.
