By now, the festive cheer of Christmas is long forgotten, the resolution-making zeal of New Year is a distant memory, and while yes, the days are indeed getting longer, it’s still cold and wet outside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to see you through the last bitter clutches of winter’s grasp for another year, why not pick up the latest copy of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine, which as of today is sitting resplendent on newsstands across the country? As we hit the milestone of 150 issues not out, we’ve put together another instalment packed with the rides, climbs and bikes that have been keeping us busy over the past month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And where better to start than with our trip to the volcanic slopes of Tenerife’s Mount Teide in this month’s Big Ride? <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mount-teide-tenerife-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">We’ve been there before</a>, but never like this: Mount Teide is spectacular by road, but even more spectacular off-road, especially against a backdrop of sunshine and endless blue skies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rewind to last July, meanwhile, and neither sunshine nor blue sky could save Tadej Pogačar as his dreams of a third Tour de France victory fell apart on the cruel slopes of the Col de la Loze in the Alps. This month’s Classic Climb sees us make our own pilgrimage to a climb that only gets harder the closer you get to the summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, your progress up any climb will depend greatly on the bike you have underneath you, and once you get to the top, presumably your ride will bring you back down again, with – hopefully – some flat roads either side of it. So what’s the right kind of bike for the job? Do you go for an aero speed machine to cut through the air on the flat, a lightweight climber’s bike for when the gradients start to bite, or an all-rounder to give you the best chance on all terrains? This issue we dive deep into the data on all three, comparing how each performed on a punishing Pyrenean ride in the ultimate bike speed test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in our April issue, we compare two Tuscan classics of a very different sort in Strade Bianche and the Palio horse race, catch up with pro cyclists union president Adam Hansen, get hands on with the EF Education-EasyPost soigneur in the latest in our pro team staff series, and rearrange the ever more convoluted UCI racing calendar so it works better for everyone. You’re welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-150\" target=\"_blank\">Get your issue at the <em>Cyclist</em> shop</a> or <a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe</a> and get every issue delivered free, straight to your door.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/campagnolo-ekar-gt\">Ekar GT brings Campagnolo 13-speed gravel shifting to lower price point</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/audax-stories\">Meet the audaxers</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/does-bike-weight-matter\">Opinion: Weight matters</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 150: on sale now!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"69620444e1297d8d284d6aa8f625e2a5fc70060840ab7c9540693706583daceb","category":"Cycling"}
