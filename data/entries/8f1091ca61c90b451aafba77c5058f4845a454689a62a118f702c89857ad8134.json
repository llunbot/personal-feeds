Later that month, a leaker known as Majin Bu on X also cited a source who claimed that the next iPhone SE will actually be named iPhone 16E.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1891857914849116175\">follow-up post</a> today, Majin Bu cited a source who has apparently seen an iPhone box with the name iPhone 16E on it. In addition, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1890070028013432999\">believes</a> that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-launch-february-19/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook's teaser post</a> about a \"new member of the family\" being announced this Wednesday suggests that the device will indeed have a new name. And last, there are <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Diphone%2B16e\">several Amazon listings</a> for so-called iPhone 16E cases, although that could be guesswork.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Amazon-iPhone-16E.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1934\" height=\"1024\" />\r<br />\nThe device is rumored to feature a larger 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, an A18 chip, a USB-C port, Apple Intelligence support, an Apple-designed 5G modem, and more. Apple should reveal pricing and a release date tomorrow.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16E</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-16e-name-is-likely/\">iPhone 16E Name is Increasingly Likely Instead of iPhone SE 4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-name-is-increasingly-likely-instead-of-iphone-se-4.2449668/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8f1091ca61c90b451aafba77c5058f4845a454689a62a118f702c89857ad8134","category":"Apple"}
