The level of fluid dynamics and engineering discussed is still well above my pay grade, but I think we do a pretty good of of explaining how the new dampers can simultaneously offer more support <em>and</em> be more sensitive to small bumps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s all about pressure balancing, and we go deep on it. If you’ve always run your suspension wide open so it’s as comfortable as possible, you may want to listen in. The new GRIP dampers provide better, faster damping so you have more control with less harshness. And they work phenomenally well. Get ready to geek out!</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<h3><strong>Want More?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Find every episode of the BikeRumor Podcast on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bikerumor-podcast/id1455519558\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6CJD6UAmN9OHfttF4e9lx1\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.podbean.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Podbean</a>, and through <a href=\"https://feed.podbean.com/bikerumor/feed.xml\" target=\"_blank\">RSS</a>, or wherever you listen to podcasts! Hit like, hit subscribe, and hit play!
