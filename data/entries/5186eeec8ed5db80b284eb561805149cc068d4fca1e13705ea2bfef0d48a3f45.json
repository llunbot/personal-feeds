As already noted, Trek says this will shave “around six minutes” off a 180km Kona bike leg.</p>\n<p>Two minutes of those savings are said to come from the reduced rolling resistance Trek claims can be achieved when using its latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/bontrager-aeolus-rsl-51-62-75/\">Aeolus RSL wheels</a> with 75mm deep rims (which, being disc-brake only, weren’t compatible with the old Speed Concept).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Trek says two of the six claimed minutes saved over the course of a 180km Kona bike leg can be attributed to the Bontrager Aeolus RSL wheels.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Trek</i></span></div>\n<p>A move away from the hinge fork design on the old Speed Concept, to a more conventional fork design with a round steerer tube, makes the new Speed Concept less aggressively narrow at the head tube.</p>\n<p>The upshot of this change is the front end of the new Speed Concept is said to be far easier to disassemble for transport (and then reassemble at the other end).</p>\n<p>Trek says most positional adjustments – crucial to getting a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-position/\">bike fit</a> optimised for both comfort and aerodynamics – can be made using only two Allen keys.</p>\n<p>The integrated triathlon bars also feature continually adjustable extensions, meaning extension reach can be altered precisely without the need to cut down any carbon parts.</p>\n<h2>Aero bike packing</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An integrated storage box on the top tube has space for up to eight gels (or whatever ride food you prefer).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Trek</i></span></div>\n<p>With the growing popularity of long-distance triathlons such as Ironman, finding ways to carry food, water and spares on the bike has become a crucial design parameter for bike manufacturers.</p>\n<p>As such, unused space on the top tube, behind the head tube, is dedicated to an integrated food storage box. As well as having enough room inside it to carry eight gels, Trek says it has removable dividers for customising the space, and that it can be removed for easy cleaning.</p>\n<p>Similar to the latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/orbea-ordu-2021/\">Orbea Ordu</a> time trial / triathlon bike, the new Speed Concept also gets a specially designed aero water bottle, with a 700ml capacity, for its down tube.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An integrated aero water bottle on the down tube offers 700ml of fluid-carrying capacity, and Trek says it’s drag neutral.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Trek</i></span></div>\n<p>Trek says this can be used to carry water (or your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/how-to-make-your-own-energy-drinks/\">energy drink</a> mix of choice) with no aerodynamic penalty, unlike standard round <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-water-bottles/\">water bottles</a>, which would increase aerodynamic drag.</p>\n<p>Rather than using an aero-optimised storage box on the outside of the frame, though, the new Speed Concept hides spares (such as a multi-tool, spare inner tube, tyre levers and a CO2 inflator) inside the down tube, underneath the aero bottle.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Spares and tools can be hidden away inside the down tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Trek</i></span></div>\n<p>Trek has also developed a new Between-The-Arms (BTA) bottle (available separately) for the Speed Concept, offering an additional 700ml of fluid storage. It’s refillable on the go, via an accessible port on the top of the bottle, and includes a straw to allow riders to drink from it without leaving the aero position.</p>\n<p>According to Trek, a BTA bottle such as this “is the fastest place to store water”, assuming it works with your bike fit (you’ll need to have enough space between your forearms to accommodate it).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Trek says the optional Between-The-Arms (BTA) bottle is the fastest way for triathletes to stay hydrated on the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Trek</i></span></div>\n<h2>IsoSpeed</h2>\n<p>Comfort is something not often associated with time trial or triathlon bikes, but when you’re looking at a 180km bike ride followed by a marathon run (and preceded by a 2.4-mile swim, because why not?), it’s obvious being more comfortable is likely to improve performance.</p>\n<p>On the new Speed Concept, the IsoSpeed comfort-enhancing decoupler technology is integrated into the seat tube / top tube junction, with a “forward pivot optimised for a triathlete’s weight bias” (which tends to be more over the front wheel compared to road bikes such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/2021-trek-madone-slr-project-one/\">Trek Madone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/trek-domane-sl6-review/\">Domane</a>).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Trek has now added its IsoSpeed decoupler system to its triathlon bike, at the seat tube / top tube junction.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Trek</i></span></div>\n<h2>Trek Speed Concept Geometry</h2>\n<p>There are two versions of the new Speed Concept frameset; the Speed Concept SLR and the Speed Concept TT.</p>\n<p>Both versions of the frameset can be used in UCI-sanctioned events, but Trek says the triathlon-specific base bar on the Speed Concept SLR would need to be replaced with a UCI-legal version.</p>\n<p>The Speed Concept TT differs from the SLR version by forgoing the IsoSpeed system and integrated storage solutions. It also has a “slightly tweaked geometry for a little more nimbleness”, making it a better fit for the shorter, more technical time trials typically found in professional road races such as the <a

a slightly modified geometry to the Speed Concept SLR, with shallower head tube angles across the size range and a shallower seat tube angle of 76 degrees (compared to 78 degrees on the Speed Concept SLR).</p>\n<p>The latter may be intended to make it easier for riders to comply with the UCI’s technical regulations, which dictate the tip of a rider’s saddle must be at least 5cm behind the centre of the bottom bracket (unless a “morphological exemption” is granted by the UCI).</p>\n<div>\n
