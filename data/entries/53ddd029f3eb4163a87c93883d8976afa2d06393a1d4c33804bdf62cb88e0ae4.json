Apple doesn't sell the USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case separately, so if you want USB-C support you'll have to purchase a full new set of earbuds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe've begun tracking all of the season's best deals in our dedicated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/black-friday/\">Black Friday Roundup</a>, so be sure to bookmark the page and visit it throughout the season as you do your online shopping.
