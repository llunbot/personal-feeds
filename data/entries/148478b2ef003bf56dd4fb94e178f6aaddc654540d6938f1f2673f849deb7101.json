A plethora of sports held their championships at the same time to draw increased attention and audiences, with cycling joining athletics, swimming, gymnastics, rowing and more sporting disciplines in events mainly held across Glasgow and Berlin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cycling itself was split between two countries. The junior and U23 events actually took place in the Czech Republic but the elite events were held in Scotland. This was the inaugural European Cycling Championships too, bringing together the disciplines of road, track, mountain biking and BMX.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Road</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Remco-Evenepoel-European-Champion.jpg-2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Remco-Evenepoel-European-Champion.jpg-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Remco-Evenepoel-European-Champion.jpg-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Remco-Evenepoel-European-Champion.jpg-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Remco-Evenepoel-European-Champion.jpg-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Remco-Evenepoel-European-Champion.jpg-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Remco-Evenepoel-European-Champion.jpg-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Remco-Evenepoel-European-Champion.jpg-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Remco-Evenepoel-European-Champion.jpg-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Remco-Evenepoel-European-Champion.jpg-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Remco-Evenepoel-European-Champion.jpg-2.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Cycling Photo LIV</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In Brno, Czech Republic, a rider every cycling fan is now familiar with was taking his first steps to make a name for himself after <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/remco-evenepoel-football\" target=\"_blank\">switching from football</a> to cycling. A young <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> won the junior road race for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/belgium\" target=\"_blank\">Belgium</a> by over nine minutes after an almost 100km solo breakaway. Even more impressively, it came just two days after he won time-trial gold, beating fellow countryman Ilan van Wilder by 24 seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the senior men’s road race in Glasgow, a five-man group formed in the breakaway after a crash in the final kilometres: Matteo Trentin and Davide Cimolai (Italy), <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu van der Poel</a> (Netherlands), <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a> (Belgium) and Jesús Herrada (Spain). Trentin managed to outsprint them all on the wet city circuit for his first win after fracturing his spine in a crash at Paris-Roubaix earlier in the season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the women’s race, Italy’s Marta Bastianelli beat Dutch defending champion <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2022-stage-2-gallery-marianne-vos\" target=\"_blank\">Marianne Vos</a> just as she had done a year prior at the World Championships in Germany. It was a day to remember for 19-year-old Sophie Wright of Great Britain too, having gone on a 40km solo attack after two heart operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellen van Dijk, meanwhile, won her third of fourth consecutive time-trial golds for the Netherlands, narrowly edging out countrywoman Anna van der Breggen by just two seconds.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n
