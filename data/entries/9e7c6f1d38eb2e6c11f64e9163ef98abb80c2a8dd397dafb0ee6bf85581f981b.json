It allows users to create personalized \"Memory Movies\" from their photo libraries using simple written prompts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBy leveraging advanced machine learning, the memory maker identifies relevant photos and videos, arranges them into a cohesive narrative, and pairs them with curated music and animations. One standout aspect of the new memory maker is its ability to weave together moments with a beginning, middle, and end, creating a narrative that is designed to feel intentional and cinematic. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike other ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features, the memory maker is only available on iPhones and iPads with the A17 Pro or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip or newer.
