{"title":"Apple’s years-long 5G modem project might finally release in 2025","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2409083/apple-5g-modem-iphone-17-slim-se-2025-release.html","date":1721922674000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>2025 is shaping up to be a landmark year for the iPhone. Apple could release a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2407898/report-iphone-17-slim-will-emphasize-design-over-features-and-specs.html\">new model that could sport a new design approach</a> and possibly <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">update the iPhone SE</a>, and those two phones could feature another new chip. According to an <a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1816132182039232624\">X post by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the slim iPhone 17 and the iPhone SE 4 could feature a 5G modem made by Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Apple is accelerating its move away from reliance on Qualcomm,” Kuo wrote. “In 2025, two new iPhone models will ditch Qualcomm’s 5G chips and adopt Apple’s in-house 5G chips: the iPhone SE4 (1Q25) and the ultra-slim iPhone 17 (3Q25).” Why just those two models? So Apple can effectively test the modem on a large scale without shipping it in every new iPhone. The SE and iPhone 17 Slim will likely be far less popular than other 2025 models (iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max), so any issues will be easier to address. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://t.co/HHQr6EZL12\">https://t.co/HHQr6EZL12</a></p>— 郭明錤 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1816132182039232624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 24, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div><figcaption>Clicking the link in the post above will take you to the full article that Ming-Chi Kuo posted.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, most users don’t really care about the modem the iPhone has, only that it works. But it’s significant in that Apple finally appears to be getting a payoff from its billion-dollar <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233067/apple-confirms-that-it-will-acquire-most-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business.html\">purchase of Intel’s modem business exactly five years ago today</a>. Since the purchase, reports say that the project has had its issues, and there was even a report last year that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157698/apple-5g-modem-scrapped-rumor.html\">Apple finally gave up</a>. But it looks like it could finally happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualcomm’s modems work well, so why would Apple even bother making its own? Apple has a history of controlling as much as it can of its product development, and by developing its own modem, it can design it to fit its desired specs exactly and can stop making iPhone design accommodations for a Qualcomm modem. Plus it’s obviously cheaper to use in-house parts rather than licensing them from another company.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9bbf1271282a2ebebb2422fc118885d1e35d8fa04da3ba166466811957085ebf","category":"Apple"}
