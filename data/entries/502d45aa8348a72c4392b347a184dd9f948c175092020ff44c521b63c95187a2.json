If you change your Service address or Service Plan at a later date, you may be charged the congestion fee.\"</p>\n<p>The charge is unwelcome for anyone wanting Starlink service in a congested area, but it could help prevent the capacity crunch from getting worse by making people think twice about signing up. The SpaceX-owned Internet service provider also seems to anticipate that people who sign up for service in congested areas may change their minds after trying it out for a few weeks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051360#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051360&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"502d45aa8348a72c4392b347a184dd9f948c175092020ff44c521b63c95187a2","category":"Tech"}
