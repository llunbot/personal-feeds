It fits like a second skin without feeling tight.</p>\n<p>Fine mesh front and side panels are cool, wick well and help with aerodynamics, while the grid-patterned rear does a top job of shifting sweat.</p>\n<p>The smooth fabric arms are not as long as some and feature raw ends with silicone bands that hold them in place. All critical seams are bonded, keeping weight and bulk down.</p>\n<p>The low-cut neck sits well and does away with the need for a zip garage. The simple three-pocket setup is in keeping with the minimalist design, but they do sit a little higher than some. Hot-weather performance is right up there and the stylish Pro SL Lite punches above its price tag.</p>\n<p>Those looking for a women’s-specific option might consider Endura’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/jerseys/endura-wms-pt-wave-s-s-jersey-limited-edition-review/\" target=\"_blank\">WMS PT Wave S/S Jersey Limited Edition jersey</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Giro Chrono Expert</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The main body material wicks sweat and offers a UPF 30+ rating.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Sizes:</strong> S–2XL</li>\n<li><strong>Colours:</strong> Iceberg Horizon, Bright Red, True Spruce</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £80 / AU$130 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Giro Chrono Expert jersey feels classy and is very hard to fault. It does everything very well, from the understated but striking visual design of the Iceberg Horizon tested here to the reflective details.</p>\n<p>The renewable polyester/elastane blend boasts a fine mix of stretch and form-fitting (not to mention eco credentials), aided by sleeves that sit gracefully on the arms and an efficient elasticated silicone hem. This feels like it’ll fit a wide array of body shapes.</p>\n<p>The full-length underarm mesh panels do their breathability business, while the main body material wicks sweat and offers a UPF 30+ rating. Giro has also nailed the pockets business, offering three rear compartments and a sizeable, secure (but not water-resistant) zipped pocket that easily holds a phone.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the zipper can sometimes become caught in the garage and the 175g weight makes it fairly heavy.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Scott RC Pro Supersonic</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Worth noting is that Scott bills this as an XC (cross-country) jersey.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Sizes:</strong> S–XXL</li>\n<li><strong>Colours:</strong> Black/Drift Purple</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £90 / €100 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The RC Pro is a pro-level jersey at a sub-£100 price. There are loads of smart touches, from the sleek, elasticated waist hem and arm grippers that subtly hold everything in place to the lightweight 85 per cent polyester/15 per cent elastane material that offers unrivalled stretch and fabric-on-skin comfort.</p>\n<p>The lack of a zipper garage is an easily avoided flaw and the water-repellent pocket is too small for a phone but is handy for cards and cash. The three open rear pockets do the business in terms of stashing fuel and spares and are easy to access on the fly.</p>\n<p>Despite the ‘pro’ level billing, this jersey feels flattering in terms of fit and design, and the ridged texture on the material and close fit suggest aero benefits. Breathability via the fabric and the large, open-mesh panels under the arms also perform in the ventilation stakes.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that Scott bills this as an XC (cross-country) jersey, but there aren’t really any differences to a road jersey and it excels on the asphalt.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Sportful Monocrom Jersey</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A chic and high-performing summer jersey at a good price.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robert Smith / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Sizes:</strong> S–XXXL</li>\n<li><strong>Colours:</strong> Anthracite, Black, Blue Atomic, Coconut, Dry Green, Sea Moss</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £90 / $150 / €100 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>We love the simplicity yet high function of this lightweight jersey. Sportful achieves the unique colour finish by creating a white jersey before dipping it into different colour dyes to achieve the final shade. As a consequence, every jersey is a one-off with all the component parts taking the dye differently. This gives it a neat, aged finish for a less race-inspired look.</p>\n<p>The high-stretch mesh panels wick well and fit true to size, offering a more forgiving fit than some of Sportful’s race kit.</p>\n<p>We liked the overall cut, with long sleeves and wide, raw-finish arm ends, low neck and a wide silicone-lined hem, all delivering a comfy fit. The three rear pockets are perfectly located and offer ample storage. A chic and high-performing summer jersey at a good price.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sportful.com/us/monocrom-w-jersey/p/110203520P-587\" target=\"_blank\">Monocrom W Jersey</a> is the women’s-specific version.

If so, a properly fitted cycling jersey is going to serve you best.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Fitted cycling jerseys, like this Superlight jersey by Katusha, are ideal for cyclists who want to ride fast in hot weather.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Yogamaya von Hippel / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you’re more interested in taking it easy and staying casual, or you’re looking to stop off in shops and towns mid-ride, then there’s nothing wrong with wearing your normal clothes, or a mix of cycling-specific clothes and non-cycling-specific clothes.</p>\n<p>Just be mindful that if it rains or you get sweaty, everyday clothes aren’t designed to be as breathable or quick-drying as cycling-specific kit.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s nothing wrong with mixing and matching cycling kit with normal clothes, if that’s more your cup of tea.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<h3>Fit, fabrics and aerodynamics</h3>\n<p>It’s well established that tight, close-fitting kit is more aerodynamically efficient than loose, baggy clothing. It’s been proven in the wind tunnel, but it’s also easy enough to test yourself – just go out in a baggy top, the increased air resistance is obvious.</p>\n<p>What’s less well known is that both the type of fabric and the placement of seams can also have an effect on the aerodynamic efficiency of cycling jerseys.</p>\n<p>These jerseys are often more complex and expensive to design and manufacture than standard jerseys though, so you’ll likely need to cough up some extra cash to get your hands on them.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/jerseys/rapha-souplesse-aero-womens-jersey-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Souplesse Aero Women’s Jersey by Rapha</a> is a great example. It performs excellently, but the price is accordingly high.</p>\n<p>They arguably represent a good value performance upgrade though, because aero jerseys can have a relatively large effect on how aerodynamic you are but cost much less than <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">aero road bikes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/10-of-the-best-deep-aero-wheels-lab-tested/\" target=\"_blank\">aero wheels</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to find out more about the benefits of aero jerseys check out our article that asks <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tunnel-testing-clothing-pearl-izumis-ongoing-aero-design/\" target=\"_blank\">how much faster are aero jerseys?</a></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Both wind tunnel and real-world testing have proven that tight-fitting jerseys help minimise aerodynamic drag.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>On the other hand, if you’re not fussed about optimising your aerodynamic efficiency, a light looser jersey might be more comfortable and offer a little more breathability in hot weather.</p>\n<p>Just be wary when sizing up that if a jersey is too big for you, the rear pockets might sag a bit when full of stuff.</p>\n<p>Other than the fact that it doesn’t look amazing, it’s not a huge problem, but it will likely make the pockets a bit harder to reach while riding.</p>\n<h3>How much money do I need to spend on a cycling jersey?</h3>\n<p>It depends on your goals. Lower priced jerseys tend to be perfectly functional but are most often targeted at non-racers, so if you’re looking for a very tight fit you may need to size down.</p>\n<p>Higher priced jerseys have usually been subject to more in-depth research and development, possibly using wind tunnel or real-world testing to refine the fit and aerodynamics. You may also get more advanced fabrics with features such as protection from UV rays.</p>\n<p>Styling also tends to improve as the price increases because premium brands invest more in design, but this is obviously subjective so we’ll leave it up to you to make the ultimate call on that.</p>\n<h3>Replica kits and funky cycling jerseys, hot or not?</h3>\n<p>Unlike other sports, cycling has a curiously muted relationship with amateurs wearing replica pro team kits.</p>\n<p>The traditional idea was that you’re supposed to have <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pro-team-kit-hot-or-not/\" target=\"_blank\">earned the right to wear a professional team kit</a>, by literally becoming a professional. The reality probably has more to do with the fact that many cycling teams aren’t location-based, and don’t tend to stick around for long enough to generate a loyal following of fans who might wish to buy such kit.</p>\n<p>It’s also perhaps fair to say that professional cycling jerseys, often covered in gaudy brand logos as they are, aren’t always the most stylish option for many.</p>\n<p>For some though, pro team kit can be a way to show off their appreciation for the more obscure side of our wonderful sport.</p>\n<p>It might come as no surprise then that at BikeRadar we do love <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/retro-cycling-jerseys/\">retro cycling jerseys</a>.</p>\n<p>Once these designs have aged enough to be retro, they’re also a surefire way to prove your knowledge of cycling history.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The full-Euro-fluoro look, made possible by the 2015 Tinkoff-Saxo pro team kit (by Sportful), is quite the fashion flex for those bold enough to try it.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The wearing of world champions or race leaders jerseys, like the famous <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tour-de-france-jersey-colours-and-prize-money-a-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">Yellow, Green and Polka Dot jerseys of the Tour de France</a> is similarly contentious. Like with pro team kit, it’s often argued these jerseys should be reserved for racers who have ‘earned’ the right to wear them.</p>\n<p>If you’ve been inspired by a hero who’s worn these jerseys, and wearing one makes you feel a little bit special, then don’t let anyone hold you back.</p>\n<p>Tacky holiday jerseys (<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tacky-holiday-cycling-jerseys/\" target=\"_blank\">yes, they are a thing</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/foska-heinz-tomato-ketchup-jersey-first-look/\" target=\"_blank\">other novelty jerseys</a> also hold a well-established place in our sport.
