To that end, we decided to put DeepSeek's R1 model up against OpenAI's ChatGPT models in the style of our <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/12/chatgpt-vs-google-bard-round-2-how-does-the-new-gemini-model-fare/\">previous showdowns</a> between <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/clash-of-the-ai-titans-chatgpt-vs-bard-in-a-showdown-of-wits-and-wisdom/\">ChatGPT and Google Bard/Gemini</a>.</p>\n<p>This was not designed to be a test of the hardest problems possible; it's more of a sample of everyday questions these models might get asked by users.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-does-deepseek-r1-really-fare-against-openais-best-reasoning-models/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-does-deepseek-r1-really-fare-against-openais-best-reasoning-models/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"54944662927a4d52e6a0fd8f0929e024b4873a49346f4996d279e3310117b476","category":"Tech"}
