You’ll have to pay for that accuracy though, as the dual-sided system costs £1,500 and is said to be available from June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Body Rocket, the brand that developed the eponymous real-time direct drag force aero measurement system, the pedals use a sample rate of 20Hz, which is higher than any competitor and how it is able to achieve its accuracy claims. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pedals are compatible with all ANT+ enabled <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-computers-gps-computers-for-training-navigation-and-data\" target=\"_blank\">head units</a>. With ANT+ sample rates limited to 1Hz, in order to examine the entirety of the data, riders will need to connect to the proprietary Body Rocket app. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"637\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/image-4-970x637.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/image-4-970x637.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/image-4-300x197.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/image-4-768x504.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/image-4-750x492.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/image-4.png 1112w\" /><figcaption><em>JustJames Media</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Body Rocket says the Silverstone Sports Engineering Hub, in the absence of a standardised power meter accuracy test, tried to discover <a href=\"https://www.bodyrocket.cc/blog/understanding-the-precision-and-reliability-of-the-body-rocket-power-meter-system\" target=\"_blank\">which was the most accurate</a>. Subsequently, it has been using the Body Rocket pedals on its own pedalling efficiency rig as they came out on top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Body Rocket says it was driven to develop its own power measurement system as other systems on the market weren’t accurate enough. In recent years, accuracy has been viewed as ‘good enough’ at around +/-1% and the focus has been on bringing down cost. Body Rocket’s new product may signal a trend in other direction however, with prices rising in exchange for more accurate power data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pedals are rechargeable via magnetic cable, and have a claimed 40-hour run time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pair of SPD-SL compatible pedals weigh a claimed 370g and have a standard 53mm spindle, meaning stance width isn’t affected, unlike other pedal-based power meter systems. The pedals will cost £1,500 and orders will be fulfilled in June 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More information can be found at <a href=\"https://www.bodyrocket.cc/product/power-meter\" target=\"_blank\">bodyrocket.cc</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-heart-rate-monitors\">Best heart rate monitors 2025 reviewed for cycling</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/aero-lightweight-all-rounder-fastest-road-bike\">Aero vs lightweight vs all-rounder: which is the fastest road bike?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-power-meters-cycling\">Best power meters 2025: Watts the fuss</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/body-rocket-more-speed-for-less-effort\">Body Rocket: more speed for less effort</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/body-rocket-power-meter\">Aero monitor company Body Rocket launches ‘+/-0.1% accurate’ dual-sided power meter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Laurence Kilpatrick &#124;
