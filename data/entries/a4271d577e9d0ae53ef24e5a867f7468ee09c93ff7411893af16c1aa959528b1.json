Apple has agreed to pay our nearly $100 million to settle a proposed class action lawsuit over Siri’s ability to “listen to, record, and share their conversations” without consent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16027233/lopez-v-apple-inc/\">Lopez v. Apple</a> suit, which was filed in 2019, the plaintiffs allege that Apple’s Siri-enabled devices both listened to conversations due to “accidental activations” and shared the contents with advertisers. Examples in the suit include Air Jordan sneakers, Pit Viper sunglasses, and a specific surgical treatment, all of which allegedly resulted in targeted ads on their devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lawsuit covers a decade of devices, from September 2014 to December 2024 and seemingly includes iPhones, Apple Watches, and any other device with “Hey Siri” capabilities. As it the case with class-action settlements, Apple has denied any wrongdoing in agreeing to the terms of the settlement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The $95 million figure is relatively low, especially since it also includes legal fees, while likely top $30 million. For example, the class-action suit over the iPhone 6 battery issue, resulted in a $500 million settlement, which resulted in an average payout of $65 per person across 3 million claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At any rate, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-pay-95-million-settle-siri-privacy-lawsuit-2025-01-02/\">Reuters reports</a> class members may receive up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, but that will be dependent on the terms of the settlement, which haven’t been disclosed.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a4271d577e9d0ae53ef24e5a867f7468ee09c93ff7411893af16c1aa959528b1","category":"Apple"}
