Well, winter has <em>officially </em>come and we all know in the UK that don't just mean cold, it's wet too.</p>\n<p>Thankfully Giro has released its new XNetic H20 accessories: socks, shoe covers and gloves, all waterproof but breathable to combat the worst of the conditions.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/in_the_drops_giro_xnetic_h20_1.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>I'm a big fan of the gloves as they're thick enough to keep your hands warm and dry while not being too bulky so you can't feel your brake levers.</p>\n<p>The shoe covers are really easy to get on because they're built like a sock but with extra protection and cleat and heel holes on the under side as well as a reflective strip around the top. At first the socks feel a bit weird due to the waterproofing but they're comfortable, warm and dry so that's all that matters.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy the <a href=\"https://www.giro.co.uk/cycling-c45/clothing-c49/giro-xnetic-h2o-socks-p1892\" target=\"_blank\">socks (£34.99)</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Buy the <a href=\"https://www.giro.co.uk/cycling-c45/accessories-c50/giro-xnetic-h2o-shoe-covers-p1893\" target=\"_blank\">shoe covers (£59.99)</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Buy the <a href=\"https://www.giro.co.uk/cycling-c45/gloves-c51/mens-c59/giro-xnetic-h2o-gloves-p1894\" target=\"_blank\">gloves (£49.99)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Africap cap</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/in_the_drops_africap_1.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Fact: cyclists love cycling caps. Fact: fun designs make for superior cycling caps. These things make Africap's caps as good as they come.</p>\n<p>They're all made with Ankara printed fabric – 100% cotton – from West Africa and each one is named after the specific region where the fabric was sourced or has an affiliation to. This one is the Abuja, with the material coming from Nigeria.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/in_the_drops_africap_4.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Alongside its obvious aesthetic qualities – it also looks good peak-down but this picture of me was better – it's extra comfortable and the bill is soft rather than the snappy plastic normally used, which is a nice change and makes it a bit more versatile for different head shapes.</p>\n<p>Africap is a small business run by Mohammed 'Hammer' Sesay, who balances it with working in international human rights and running charity <a href=\"https://www.keepitfax.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Keep it FAX</a> – which helps children in Sierra Leone by providing scholarships, improving schools, helping orphans find foster arrangements and more.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.africap-apparel.com/store\" target=\"_blank\">Africap (£23)</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Learn more about Mohammed Sesay on the <a href=\"https://www.eazyliving.net/blogs/2021/11/9/mohammed-sesay-how-to-do-good-while-having-fun\" target=\"_blank\">Eazy Spotlight podcast</a>.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Giordana G-Shield thermal kit</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/in_the_drops_giordana_g-shield_1.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>While socks, gloves and shoe covers keep your hands and feet warm and dry, what about the rest of the body? The new Giordana G-Shield winter kit will do that job very handily.</p>\n<p>It has a thermal lining for a comfortable fit that doesn't lose the aerodynamics of a classic jersey and has a hydrophobic coating to keep the rain out.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/in_the_drops_giordana_g-shield_2.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>I struggle with many thermal bibtights as they can feel too thick and restrictive but the G-Shield tights are legwarmer-thin while being warm and comfortable.

Finding a lock that will not only keep thieves out but is easy to travel with is tricky.</p>\n<p>The latest release from Litelok is the Core, which has a Diamond(!) Sold Secure rating, so you can't find a better lock for both deterrent, and protection if thieves aren't deterred.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/in_the_drops_litelok_core_2.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>It's also flexible and can be worn around your waist thanks to the elastic attachment that allows for a secure and pretty comfortable fit – make sure you wear it with the elastic strap behind you for optimum comfort.</p>\n<p>It is big, as you'd imagine from a properly secure lock, but it's reasonably light, starting at 1.9kg and feels lighter than that when you're wearing it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.tweekscycles.com/uk/litelok-core-bike-lock-4000198/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweeks Cycles (from £119.99)</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>For more information visit <a href=\"https://www.litelok.com/products/litelok-core\" target=\"_blank\">litelok.com</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Read our guide to the </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/690/buyers-guide-choosing-the-best-bike-lock\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>best bike locks on the market</strong> </a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we're into this week: David O'Doherty and playlist two</h2>\n<p>I promised in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/10222/lemond-prolog-ebike\" target=\"_blank\">my last In the Drops</a> that I would do a playlist of new music each time I was on duty, so here goes.</p>\n<p>I've been very fortunate in that some <em>huge </em>albums have been released in that time so this edition features songs from Adele, Silk Sonic, Courtney Barnett and Snail Mail – who was featured last time but the album came out afterwards – as well as two new songs from Wet Leg and Holly Humberstone and a Christmas charity cover by Phoebe Bridgers.</p>\n<p>The headlines for this playlist are the new single from Wallice, who makes music that will instantly place you in an American indie movie, and two songs from <em>Absolutely </em>by Dijon, which features 12 short but really good tracks that blend soul, hip-hop and indie rock.</p>\n<p>There's also a beautiful new song by Alt-J that is the best they've made for a <em>long </em>time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1ze0bw1wVxNFOp4GIwVAr8?si=b716d48522394752\" target=\"_blank\">In the Drops #2 on Spotify</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nFinally, my recommendation this week couldn't have been easier and I couldn't be more confident about its success.</p>\n<p>Last week saw the start of <em>Along</em><em> for the Ride with David O'Doherty </em>on Channel 4, a show that sees incredibly funny comedian and keen cyclist David O'Doherty go on some of the most scenic bike rides in the UK with celebrities.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Join <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phlaimeaux?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@phlaimeaux</a> as he and some famous faces hop on their bikes and take to the open road. <br /><br />%uD83D%uDEB2 Along For The Ride, starts Monday 10pm<br /><br />Ep 1 %u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichardAyoade?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RichardAyoade</a> | Dungeness<br />Ep 2 %u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Alan_Measles?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Alan_Measles</a> | Brecon Beacons<br />Ep 3 %u2013 Mel Giedroyc | Northumberland<br />Ep 4 %u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gillinghamjoe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@gillinghamjoe</a> | Suffolk <a href=\"https://t.co/IfllbJirGk\">pic.twitter.com/IfllbJirGk</a></p>\n<p>— Channel 4 (@Channel4) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Channel4/status/1461639134351613956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 19, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Two episodes have aired so far, the first was a ride to Dungeness in Kent with Richard Ayoade and the second with Grayson Perry in the Brecon Beacons, both were fun, easy watching and very jealousy-inducing.</p>\n<p>It features O'Doherty's beautiful <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/bianchi\" target=\"_blank\">Bianchi</a> bike and kit from <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pocsports.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Poc</a> and Scottish brand <a href=\"https://meanderapparel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Meander</a> as well as a really nice playlist.</p>\n<p>You can find it on <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/along-for-the-ride-with-david-odoherty\" target=\"_blank\">All4</a> and new episodes air on Mondays at 10pm. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d14a937df60641fbdca950b76e2106d23d68decc29de967d3c293c5cd5b6782a","category":"Cycling"}
