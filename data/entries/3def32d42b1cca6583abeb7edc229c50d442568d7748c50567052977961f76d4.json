It’s hard to go past your frame triangle as an ideal place to carry stuff; heavy things don’t alter your bike’s center of gravity, and there’s no need to fuss about with racks. No bottle cages? No worries! Forres is bladder compatible with hydration hose port on the non-drive side.</em> <span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_006.jpg?fit=1200,1500&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_006.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_006.jpg?resize=1200,900&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_006.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_006.jpg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_005.jpg?fit=1200,1500&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_005.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_005.jpg?resize=1200,900&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_005.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_005.jpg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Forres has a double zipper that offers two separate compartments, or fold down the floor for a large single space. Two internal mesh pockets help you organise your smaller items, like phones and snacks. The elastic lacing at the top isn’t just for looks; we all know zips have a finite life span here the elastic helps take the strain off the zipper for increased longevity.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_004.jpg?fit=1200,1500&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_004.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_004.jpg?resize=1200,900&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_004.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/wizard_works_forres_full_frame_bag_004.jpg?resize=1536,1152&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The Forres Full Frame Bag is designed with steel gravel-ish bikes in mind, think slightly sloping top tube, like Fairlight Faran/Secan, Soma Wolverine, Brother Mehteh etc. Available in four sizes, Wizard Works have put together a <a href=\"https://www.wizard.works/product-information/forres-full-frame-bag-fit-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">comprehensive fit guide</a> complete with printable templates so you can see how the bag will fit on your ride.</p>\n<p>Wizard Works’ frame bag range already consists of a very popular <a href=\"https://www.wizard.works/shop/bags/bike-bags/framebagracadabra/\" target=\"_blank\">Partial Frame Bag</a> ready to buy in 4 sizes, but if you’re after a full frame bag before now the only way was <a href=\"https://www.wizard.works/shop/bags/bike-bags/bespoke-frame-bag/\" target=\"_blank\">via a Bespoke made to spec</a> service available in limited quantities and only in the Wizard’s off season.</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small £165/ € 195 / $179</li>\n<li>Medium £165/ € 195 / $179</li>\n<li>Large £175 / € 210 / $190</li>\n<li>X-Large £175 / € 210 /190</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Volume</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small 5L</li>\n<li>Medium 6.5L</li>\n<li>Large 7.8L</li>\n<li>X-Large 9.5L</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weight</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small 310g</li>\n<li>Medium 360g</li>\n<li>Large 400g</li>\n<li>X-Large 450g</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.wizard.works/shop/bags/bike-bags/forres-full-frame-bag/\" target=\"_blank\">Wizard Works</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/wizard-works-forres-full-frame-bag/\">Wizard Works Forres Full Frame Bag</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"3def32d42b1cca6583abeb7edc229c50d442568d7748c50567052977961f76d4","category":"Cycling"}
