This week we’re taking on a frequently used jargon term associated with full suspension mountain bike design: Brake Jack. You’ll see it used all over, from manufacturers’ press releases to mountain bike reviews, and of course, in the much-loved comments section of aforementioned bike reviews. But, what exactly is it, and does it bare any relevance on the more definable and, importantly, quantifiable anti-rise number?&nbsp;</p><p>Answering your questions this week are a handful of full suspension mountain bike frame designers, all of whom will have considered anti-rise values, and possibly brake jack too, during the design of the suspension layout. Some of them have even gone so far as to add a floating brake arm to their bikes in an effort to control the braking characteristics.

I don’t know whose idea it was to put this into bike jargon. It’s not a term that’s used in French either and there is no accurate translation for this expression in cycling.

Brake jack is a resulting force in the suspension that comes from the caliper. In practice it is a force that gets transmitted to the shock but it is not the main force at play.</p><p>Anti-rise is expressed as a ratio of forces. The anti-rise method allows us to take into account the force of rider mass acceleration and the angle at which the load is transferred at the wheel. It is part of kinematic simulation and is considered with many other factors when positioning pivots (shock type, geometry, leverage ratios, axle path, pedaling characteristics).</p><div id=\"attachment_271230\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12011246/Devinci-Spartan-HP-angle.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-271230\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12011246/Devinci-Spartan-HP-angle.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci Spartan HP, angle\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12011246/Devinci-Spartan-HP-angle.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12011246/Devinci-Spartan-HP-angle-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12011246/Devinci-Spartan-HP-angle-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12011246/Devinci-Spartan-HP-angle-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-271230\">The new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/devincis-new-spartan-hp-enduro-bike-adopts-high-pivot-suspension-for-2022/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Devinci Spartan</a> enduro bike utilizes a High-Pivot adaptation of their split-pivot suspension platform</p></div><p>Anti-rise assumes a lot of parameters such as the chain is completely slack when braking, specific fork position, rider position (for the Center of Gravity at which the acceleration is applied). In practice, we shift our weight depending on these variables.</p><p>Ultimately, the objective is the same for both: minimize the effect of caliper force and weight transfer under braking while keeping an active suspension. This is what we strive to do with our Split Pivot platform, whether it be in it’s “normal” form or with our new High-Pivot suspension platform.</p><p><strong>Starling Cycles:</strong> In simple terms, anti-rise is how weight shift (from acceleration and deceleration) affects suspension.&nbsp; Brake Jack is how braking forces affect suspension. All suspension designs have these effects in differing amounts.</p><p>Starling cycles suspension design has anti-rise as close to neutral through the full suspension stroke. Brake Jack is similar to other designs. Best advice with regards to braking, is do it in the right place. This will make you way better than any suspension design can, or claim to improve.</p><p><strong>Does brake jack only occur when the rear wheel stops completely, as in when the caliper locks onto the rotor?</strong></p><p><strong>Eminent Cycles:</strong> Brake jack/anti-rise events occur when the brakes are applied with or without locking up the rear wheel. As soon as braking forces are applied to the rear wheel, during a braking event, the anti-rise situation analysis applies.</p><div id=\"attachment_235259\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eminent-Onset-29-enduro-mountain-bike-long-travel-fox-38-3.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-235259\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eminent-Onset-29-enduro-mountain-bike-long-travel-fox-38-3.jpg\" alt=\"eminent onset floating brake mount\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eminent-Onset-29-enduro-mountain-bike-long-travel-fox-38-3.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eminent-Onset-29-enduro-mountain-bike-long-travel-fox-38-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eminent-Onset-29-enduro-mountain-bike-long-travel-fox-38-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eminent-Onset-29-enduro-mountain-bike-long-travel-fox-38-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eminent-Onset-29-enduro-mountain-bike-long-travel-fox-38-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eminent-Onset-29-enduro-mountain-bike-long-travel-fox-38-3-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eminent-Onset-29-enduro-mountain-bike-long-travel-fox-38-3-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eminent-Onset-29-enduro-mountain-bike-long-travel-fox-38-3-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-235259\">The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/eminent-onset-mt-finally-lands-with-29-wheels-revised-afs-suspension-fox-38-suspension/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eminent Onset</a> enduro bike runs a floating brake caliper, with the chainstay mounted portion allowed to slide forwards and backwards as the bike is pushed through its rear wheel travel</p></div><p><strong>Devinci:</strong> Brake jack is a force and therefore it occurs as soon as the caliper hits the rotor (braking force is applied), even if the caliper is not locked. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Commencal: </strong>I still don’t know what brake jack is! (There’s so much information about it, it’s very confusing).<br>However, it is certainly wise to study the braking behavior of a bike according to the braking torque applied. My advice is to pay maximum attention to the distribution of braking power, because for a large majority of riders, it is 80% rear brake that is used. This leads to imbalances in the chassis, issues with rider weight distribution, poor behavior of the rear suspension and therefore, quite often punctures or dents to the rims.</p><div id=\"attachment_281101\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/17092321/myriam-nicole-commenca-prototype-anti-brake-jack-arm.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-281101\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/17092321/myriam-nicole-commenca-prototype-anti-brake-jack-arm.jpg\" alt=\"myriam nicole prototype commencal downhill bike flating brake caliper minimizing brake jack\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/17092321/myriam-nicole-commenca-prototype-anti-brake-jack-arm.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/17092321/myriam-nicole-commenca-prototype-anti-brake-jack-arm-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/17092321/myriam-nicole-commenca-prototype-anti-brake-jack-arm-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/17092321/myriam-nicole-commenca-prototype-anti-brake-jack-arm-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/17092321/myriam-nicole-commenca-prototype-anti-brake-jack-arm-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/17092321/myriam-nicole-commenca-prototype-anti-brake-jack-arm-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-281101\">Commencal’s prototype floating brake arm from another angle.
