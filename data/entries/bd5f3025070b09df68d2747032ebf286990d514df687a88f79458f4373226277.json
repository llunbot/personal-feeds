According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, stores of this size typically have 70 to 80 employees, so around a quarter of the staff may have been exposed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple appears to be suffering from staff shortages at the Charleston store and other retail locations, both because of COVID exposures and the difficult labor market. Stores remain operational at this time, but some have been forced to close earlier and open later because of a lack of staff.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nContinuing issues with the delta variant of COVID-19 have impacted Apple's store plans. Apple stopped requiring customers and employees to wear masks back in June, but then <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/28/apple-retail-stores-mask-requirement/\">reinstated mask mandates</a> at many retail locations in the United States in late July. So far though, Apple has not reinstated widespread store shutdowns.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple had also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/16/in-person-today-at-apple-classes-resume/\">planned to bring back</a> in-person Today at Apple classes on August 30, but has since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/today-at-apple-in-person-classes-canceled/\">pushed back those plans</a> because of the prevalence of the delta variant.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/19/apple-closes-store-in-south-carolina/\">Apple Closes South Carolina Store After COVID-19 Exposure, Other Stores Cutting Hours Due to Staff Shortages</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-closes-south-carolina-store-after-covid-19-exposure-other-stores-cutting-hours-due-to-staff-shortages.2308074/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=sU4XYiRfO5s:BAk86IXW5rQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=sU4XYiRfO5s:BAk86IXW5rQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/sU4XYiRfO5s\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bd5f3025070b09df68d2747032ebf286990d514df687a88f79458f4373226277","category":"Apple"}
