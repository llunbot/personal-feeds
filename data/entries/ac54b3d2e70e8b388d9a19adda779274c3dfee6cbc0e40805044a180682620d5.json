And it manages to adopt much of the latest tech trending in the bike industry – like progressive geometry, wide XC tires, integrated routing &amp; UDH standards – but still retains full flexibility to let riders build it up how they really want. You can even pick from a rigid carbon fork or XC suspension fork depending on how you ride – or get both to adapt from race to race.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_rigid-carbon-fork-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_rigid-carbon-fork-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Mason Macro light aluminum adventure mountain bike hardtail, rigid carbon bikepacking fork build\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_rigid-carbon-fork-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_rigid-carbon-fork-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_rigid-carbon-fork-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_rigid-carbon-fork-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_rigid-carbon-fork-jpg.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_suspension-fork-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_suspension-fork-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Mason Macro light aluminum adventure mountain bike hardtail, XC suspension fork build\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_suspension-fork-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_suspension-fork-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_suspension-fork-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_suspension-fork-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_suspension-fork-jpg.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, like their other adventure-ready alloy bikes, it is handmade in Italy from custom Dedacciai tubing and gets tons of mounts to hang your gear on it, all while still managing to hit a quite affordable pricepoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developed for ultra racers looking for a lightweight but tough hardtail, the Macro is built to run either Mason’s burly HotShoe2 carbon fork for smoother bikepacking or a 100-120mm cross-country suspension for more gnarly off-road tours.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I’m really excited about the Macro. It totally embodies all aspects of our ‘Ride Driven Design’ ethos and progressive philosophy. From the full custom tubeset and HotShoe2 carbon fork through to details like UDH compatibility and innovative routing, the MASON Macro provides a cutting edge tool for those who want to adventure with purpose. This is all about configurability. I wanted the rider to have as much control as possible over the way they set this bike up. That’s why I’ve spent lots of time working on the cable routing, the accessory mounts and the readiness for suspension forks. The Macro can be easily switched around for different adventures.”</p>\n<cite><em>– Dom Mason, founder &amp; bike designer</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details &amp; unique adaptability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_handmade-welded-in-Italy-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_handmade-welded-in-Italy-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Mason Macro light aluminum adventure mountain bike hardtail, welded in Italy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_handmade-welded-in-Italy-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_handmade-welded-in-Italy-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_handmade-welded-in-Italy-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_handmade-welded-in-Italy-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_handmade-welded-in-Italy-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_handmade-welded-in-Italy-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2025-Mason-Macro-lightweight-alloy-adventure-MTB-bikepacking-mountain-bike-hardtail_handmade-welded-in-Italy-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>alloy frame welded in Italy from custom-drawn, heat-treated 7000-series Dedacciai aluminum tubing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cataforesi anti-corrosion-treated frame inside &amp;

And you can configure extra add-ons like Mason’s “load-bearing” <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bike-check-mason-insearchof-a-long-time-on-a-steel-bikepacking-bike-at-the-tour-divide/\" target=\"_blank\">Shutter</a> fender for the riding fork that incorporates a small but effective mini rack shelf, or their still tidy but stringer direct-mount <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/masons-search-for-a-better-way-to-carry-gear-is-over-the-isos-condenser-rack-is-here/\" target=\"_blank\">Condenser</a> fork rack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing starts a £3000 with a mechanical Shimano SLX groupset and the rigid carbon fork, or £3400 with a 100mm travel DT Swiss F232 ONE suspension fork. If you prefer a wireless electronic drivetrain, get a SRAM GX AXS build for £3800 with the carbon Hotshoe2 fork or £4200 with the DT F232 One suspension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://masoncycles.cc/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>MasonCycles.cc</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mason-macro-hardtail-builds-affordable-light-alloy-adventure-mountain-bike-in-italy/\">Mason Macro Hardtail Builds Affordable Light Alloy Adventure Mountain Bike In Italy</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ac54b3d2e70e8b388d9a19adda779274c3dfee6cbc0e40805044a180682620d5","category":"Cycling"}
