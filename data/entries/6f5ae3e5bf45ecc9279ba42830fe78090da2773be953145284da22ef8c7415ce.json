Although this is the newest version of the AirPods Pro, they're already seeing rock-bottom discounts and routinely beat the price on the 2019 non-MagSafe version.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/airpods-pro-holiday-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, Amazon has one of the all-around best Black Friday discounts, offering the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQMJHXY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">AirPods Pro with MagSafe</a> for <strong>$169.99</strong>, down from $249.00. We saw a better deal down to $159.00 earlier this week, but as of this morning that deal has expired.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQMJHXY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$80 OFF</div>AirPods Pro w/ MagSafe for $169.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a chance that the $159.00 sale price could return sometime today (or on Monday), but until then Amazon's sale is still a solid second-best offer. Keep an eye out on <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro%2F975690481\">Walmart</a> as well, which held the $159.00 sale throughout the week as well.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis version of the AirPods Pro comes with the MagSafe Charging Case, which is compatible with Apple's MagSafe Charger and other accessories that support MagSafe. Previously, the 2019 version included a Wireless Charging Case that supported Qi wireless charging but not MagSafe.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>AirPods 3 (2021)</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nIf you're looking to purchase the newest version of the AirPods, you'll want to head to Amazon for its discount on the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQL3NWT%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">AirPods 3</a>. There, you can get the new model for <strong>$149.99</strong>, down from $179.00.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/airpods-3-holiday.jpg\" /><div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQL3NWT%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$29 OFF</div>AirPods 3 for $149.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough this is a very slight discount, it remains the steepest markdown that we've tracked on the AirPods 3. For anyone looking to save more money, we recommend looking at any other model, particularly the new AirPods Pro.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>AirPods Max (2020)</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nAmazon has <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZD76NP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue\">AirPods Max</a> for <strong>$439.99</strong>, down from $549.00. This is the second-best price we've tracked to date on the AirPods Max.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/airpods-max-holiday.jpg\" /><div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZD76NP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$110 OFF</div>AirPods Max for $439.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe're keeping track of all this season's best deals in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/black-friday/\"><strong>Black Friday 2021 Roundup</strong></a>.
