{"title":"iOS 15 and Google AMP","link":"https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/amp.html","date":1633648160000,"content":"\n<p>Jeff Johnson:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For the past several days at least, Google search results have not\nincluded AMP links on iOS 15, but they still include AMP links on\niOS 14. I’ve determined that Safari’s User-Agent makes the\ndifference. (You can spoof the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent\">User-Agent</a> on iOS using the\nSafari web inspector on macOS.) […]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Update:</strong> I’ve received a statement from Danny\nSullivan, Google’s public search liaison: “It’s a bug specific to\niOS 15 that we’re working on. We expect it will be resolved soon.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a weird bug. It’s made weirder by the (I think) coincidence that there a bunch of popular new extensions for Safari that redirect AMP links to regular non-AMP web pages. I’ve used all three of these extensions, and they’re all great:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://underpassapp.com/StopTheMadness/\">StopTheMadness</a> — Johnson’s own $8 extension, that offers a whole bunch of functionality to block shitty website behavior.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://amplosion.app/\">Amplosion</a> — $3 extension from Apollo developer Christian Selig. Wins for best icon for sure.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://overamped.app/\">Overamped</a> — $2 extension from Joseph Duffy. Simple and focused.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From the DF archive, January 2017: “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/01/17/schreiber-amp\">The Problem With AMP</a>”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/07/ios-15-amp\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"83a44491178a5e7c1b47b943709659a273cb5d47488847388e428de9795e58cd","category":"Tech"}
