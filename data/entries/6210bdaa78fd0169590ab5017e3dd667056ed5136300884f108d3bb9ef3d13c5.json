On this basis, it can't be ruled out that Apple may choose to charge for more advanced features within its Apple Intelligence offering.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWood added that Apple Intelligence could give the company an option to launched a bundled subscription service with various services under a single price, akin to a new Apple One tier.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple in the June quarter saw a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/01/apple-q3-2024-earnings-takeaways/\">steep increase in services revenue</a> at $24.2 billion, up from $21.2 billion a year ago and a new all-time revenue record. Analysts believe that making its own AI features another services revenue stream could allow Apple to compensate for the slower pace of hardware upgrades and also enable the company to pass the high cost of its investment in AI onto customers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-servers/\">reportedly</a> started building its own AI servers that use the M2 Ultra chip, and it is said to be developing its own <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-developing-its-own-ai-server-processor/\">AI server processor</a> using TSMC's 3nm process for use as soon as 2025, which could enhance the performance of its data centers and future AI tools that rely on the cloud. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to spend several billion on hardware to support its artificial intelligence development in 2024, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-ai-server-spending-2024/\">according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. Kuo said he expects Apple to spend \"at least\" $620 million on servers in 2023 and $4.75 billion on servers in 2024. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cnbc-com/\">CNBC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/apple-intelligence-subscription-price/\">Would You Subscribe to Apple Intelligence?
