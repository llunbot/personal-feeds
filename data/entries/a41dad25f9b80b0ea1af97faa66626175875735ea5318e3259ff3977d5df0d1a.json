{"title":"Technogym MyRun Treadmill In-Depth Review","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/10/technogym-myrun-treadmill-review.html","date":1698686011000,"content":"<p><img title=\"DSC_8856-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8856-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8856 Enhanced NR\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>The Technogym MyRun treadmill has been around for over 5 years now, yet despite its age, it continues to be a popular option people are considering for usage with Zwift and other indoor running platforms. As such, the MyRun has been floating around the DCR Cave for about 18 months. Both myself and my wife have put a number of miles on it, giving us a pretty solid feel for how well it works – and some of the catches.</p>\n<p>The main unique feature of the MyRun treadmill is largely its solid connectivity to apps like Zwift via Bluetooth Smart, or platforms like TrainingPeaks (structured workouts) and Strava (re-creating your outdoor runs, inside, 3D worlds and all). In fact, back years ago when <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2018/02/zwift-officially-launches-running-what-you-need-to-get-started.html\">Zwift first launched Zwift Running</a>, they did so at a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os9g7eF-IS8\">launch event in New York City</a> packed with Technogym MyRun treadmills.</p>\n<p>The secondary aspect that’s most notable is just how minimalist the treadmill is. Of course, as you’ll see that has both benefits and drawbacks. While it’ll fit into the sleekest of garages, it means you sacrifice quick-access type buttons found on many treadmills for instantly changing pace to specific values. Point is, there’s always tradeoffs to be had – and hopefully, in this review you can figure out whether or not those tradeoffs make sense to you.</p>\n<p>Finally, note that Technogym provided a media loaner Technogym MyRun to test. In fact, it already shipped back to them last week.  If you found this review useful, you can use the links at the bottom, or consider <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/support\">becoming a DCR Supporter</a> which makes the site ad-free, while also getting access to a mostly weekly video series behind the scenes of the DCR Cave. And of course, it makes you awesome.</p>\n<h3><strong><span>In The Box/Delivery:</span></strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1231.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_1231.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 1231\" width=\"649\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Like most home gym equipment, how precisely things get delivered depends on your exact region. In my case, it meant that two dudes and a truck offloaded the treadmill and in a matter of minutes assembled it. It turns out they get special training on how to assemble all manner of devices, from Technogym treadmills like this (as well as the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2022/08/technogym-ride-smart-indoor-bike-in-depth-review.html\">Technogym Ride smart bike</a> they assembled that same day) to e-bike battery installation systems. You can see the treadmill set of boxes on the right of the truck:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1235.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_1235.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 1235\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" /></p>\n<p>Essentially a certified handyman that also drives a big truck, and not specific to Technogym. You can see the boxes here on the pallet. Essentially it’s just attaching the main console section:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1244.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_1244.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 1244\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>The other guy was upstairs working on the bike and I was watching up, and turned around a few mins later and the guy downstairs was done.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1249.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_1249.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 1249\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" /></p>\n<p>In any event, like I said, the whole thing basically consisted of them attaching the upper console portion. It was well under 15 minutes and very efficient. Sadly, I don’t have too much in the way of photos of that. Also, it’s kinda awkward taking pictures of people doing their jobs.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>The Hardware:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8840.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8840.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8840\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>So, let’s start with a quick look at the hardware side of things first, before I dive into the usage aspects of it. From an overall treadmill size perspective, the actual belt isn’t that much different than other treadmills. Instead, what differs is the lack of overbearing console up top (which often have a larger display). This lacks all of that, and thus feels smaller as it’s vertically not a beast. The tablet you see up top there isn’t part of the unit, but rather just an iPad.</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8862.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8862.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8862\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>The unit measures 69” long x 31” wide x 50” high (176cm long x 75.5cm wide x 126cm high), and weighs 202.8 pounds (92kg). This is a heck of a lot lighter than my <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/12/peloton-tread-in-depth-review.html\">Peloton Tread</a>, which weighs 290lbs/132kg. And also smaller in every dimension.</p>\n<p>The maximum permitted runner weight on the Technogym MyRun is listed as 308.6lbs/140kg. Technogym doesn’t appear to specify an ideal runner height (or, ideal for the treadmill anyway). In my case, I’m 6’2” (188cm) tall, and as I’ll outline in more detail later, I had no problems with it (sometimes for taller people, you want a longer belt – the runnable surface of this belt measures 143cm/56.3” long, and 50cm/19.7” wide.</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8884.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8884.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8884\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><em>(The small pod you see in the upper left corner is the NPE RUNN, this is not part of the Technogym MyRun treadmill, but rather an accessory I use to validate accuracy of said treadmill.)</em></p>\n<p>There is no folding or otherwise for the treadmill to save space. Some treadmills can also bend up against a wall or such, this doesn’t do that either It has wheels on the front, to move it around, which I did from time to time.</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8880.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8880.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8880\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" /></p>\n<p>From a speed/specs standpoint, the treadmill goes up to a max speed of 12.5MPH/20.0KPH (4:48/mile or 3:00/KM). Again, as I’ll cover later on in more detail, if you’re not familiar with running that much – then that’s more than enough. If you’re a rather fast runner that’s specifically training for shorter distances (e.g. 400m races), then it might not be enough for what you need. But I think that’s a very very very rare slice of the population.</p>\n<p>From an incline standpoint, it tops out at 12%. There is no negative decline. Here’s a quick shot of it at 0% incline, and it at 12% incline. You can see the front legs/wheels extending downwards to hold it up:</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8869-2.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8869-2.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8869 2\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" /> <img title=\"DSC_8867.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8867.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8867\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" /></p>\n<p>The unit’s console displays speed/distance/time/incline, and has Bluetooth connectivity (via Bluetooth FTMS). It does not have WiFI, nor ANT+ connectivity. Nor does it have any sort of speakers. It does however, have two water bottle holders. Further, the side handles are capable of holding many watches.</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8929.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8929.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8929\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>And it seems reasonably sweat resistant. Both myself and my wife have sweated all over it, and even put it into a heat acclimation chamber for a month (airing it out after each run), and seems totally fine.</p>\n<p><img title=\"GPTempDownload 15.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/GPTempDownload-15.jpg\" alt=\"GPTempDownload 15\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" /></p>\n<p>Finally, the hardware has a small safety strap/magnet on the bottom that you can pretend to wear, which will stop the treadmill if you fly off the back.</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8879.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8879.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8879\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Obviously, you and I both know you’re not going to wear that. But, there is value in removing it if you have smaller humans around the house, to ensure they can’t start the treadmill without it.</p>\n<p>With that, let’s talk about things we’ve actually used.</p>\n<h3><strong><span>Regular Usage:</span></strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8910.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8910.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8910\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>It’s always interesting to me to see how two different athletes train. In the case of myself and my wife, we’ve used the treadmill in rather different ways. Sure, we both run on it roughly the same way (her, gracefully…me, not so much) – but we use different apps/features. In her case, for probably 98.5% of her runs, she’s just used it in standalone mode, with no app control/integration. Not even pairing it to her watch for more accurate pace/distance data. She just prefers to hammer out her workouts using the controls on the console</p>\n<p>Inversely, in my case, I’ve almost always run on it with Zwift. There’s been a handful of cases otherwise where I’ve used the Technogym Live app (more on that later), but in almost all my runs I’ve linked it up to Zwift to get speed/distance within Zwift and control my virtual avatar there.</p>\n<p>Starting off with the more basic usage first though, is simply getting on the treadmill and starting it. You’ll tap really any of the levers/buttons to wake it up, if it’s fallen asleep. And then from there you’ll tap the lower-middle lever to start the actual treadmill belt:</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8870-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8870-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8870 Enhanced NR\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>At this point you’ve got two core controls here:</p>\n<p>A) Left side paddle for increasing/decreasing incline<br />\nB) Right side paddle for increasing/decreasing speed</p>\n<p>Here’s the left side:</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8863-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8863-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8863 Enhanced NR\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>And then here’s the right side:</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8865-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8865-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8865 Enhanced NR\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>In addition, that middle paddle/lever for instantly stopping the treadmill (or, resuming it again). And…that’s it. There are no other controls on the treadmill. Instead, just data screens you can look at. These are:</p>\n<p>A) Far left screen: Timer<br />\nB) Middle left screen: Current incline<br />\nC) Middle right screen: Speed<br />\nD) Far right screen: Distance</p>\n<p>When it comes to this data, none of it is customizable. Also, it won’t directly sync 3rd party apps. For example, if you start a simple run as a warm-up in Zwift, perhaps do 10 minutes, and then start a new route/course in Zwift, you’ll have a Zwift distance/timer that doesn’t match your treadmill distance/timer. This hasn’t really been a big issue for me, but figured I’d mention it.</p>\n<p>So when I look at treadmills there’s a few core things I’m looking at. Certainly, top-end speed is one of those things. At 12.5MPH/20KPH, this is pretty much the norm for most mid-range treadmills. For perspective, this equates to a pace of 4:48/mi pace, or a 3:00/km pace. Mildly cruising.</p>\n<p>Some higher-end ones can go higher, but practically speaking unless you’re a short-distance runner (e.g. training for 800m races), then you won’t likely need to be doing a ton of very short and fast bits. Whereas for most of my training with intervals, about the fastest I’m doing anything sustained is down to the 3:00/km (4:48/mi) pace. Granted, the shortest distance of race I train for tends to be half-marathon – but I suspect this is fast enough for most people. Note that I’ll cover speed responsiveness in the accuracy section.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0297.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0297.png\" alt=\"IMG 0297\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>Then finally, there’s aspects around the belt. How does the belt feel (including length), and what’s the sound/noise levels like.</p>\n<p>From a belt feel standpoint, I didn’t find it too firm or too squishy. Perhaps some people are more particular than I, but I was totally fine with the belt bounce/feel. Whereas I actually don’t particularly like running on fancier/higher-end slat-based treadmills, as it just doesn’t feel right to me (this is a belt-based treadmill, so that’s all good in my book). Further, this belt length is often seen as perhaps a touch bit short at 143cm/56.3” long. Certainly, that’s because Technogym is likely trying to keep it smaller for smaller spaces. Again, even as a relatively tall guy at 6’ 2” (188cm) – I simply didn’t have any issues here.</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8926.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8926.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8926\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Likewise, my wife, shorter at 5’2” (157cm) certainly didn’t have any issues with the treadmill belt either. Sorry, this photo was taken through the plastic film of the heat acclimation chamber I made. Thus, it kinda has an Instagram filter vibe to it.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0291.png\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0291.png\" alt=\"IMG 0291\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Sure, every once in a while towards the end of a tough set of intervals I’d find myself drifting dangerously close to the back of the treadmill, but such is life on almost any treadmill. Get tired enough, and you’ll probably flirt with disaster at some point.</p>\n<p>While the Technogym treadmill does have an area in front of the belt that is not belt (where the motors and such are presumably sitting), I didn’t have any issues clipping it while running. Sometimes I’ll clip that on treadmills that’ll have a beefier front-end, but the Technogym is pretty thin in that area (depth wise, and even tapers closer to the belt), so it wasn’t a problem for me.</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8860.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8860.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8860\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Finally, on the noise side of life, that’s a bit trickier. The treadmill sits in the lower portion of the DCR Cave, which is basically just a giant concrete warehouse. It’s the worst possible scenario for noise, thus, I don’t really have a good way to measure that down here unfortunately. It’s certainly not quiet, that’s for sure. But it’s also not the loudest possible treadmill I’ve heard either. It’s just…well…normal sounding?</p>\n<p>Look, I can tell you about lots of things, but in terms of noise on this one, that’s the one area I lack: A proper living room with family members trying to watch a TV show while I run intervals. I suspect someone in the comments has instead unlocked that achievement, and can offer some perspective.</p>\n<h3><strong><span>App Integration:</span></strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0293.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0293.png\" alt=\"IMG 0293\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>When it comes to connectivity and apps, the are basically two rough categories here:</p>\n<p>A) The flotilla of Technogym apps<br />\nB) 3rd party apps (via open standards)</p>\n<p>For the Technogym apps, there are indeed, many apps. I honestly can’t keep track all of them, but they do have specific purposes. For example, the Technogym app (literally titled ‘Technogym’) on my phone will show my completed workouts and other workouts I can do with a a heart rate sensor. But, it will not connect to the treadmill. For that, I need the Technogym Live app, which does not run on the phone, but only on my iPad and computer. Except, it crashes every time I tap the ‘Settings’ button for the treadmill in the app on my computer. Thus, I’m ultimately left with only the Technogym Live app on my iPad as functional.</p>\n<p>This app lets you do structured workouts, both ones created by Technogym as well as those that you’ve created. Further, if you’ve got TrainingPeaks linked as an account, it’ll even iterate through those workouts (including changing pace/distance).</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0245.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0245.png\" alt=\"IMG 0245\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>Likewise, for Strava, it’ll even pull in my outdoor runs and automatically control the treadmill (yes, pace AND incline) to match exactly what I did outside, showing me a little Google Earth map of it as I go along. It’s to quite street-view level (as in, ground-level), but it is on an angle and gives me the general feel of the area I’m running in (albeit, within the limitations of Google’s data set, thus here it shows more of a leaf-less winter feel, than the green or fall leaves I was running). Still, it’s cool.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0272.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0272.png\" alt=\"IMG 0272\" width=\"355\" height=\"266\" /> <img title=\"IMG_0278 3.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0278-3.png\" alt=\"IMG 0278 3\" width=\"355\" height=\"266\" /></p>\n<p>But they’ve also got a number of their own workout components as well. These include structured workouts, coached workouts, scenic runs in a variety of spots, and non-running workouts.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0247.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0247.png\" alt=\"IMG 0247\" width=\"235\" height=\"176\" /> <img title=\"IMG_0248.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0248.png\" alt=\"IMG 0248\" width=\"235\" height=\"176\" /> <img title=\"IMG_0249.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0249.png\" alt=\"IMG 0249\" width=\"235\" height=\"176\" /></p>\n<p>For example on the scenic runs, there’s plenty of different locales and terrain types to choose from – all there to remind you that you’re stuck inside on a treadmill.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0252.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0252.png\" alt=\"IMG 0252\" width=\"235\" height=\"176\" /> <img title=\"IMG_0254.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0254.png\" alt=\"IMG 0254\" width=\"235\" height=\"176\" /> <img title=\"IMG_0255.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0255.png\" alt=\"IMG 0255\" width=\"235\" height=\"176\" /></p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0253.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0253.png\" alt=\"IMG 0253\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>Within that app you can also create your own structured workouts in the Technogym app (as opposed to via TrainingPeaks):</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0256.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0256.png\" alt=\"IMG 0256\" width=\"355\" height=\"266\" /> <img title=\"IMG_0257.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0257.png\" alt=\"IMG 0257\" width=\"355\" height=\"266\" /></p>\n<p>However, that process for truly custom workouts is a nightmare for interval workouts. That’s because each (AND EVERY @#$*U#) segment has to be created individually (with no repeat type option), and more annoyingly, the sliders to set each pace/distance/time/etc are incredibly sensitive, so getting the exact distances you weight (e.g. 800m) or exact paces you want (e.g. 4:00/km) is mind-bogglingly difficult with your finger given the vast expanse of possibilities.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0265.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0265.png\" alt=\"IMG 0265\" width=\"235\" height=\"176\" /> <img title=\"IMG_0263.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0263.png\" alt=\"IMG 0263\" width=\"235\" height=\"176\" /> <img title=\"IMG_0264.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0264.png\" alt=\"IMG 0264\" width=\"235\" height=\"176\" /></p>\n<p>Seriously, if someone is Technogym is listening (and, I know you are), whoever made this UI needs to be sat down in a room, given 15 structured interval workouts, and made to try and input them into the app. I guarantee you when you check on the state of that person after 15-20 minutes, they’ll be gone. Either they’ll have quit the company entirely, or, they’ll be back at their desk fixing it. I refuse to believe anyone has ever actually tried creating a custom workout this way.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the app is a place to check settings an update firmware on the Technogym MyRun. Again, you can’t do that from the phone app – which seems kinda silly to me.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0243.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0243.png\" alt=\"IMG 0243\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>In any event, when it comes to control of the treadmill, as I mentioned, you can use the built-in Technogym Live functionality, including changing pace and incline with TrainingPeaks workouts. However, that functionality isn’t available with Zwift. Technogym says that’s been offered to Zwift, but they haven’t taken advantage of that opportunity. Like most treadmill companies, there are a lot of secutity/safety controls when it comes to allowing 3rd party apps to control a treadmill (primarily speed), as you can imagine a case where an app incorrectly and instantly sets the treadmill to max speed, resulting in someone flying off the back.</p>\n<p>In Technogym’s case, they have a specific certification process for apps that request control, but alas, Zwift hasn’t taken advantage of that. So instead, let’s talk about what Zwift can do.</p>\n<p>The Technogym MyRun transmits across just Bluetooth Smart, and specifically Bluetooth Smart FTMS. This makes it very compatible with apps like Zwift, and most Garmin watches. But not quite as compatible as Technogym should have made it. Specifically, it lacks the Bluetooth Smart footpad profile, which would have made it easier for other apps and even watches to connect to. For example, neither the Polar or Suunto watch I’ve been testing lately can connect to it, because they don’t support Bluetooth Smart FTMS (but do support Bluetooth footpads). But, Zwift can via FTMS, because it’s the same protocol smart trainers use:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0281 2.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0281-2.png\" alt=\"IMG 0281 2\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>Inside of Zwift you’ll connect to both the running speed and cadence portions, and even heart rate if you’ve configured that to pass it through. In my case, I largely just used another strap:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0282 2.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0282-2.png\" alt=\"IMG 0282 2\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>At that point, that’s all you need to do. Next, you start whichever course/route/etc on Zwift you want to, and then off you go. It’ll transmit your pace to Zwift, which in turn Zwift calculates to distance. It’ll also send cadence as well.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0290.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0290.png\" alt=\"IMG 0290\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>It’s super important to note that Zwift will not change the incline on the treadmill, nor will Zwift change the pace if doing a structured workout. Both are things you’ll need to change yourself manually. In talking to Technogym, they say this is something that they’re very open to integrating with Zwift, but at the moment that ball is in Zwift’s court.</p>\n<p>This integration would require validation by Technogym, merely due to the risks associated with 3rd parties controlling pace on a treadmill (most companies are very hesitant of allowing any 3rd party apps to control pace or incline, but Technogym says they have a certification process in place to do so, but Zwift hasn’t leveraged it yet). Thus for example in this structured workout, I needed to manually change each of the steps as I ran along (whereas, if done within the Technogym app as a TrainingPeaks workout, it would have done it for me).</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0288.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0288.png\" alt=\"IMG 0288\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>From a connectivity standpoint, I had no problems following a firmware update last winter. Prior to that I did see dropouts from time to time, but I haven’t seen those since. It’s also worthwhile pointing out that unfortunately the Technogym MyRun only supports a single concurrent Bluetooth connection. Thus, if you wanted to transmit to Zwift, but also record that on your watch (of any brand), you can’t do that. This is likely the usage of an older Bluetooth chipset which doesn’t support multiple concurrent Bluetooth Connections. Likewise, because they don’t support ANT+ on the MyRun, you can’t leverage that either to work around this limitation.</p>\n<p>The reason you’d want to get treadmill distance/pace into your watch is that most watches will calculate Training Load and related stats. While those stats are generally based on heart rate (or cycling power), that doesn’t mean you want inaccurate/missing data for the running portions. So that is a bit of a gap that I had to essentially solve for using other sensors (or, just accepting less-accurate wrist-based pace/distance data).</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0295.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0295.png\" alt=\"IMG 0295\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>Also note that when in Zwift mode, there isn’t any recording or the data to the Technogym app (in fact, you have to have it completely closed out). Again, not a huge limitation for most, but something worthwhile noting.</p>\n<p>In any event, the Zwift integration worked well, even if it lacked changing the incline. And again, once I had the firmware update from last winter, it worked without issue connectivity-wise.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Accuracy and Responsiveness:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8891-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8891-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8891 Enhanced NR\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>When it comes to accuracy on a treadmill, I’m using three devices/tools to validate it. The trick though, is that not all of these tools are created equal. Instead, I’m basically trying to proxy for accuracy by committee. That can have its disadvantages when a single device is correct, and the rest are wrong. But in this case, I use these same devices on other treadmills as well as outside – so I’ve got a pretty good established baseline.</p>\n<p>In any event, here’s the comparative data sets/devices:</p>\n<p>– <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/tag/stryd\">Stryd V3 footpod</a><br />\n– <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2020/01/npe-runn-treadmill-smart-sensor-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">NPE RUNN Treadmill Sensor</a><br />\n– <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2022/07/garmin-hrm-pro-plus-heart-rate-strap-in-depth-review.html\">Garmin HRM-PRO Plus</a> (indoor running mode)</p>\n<p>This is also in addition to wrist-based watches that have estimates of pace. I’m not including that data in this review, though I did collect it. Merely because it’s often kinda variable. That said, it can provide a good tie-breaker in some cases, and can often be better than some well-worn gym treadmills that haven’t had belt maintenance in decades.</p>\n<p>In the case of the Stryd/NPE/HRM-PRO Plus sensors, they were connected to watches that were physically strapped to the treadmill, thus ensuring they were not using wrist-based detection at all. It was purely from those sensors. In addition, I also had some watches on my wrist – the Suunto Race and Polar Vantage V3. I’m not really going to focus on that data in this review, and instead save that for their respective in-depth reviews. Merely to not muddy the waters too much with too many chart lines.</p>\n<p>For the data here, I’m going to focus on two main data sets – one from last winter, and one from just yesterday. All on current hardware/firmware as of their respective times. I’m picking ones 8 months apart partially because I could easily find/compile those sets, and partially to show if there’s any drift/etc over time that might need looking at.</p>\n<p>First up, let’s start with the set from yesterday – as it’s really easy and clear to see things on. This was a standard ladder/pyramid workout. An initial warm-up, and then a set that started fast, got slightly easier in pace (but also longer), before getting faster again. Here’s roughly what it should look like:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0288.PNG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/IMG_0288-1.png\" alt=\"IMG 0288\" width=\"720\" height=\"397\" /></p>\n<p>I then added an extra two intervals to the end of the planned workout, to demonstrate some speed responsiveness bits. So, here’s the speed as recorded by all the devices noted above. Here’s the entire workout, but for this section, I’ve highlighted a point during the warm-up, and you can see that the speeds are very close there (around the 5-6 minute marker). <a href=\"https://analyze.dcrainmaker.com/#/public/08a32392-d953-44f1-65b4-b55045253c4c\">Here’s the data set</a>:</p>\n<p><img title=\"Accuracy-Oct23rd-GeneralSpeed.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/Accuracy-Oct23rd-GeneralSpeed.jpg\" alt=\"Accuracy Oct23rd GeneralSpeed\" width=\"720\" height=\"276\" /></p>\n<p>It’s important to understand that the Technogym MyRun does not show actual speed, rather, it only shows/reports the set-point speed (the speed you told it to go). This means that when I adjust speeds, the Technogym appears to ‘instantly’ switch from 10KPH to 16KPH, but in reality that takes time to ramp (else, you’d have flown off the back of the treadmill from the jolt). You can see that ramp in the graphs below.</p>\n<p>In any case, to break-out those speeds in the chart during the warm-up, at that moment in time they show:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>NPE RUNN:</strong> 11.25KPH<br />\n<strong>Technogym MyRun:</strong> 11.40KPH (5:16/km, or 8:28/mi)<br />\n<strong>Garmin HRM-PRO Plus:</strong> 11.46KPH<br />\n<strong>Stryd V3:</strong> 10.85KPG</p></blockquote>\n<p>Again, there’s no guarantee any of these is right. But, I do find in general that the NPE RUNN tends to be very accurate – thus, it’s the proxy I’m most looking at alignment for.</p>\n<p>So let’s zoom in a bit. This is fascinating, because the NPE RUNN treadmill sensor does a really good job of demonstrating the pulsing that treadmills do, as it deals with weight and my position on the treadmill. As a runner you won’t even notice this, but there are slight speed variations seen here, which are shown by that up and down of the speed by that green line. We see on this interval that the Garmin HRM-PRO Plus is now measuring higher, while the Stryd V3 continues to measure quite a bit lower.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Accuracy-Oct23rd-ZoomedIn.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/Accuracy-Oct23rd-ZoomedIn.jpg\" alt=\"Accuracy Oct23rd ZoomedIn\" width=\"718\" height=\"275\" /></p>\n<p>Now, as expected, the lower the speed, the more ‘together’ all these units are. Yet, the higher the speed, the more they spread apart. Check out these three higher-speed sections here:</p>\n<p><img title=\"Accuracy-Sprints.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/Accuracy-Sprints.jpg\" alt=\"Accuracy Sprints\" width=\"720\" height=\"276\" /></p>\n<p>In this case, here’s those top-end reported speeds after it stabilized for a bit – before it dropped down. You’ll note that the Garmin HRM-PRO Plus did seem to bump a bit higher for some reason briefly</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>NPE RUNN:</strong> 19.72KPH<br />\n<strong>Technogym MyRun:</strong> 19.99KPH (funny, it didn’t report exactly 20.00KPH)<br />\n<strong>Garmin HRM-PRO Plus:</strong> 20.89KPH<br />\n<strong>Stryd V3:</strong> 19.35KPH</p></blockquote>\n<p>For me, I’m OK with that accuracy of those top speeds. I’m also happy to see that it’s not fluctuating a ton in terms of actual speeds. My older ProForm 1250 treadmill’s motor simply isn’t powerful enough and it often fluctuates at high speeds by a considerable amount, up to a couple KPH. That’s a ton!</p>\n<p>For context, here’s the specific structure I did above, per set treadmill speed:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>#1: At 16.5KPH</strong> (3:36/km or 5:48/mi), ramped from 10KPH (casual running)<br />\n<strong>#2: A 20KPH</strong> (3:00/km or 4:50/mi), ramped from 5KPH (walking)<br />\n<strong>#3: At 20KPH</strong> (3:00km or 4:50/mi), ramped from 10KPH (casual running)</p></blockquote>\n<p>In other words, my goal here was to figure out the exact ramp times for each one. But also, to see how much different it was a higher speeds. So, from a ramp standpoint, here we go:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>A) From 10KPH to 16.5KPH:</strong> ~10 seconds (recovery running to medium tempo)<br />\n<strong>B) From 10KPH to 20KPH:</strong> ~18 seconds (recovery running to hard sprint)<br />\n<strong>C) From 5KPH to 20KPH:</strong> ~23 seconds (recovery walking to hard sprint)</p></blockquote>\n<p>For the above durations, I used the NPE RUNN treadmill sensor as a way of knowing when exactly the treadmill belt actually reached the set-point speed. Inversely, I didn’t see any difference in ramping back down (slowing down) timeframes. They appeared virtually identical.</p>\n<p>So, let’s look at that other workout from last winter. This is a longer workout, about 80 minutes long, that was heavily steady-state, with some sprints tossed in because…I have no idea why. Because someone thought it’d be fun I guess (spoiler: not fun). Here’s <a href=\"https://analyze.dcrainmaker.com/#/public/87577a88-cace-4e47-6054-7827a64f17bc\">that data set</a>:</p>\n<p><img title=\"AccuracyWinter-Wide.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/AccuracyWinter-Wide.jpg\" alt=\"AccuracyWinter Wide\" width=\"719\" height=\"290\" /></p>\n<p>So, looking at a few pieces, here’s the last steady-state section, to see how the paces compare. Keep in mind here that the vertical scale on the graph is *MUCH* smaller right here. So you’re looking at a variance of +/- 0.1KPH from the NPE RUNN/Stryd units. The Garmin HRM-PRO Plus has a higher variance here of +/- 0.3ish. The Technogym Treadmill continues to report only the set-point, not actual speed.</p>\n<p><img title=\"AccuracyWinter-MidPoint.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/AccuracyWinter-MidPoint.jpg\" alt=\"AccuracyWinter MidPoint\" width=\"719\" height=\"290\" /></p>\n<p>I thought it was interesting/notable that the Stryd and NPE RUNN were much closer here last winter, than now (across this entire workout). Make of that what you will. Does that mean the treadmill is slowly drifting? Or does that mean Stryd is slowly drifting? Or does that mean some combination of them? My guess here is that above, the difference between the treadmill and the NPE RUNN is only 0.1KPH, versus Stryd is considerably further apart now. Thus, my guess is Stryd is slowly drifting. But that’s probably a topic for another day.</p>\n<p>Instead, here’s a sprint. We see here the same/similar ramp rates as previous, because these intervals happen to be in the same ballpark.</p>\n<p><img title=\"AccuracyWinter-MidInterval.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/AccuracyWinter-MidInterval.jpg\" alt=\"AccuracyWinter MidInterval\" width=\"719\" height=\"290\" /></p>\n<p>And looking at those values at the mid-point of the interval we see:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>NPE RUNN:</strong> 15.64KPH<br />\n<strong>Technogym MyRun:</strong> 16.00KPH<br />\n<strong>Garmin HRM-PRO Plus:</strong> 16.18KPH<br />\n<strong>Stryd V3: </strong>15.56KPH</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ultimately, I’d say that both in terms of what I see in these two sets as well as 18 months of sets, I have no problems with accuracy on the Technogym MyRun. It seems within reason of what I’d expect and lines itself up pretty nicely compared to the NPE RUNN treadmill sensor, which I find to be one of the most accurate proxies for treadmills as it’s literally measuring the belt itself. It splits the difference between the Stryd V3 (lower) and the Garmin HRM-PRO Plus (higher), which are both using accelerometers and gyros to estimate pace and speed.</p>\n<p>While Stryd has often talked about how treadmills aren’t as accurate as their footpads, due to speed changes within each footstep (because the belt gets weighted down), that doesn’t change the reality that the NPE RUNN correctly capture the total average time between each of the numerous markers on the treadmill – thus distance is then calculated correctly as well (irrespective of tiny fluctuations between it).</p>\n<p><em>(Note: All of the charts in these accuracy sections were created using the DCR Analyzer tool. It allows you to compare power meters/trainers, heart rate, cadence, speed/pace, GPS tracks, and plenty more. You can use it as well for your own gadget comparisons, <a href=\"http://www.dcrainmaker.com/analyzer\">more details here</a>.)</em></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Wrap-Up:</span></strong></h3>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_8903-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/10/DSC_8903-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" alt=\"DSC 8903 Enhanced NR\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Over the last 18 months or so, I’ve been asked many times what I thought of it, and how it compares. And my answer has always been the same: It’s a great little unit that seems to edge on overpriced – at least for the US market (the Euro market is more complicated, as I’ll explain). Specifically, at $4,050USD/€3,500, it’s on the higher end of the spectrum for mainstream consumer treadmill prices. Sure, there are always higher-end ones that offer something extra, but that’s not this unit. Likewise, there are always cheaper ones that have a struggling motor, reduced specs, or less durable components. Also, that’s not this unit.</p>\n<p>A common comparison a lot of people have asked about is the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/12/peloton-tread-in-depth-review.html\">Peloton Tread I bought a couple years ago</a>, which is priced at $2,995USD/€3,795. That’s a very different treadmill in terms of fancier features. Namely, it’s got a big brilliant screen, more controls, and has an optional subscription component. But to be clear, that subscription is indeed…optional (just like the Technogym App subscription is an optional subscription, at 8.99EUR/month or 89EUR/year). If you just want the same core treadmill portion that the Technogym MyRun has, then those baseline speed/incline/specs features are nearly identical between the two treadmills. Thus one can see why so many people keep asking for my comparison between the two units. Especially given the Euro pricing is nearly identical (of course, at present, Technogym has far greater country deliverability).</p>\n<p>However, the biggest technical advantage the Technogym MyRun has is direct integration to Zwift (which Peloton lacks entirely), in terms of transmitting your speed via Bluetooth Smart. That’s very useful and has a very high “just works” factor. But notably, you can also add that to a Peloton Treadmill using the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2020/01/npe-runn-treadmill-smart-sensor-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">NPE RUNN</a> for about $100 (a relatively trivial sum after spending $3,000+ on a treadmill). And in that case, it’ll even give you the correct exact paces during speed ramp changes too. Now, if Zwift and Technogym had done proper integration of controlled pace and/or incline into the Technogym MyRun (which Technogym says they are very open to), then that’d be a huge selling point.</p>\n<p>The other area the Technogym lacks is customizable hardware presets for speed when used with apps like Zwift. For example having a preset configured to a certain interval speed, versus having to hold the paddle up/down the entire time. Sure, if you use the Technogym app to create a workout then it controls it automatically (which is awesome), but creating an interval workout on their app will likely take years off your life due to how frustratingly bad it is. While I’m not a huge fan of Peloton’s screen-based speed presets (due to the messiness of tapping a tiny area of the touchscreen while sweaty running mid-interval), at least they exist. It’s the one area I actually prefer my older ProForm treadmill with its silly TI-82 calculator-style console of a dozen preset buttons. A case of function over form.</p>\n<p>I bring all these comparisons up because that’s real life. If you’re looking at buying a treadmill, you’re comparing products. When I mentioned the Technogym MyRun was going back to Technogym (it was just a media loaner), my wife audibly said “Aww, I liked that one”. And it’s true. Both of us liked it. There’s a simplicity in Technogym’s design that makes it really appealing, both from a visual hardware standpoint, but also a functional standpoint. Simply stand on it, tap and go. Zwift then does it’s connectivity magic, and life is great.</p>\n<p>Point is, Technogym has made a great little treadmill. Sure, it could use some very minor tweaks, but on the whole it’s a great unit that’s worked well for us over the last 18 months. The data appears accurate to me, and the stability of the hardware and connectivity has been solid. How that fits into other competitive options for your specific needs is a trickier question for me to answer, but hopefully this review gave you the details you need to sort that out.</p>\n<p>With that, thanks for reading!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"a41dad25f9b80b0ea1af97faa66626175875735ea5318e3259ff3977d5df0d1a","category":"Cycling"}
