The transistors are embedded in the spacecraft's circuitry and are responsible for approximately 200 unique applications, many of which are critical to keeping the mission operating as it orbits Jupiter and repeatedly zooms by Europa, interrogating the frozen moon with nine science instruments.</p>\n<p>The transistors on the Europa Clipper spacecraft are already installed, and removing them for inspections or replacement would delay the mission's launch until late next year. Europa Clipper has a 21-day launch window beginning October 10 to begin its journey into the outer solar system.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048668#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048668&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ac74a7467fcac4799fa0c32387b3569e02529a93d457a393a59a368dc49b3872","category":"Tech"}
