Not anymore. Mozilla has announced that a new <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/icloud-passwords/\">iCloud Passwords extension for Firefox</a> for macOS is now available. The extension will allow Firefox to access iCloud Keychain and fill in usernames and passwords when needed for accessing accounts online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iCloud Passwords extension for Firefox can also create passwords that are saved to the iCloud Keychain and synced to the Passwords app. The extension requires macOS Sonoma or later. An <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/icloud-bookmarks/\">iCloud Bookmarks extension for Firefox for Windows</a> is also available and requires <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pktq5699m62?rtc=1&amp;hl=en-us&amp;gl=US\">iCloud for Windows</a>.
