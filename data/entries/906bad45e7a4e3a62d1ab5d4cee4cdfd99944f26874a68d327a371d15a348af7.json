The account typically shares build numbers for upcoming iOS updates less than a week before they are released.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iOS-17.1.1-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nLast week, we were first to report that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/ios-17-1-1-is-coming/\">internally testing iOS 17.1.1</a>, based on evidence of the software version in our website's analytics logs. The update will almost certainly be focused on bug fixes and security patches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear exactly which bugs will be addressed in iOS 17.1.1. The update might include the same <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/ios-17-2-beta-addresses-wifi-issues/\">fix for Wi-Fi connectivity issues</a> that Apple rolled out in the iOS 17.2 beta, and it could resolve an issue where <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/ios-17-1-shutdown-bug-no-fix/\">some iPhones temporarily shut off overnight</a> for users still experiencing that. Apple also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-to-fix-iphone-15-bmw-charging-issue/\">promised to fix a BMW wireless charging issue</a> affecting the iPhone 15 lineup in an unspecified update coming later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.2 remains in beta testing, and it is expected to be released in December. That update includes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-beta-1-features/\">many new features and changes</a>, including Apple's promised Journal app, the ability for Apple Music subscribers to collaborate on playlists, a Translate option for the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro models, an iMessage Contact Key Verification security option, additional Weather and Clock widgets, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe also reported that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/04/watchos-update-to-fix-battery-drain-issue/\">preparing to release a watchOS update soon</a> with a fix for excessive Apple Watch battery drain. It's likely that update will be watchOS 10.1.1, but it could be watchOS 10.2 if Apple needs more time.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/ios-17-1-1-likely-to-be-released-this-week/\">Apple Likely to Release iOS 17.1.1 This Week With iPhone Bug Fixes</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-to-release-ios-17-1-1-this-week-with-iphone-bug-fixes.2410080/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"906bad45e7a4e3a62d1ab5d4cee4cdfd99944f26874a68d327a371d15a348af7","category":"Apple"}
