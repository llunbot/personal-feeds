Instead, graphics processing is handled entirely by the M2 chip, which includes up to a 76-core GPU that can access up to 192GB of unified memory.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Mac-Pro-Feature-Teal.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple's hardware engineering chief John Ternus briefly touched on the matter in an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/10/the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2023/\">interview with <em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber</a> last week, explaining that expandable GPU support for Apple silicon is not something that the company has pursued.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Fundamentally, we've built our architecture around this shared memory model and that optimization, and so it's not entirely clear to me how you'd bring in another GPU and do so in a way that is optimized for our systems,\" Ternus told Gruber. \"It hasn't been a direction that we wanted to pursue.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother limitation of the new Mac Pro compared to the Intel-based model is the lack of user-upgradeable RAM, given the unified memory is soldered to the M2 Ultra chip. In addition, the Intel-based model could be configured with up to 1.5TB of RAM, which is 8× as much as the 192GB maximum for the Apple silicon model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are certainly advantages to the new Mac Pro and its unified architecture. For example, Apple says the new Mac Pro is up to 3× faster than the Intel-based model for certain real-world workflows like video transcoding and 3D simulations. For video processing, Apple says the new Mac Pro's performance is equivalent to an Intel-based model with seven <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW682AM/A/apple-afterburner-card\">Afterburner cards</a>. For overall CPU performance, the new Mac Pro's $6,999 base model is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/10/m2-ultra-chip-benchmarks/\">up to 2× faster</a> than a 28-core Intel-based Mac Pro, which started at $12,999.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Mac Pro is available to order now, and launches in stores on Tuesday. Customers who don't need PCI Express expansion should <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-studio-vs-mac-pro/\">consider the Mac Studio</a>, which can be configured with the M2 Ultra chip for $3,000 less than the Mac Pro.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro\">Mac Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1\">Mac Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/11/apple-exec-discusses-mac-pro-lack-of-egpu-support/\">Apple Executive Discusses New Mac Pro's Lack of Graphics Card Support</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-executive-discusses-new-mac-pros-lack-of-graphics-card-support.2392550/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cf3ad7548b6eda22354c25f30e577574ad5a0701df4011218e3ab36a77eda037","category":"Apple"}
