How about a limited “Pro Racing Team” edition?</span></p>\n<p><span>Bianchi fans will be happy to know the Specialissima Pro Racing Team frame dons the Italian brand’s iconic celeste paint, hand-painted in Italy by Bianchi. Yes, Bianchi offers the Specialissima in a full-celeste paint scheme, but that paint is about 80g heavier than the ultralight black frame (at a claimed 750g for a 55cm frame). </span></p>\n<p><span>Think of this special edition frameset as having your cake and eating it too; you get to enjoy a bit of celeste without sacrificing the frame’s lightweight composition.</span></p>\n<p><span>In a nod to the potential collectible nature of the frame, a press release from Bianchi suggests that “this frame is not only for collectors but also intended for road use, combining aesthetic refinement, low weight, and sport performance.” </span></p>\n<p><span>Every frameset comes with a Specialissima Pro Racing Team brochure and a brand new coffee table book called “Casa Bianchi.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Want to collect an extra special Specialissiima Pro Racing Team for yourself?
