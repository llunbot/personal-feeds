Apple's in-house modem will then be joined by a secondary Apple-made Wi-Fi 7 chip in the iPhone 17 Pro in the second half of 2025. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-apple-wifi-7-chip-rumor/\">previously said</a> that iPhone 17 Pro models in 2025 will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, which matches his latest expectations for adoption. Pu believes that both custom modem and Wi-Fi 7 chips will achieve majority adoption in iPhones by 2027.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu's forecast also tallies with predictions recently made by Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. On <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/kuo-says-apple-5g-and-wifi-chips-are-separate/\">Thursday</a>, Kuo said that at least one iPhone 17 model launching next year will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip. Kuo also expects Apple's 5G modem to be used in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/\">rumored ultra-thin iPhone 17 model</a>.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/22/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/\">iPhone 17 Air: Everything We Know About Apple's Slim iPhone</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nKuo believes that Apple's 5G and Wi-Fi chips are currently two different chips that will gradually be used in new products simultaneously starting in the second half of 2025. The early switch-over timelines will differ due to separate production schedules, according to Kuo. As Pu also suggests, the iPhone SE 4 will move to an Apple 5G modem but still use a Broadcom Wi-Fi chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's shift to develop its own modem and Wi-Fi chip technology would be a significant strategic move. Currently, Apple relies on Qualcomm to supply its modems, and Broadcom for its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth components. For example, all four iPhone 16 models already support Wi-Fi 7 with Broadcom's chip, but with some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/m4-mac-models-no-wi-fi-7/\">limited specifications</a>. By creating its own equivalents, Apple aims to reduce dependency on third-parties, gain more control over the technology, and potentially lower costs in the long run.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe fourth-generation iPhone SE is expected to have a similar design as the base iPhone 14, with rumored features including a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a newer A-series chip, a USB-C port, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM to enable Apple Intelligence support, and of course the first-ever Apple-designed 5G modem. The new iPhone SE is expected to be released in the first half of 2025, with a launch in March or April most likely.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/\">Apple 5G Modem</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wi-fi-7/\">Wi-Fi 7</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/iphone-se-4-5g-modem-jeff-pu/\">iPhone SE 4 First to Get Apple-Designed 5G Modem, iPhone 17 Pro to Add Custom Wi-Fi 7 Chip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-first-to-get-apple-designed-5g-modem-iphone-17-pro-to-add-custom-wi-fi-7-chip.2441686/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9783c4147e8c3ff10bdec4a97e7f1f16af17041a5bf3e394eb37a1fa6954ad17","category":"Apple"}
