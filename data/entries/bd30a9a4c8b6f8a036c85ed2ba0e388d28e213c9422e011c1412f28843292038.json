and greatest swag to arrive at BikeRadar towers.</p>\n<p>Before we get into that, though, let’s recap some of the week’s biggest stories and reviews.</p>\n<p>It’s been an action-packed week on BikeRadar, with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-de-france-bikes/\">Tour de France</a> understandably dominating many of the headlines.</p>\n<p>This week, we’ve taken a close look at <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/caleb-ewan-ridley-prototype/\">Caleb Ewan’s prototype lightweight, all-rounder Ridley</a>, and the new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/tadej-pogacar-enve-handlebar-tour-de-france/\">ENVE integrated handlebar</a> adorning Tadej Pogačar’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/colnago-v4rs-dura-ace-di2-review/\">Colnago V4Rs</a>.</p>\n<p>Over on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/bikeradar\">BikeRadar YouTube channel</a>, we’ve got coverage of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hw-_D8nwd9s\">the hottest custom bikes at this year’s race</a>, as well as deep dives into some of the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uKyZq0zxj64\">new and unreleased bikes</a> we spotted at the Grand Depart in Bilbao, Spain.</p>\n<p>Just in case you were curious, our team of experts also revealed who <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tallest-pro-cyclist/\">the tallest cyclist at the Tour de France</a> is, and why it matters.</p>\n<p>Away from road racing, BikeRadar’s senior technical editor, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/alexevans/\">Alex Evans</a>, has been dutifully testing mountain bike flat pedals, and this week saw reviews of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/pembree-d2a-flat-pedals-review/\">Pembree D2A</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/race-face-atlas-flat-pedal-review/\">Race Face Atlas</a> published.</p>\n<p>A review of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/focus-jam2-sl-9-9-review/\">Focus JAM2 SL 9.9 electric mountain bike</a> also went live this week, with Alex praising the bike’s performance and versatility.</p>\n<p>Over on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/listen-to-bikeradar-podcast/\">BikeRadar podcast</a>, BikeRadar’s in-house foodie, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/tommarvin/\">Tom Marvin</a>, spoke to celebrity chef and environmental campaigner <a href=\"https://megaphone.link/GLT3894243877\">Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</a>.</p>\n<p>Joined by Darron Coppin, of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/sven-cycles-swift-first-ride-review/\">Sven Cycles</a>, and BikeRadar’s senior technical editor <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/warrenrossiter/\">Warren Rossiter</a>, the four talk about Hugh’s custom-built River Cottage Rambler electric bike.</p>\n\n<h2>Bont

years since Bont last updated the Vaypor, its flagship <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-cycling-shoes/\">road cycling shoe</a>.</p>\n<p>The snappily named Vaypor 2023 continues with Bont’s signature bathtub-style carbon sole, but gets an updated and simplified closure system, sheds a little weight, and has some extra quality-of-life features.</p>\n<p>Bont also says it has updated its last (the model foot around which a shoe is built) to suit a wider range of foot shapes.</p>\n<p>Because of this, Bont says the Vaypor 2023 shouldn’t need heat-moulding for most people, though that is still an option for those who want to.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bont Vaypor 2023 white cycling shoes\" title=\"Bont Vaypor 2023 white cycling

features two BOA Li2 rotary dials, in a simpler arrangement than on the previous Vaypor S.</p>\n<p>Bont has also introduced adjustable cleat bolt holes, a feature borrowed from its more budget-oriented <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/bont-motion-review/\">Motion shoe</a>.</p>\n<p>This can be useful because it gives a much wider range of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-install-and-adjust-cycling-cleats/\">cleat positions</a>, which can be important for an optimal <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-position/\">bike fit</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bont Vaypor 2023 white cycling shoes\" title=\"Bont

On our scales, our size EU45 pair weighs 442g.</p>\n<p>As a point of comparison, the size EU45 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/bont-vaypor-s-hologram-shoes-review/\">Vaypor S Hologram</a> shoes we tested in 2021 weighed 484.6g.</p>\n<p>Available in white or black, the Bont Vaypor 2023s cost £369.95/$449.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Bont Vaypor 2023:</strong> £369.95/$449</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n\n<h2>LifeLine Pro Bike Workstand</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"LifeLine Pro Bike Workstand\" title=\"LifeLine Pro Bike Workstand\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> LifeLine’s Pro Bike Workstand is a high-end bike repair stand with a competitive price.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A dedicated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-repair-stand/\">bike repair stand</a> is an invaluable tool for any <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/common-home-maintenance-mistakes/\">home mechanic</a>, so when my Aldi middle-aisle special workstand gave up the ghost recently, I immediately went looking for a replacement.</p>\n<p>As with most products, there’s a wide range of options and prices available, but LifeLine’s Pro Bike Workstand seemed to tick most of the right boxes at a glance.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"LifeLine Pro Bike Workstand\" title=\"LifeLine Pro Bike Workstand\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The build features plenty of metal for improved durability.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It has a rugged build quality, with plenty of metal and heavy-duty plastic.

claimed capacity of 40kg.</p>\n<p>That’s more than enough to cope with every <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bike</a> I own (even the ones with <a

time trial of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-de-france-2022-tech-trends/\">2022 Tour de France</a>.</p>\n<p>Curiously, Kask is tight-lipped about the purpose and performance benefit of the Aero Pro Visor compared to the standard visor.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that Dan Bigham and Filippo Ganna both used it to break the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/filippo-ganna-pinarello-hour-record-bike/\">UCI Hour Record</a>, there was no official launch or press release from Kask claiming huge wattage gains
