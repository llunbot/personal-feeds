The ad is citing old figures that were reported on all the way back <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/microsoft-surface-pro-faster-macbook-air/\">in May 2024</a>, so take that as you will.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the ad is using an older MacBook Air for comparison purposes, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/windows/copilotplus-claims?tabs=amd\">Microsoft's fine print</a> does say some Copilot+ PCs are still faster than even the latest MacBook Air models with the M4 chip, based on the same Cinebench 2024 benchmark.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nSome of the Copilot+ PCs that were tested include Lenovo's Yoga Slim 7x with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite processor, Microsoft's Surface Laptop with the Snapdragon X Elite, and HP's OmniBook Ultra 14 with AMD's Ryzen AI 9 HX 375.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile it is true that some PC chips are faster than Apple silicon chips in certain tests, Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-introduces-m4-pro-and-m4-max/\">said</a> the M4 family of chips continues to offer industry-leading performance per watt. This impressive power efficiency results in the MacBook Air having fast performance, long battery life, and a thin and light design without an internal fan.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the end, using Windows over macOS remains a dealbreaker for some customers regardless.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/windows/\">Windows</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/microsoft-were-faster-than-a-mac-ad/\">Microsoft Says 'We're Faster Than a Mac' in Latest Windows PC Ad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-says-were-faster-than-a-mac-in-latest-windows-pc-ad.2457150/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"050c067a541a3300a8ff557cec8cd4c9b2dab39dcfaeb9cbaab6e8ab62b696f8","category":"Apple"}
