These casts, usually milled from a solid piece of aluminum, are designed to help accessory makers ensure that their products will precisely fit the final devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe dummy models provide a clear look at the all-new \"Capture\" button across all four models, which is expected to control various photography and videography functions. The slightly larger size of the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max is also evident due to the rumored display size increase from 6.1- to 6.3-inches and 6.7- to 6.9-inches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iphone-16-dummy-models-side-view.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThey also show the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus's vertical rear camera array and Action button. While the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max gained the Action button last year, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus still have the traditional mute switch. The ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup is expected to debut in the fall. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonny-dickson/\">Sonny Dickson</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-design-showcased-by-dummy-models/\">iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro Design Showcased By Dummy Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-and-iphone-16-pro-design-showcased-by-dummy-models.2423501/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"616a8b6c63599fca87f528e9edaae7483d13f69f5e7153b23c3b4a3a1b62407a","category":"Apple"}
