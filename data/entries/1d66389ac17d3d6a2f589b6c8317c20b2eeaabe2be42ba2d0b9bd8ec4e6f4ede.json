{"title":"PSA: You'll Have to Visit an Apple Store If You Forget Your Vision Pro Passcode","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/05/vision-pro-passcode-apple-store/","date":1707182683000,"content":"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a> owners who forget the passcode they set will need to take the device to an Apple retail location to get it reset, reports <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-05/forgot-your-apple-vision-pro-s-passcode-you-may-have-to-take-it-back-to-store\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. There is apparently no on-device way to reset a Vision Pro passcode if it is forgotten.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Purple-Feature-2.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nBy default, the Vision Pro asks for a six-digit passcode when it is being set up, which must be entered twice. Customers can opt for a longer or shorter passcode. Optic ID can be used in lieu of a passcode, but it works like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a>, and the passcode is required after a restart and in certain other situations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCustomers who have forgotten their Vision Pro passcodes have been told by Apple that they will need to visit a retail store for a fix or will need to ship the headset to Apple if there isn't a nearby store. Like Apple's iOS devices, the incorrect passcode cannot be entered too many times or the device will be disabled, with a waiting period before a passcode can be entered again. Removing the passcode requires erasing all content on the Vision Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> also must be erased to get rid of a passcode, but it is a process that can be done at home with a Mac or PC. The Apple Watch, which cannot connect to a Mac or PC, can be reset on the device itself using the Digital Crown or on a connected ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is an erase content setting on the Vision Pro, but there is no way to get into the reset mode using a combination of button presses. Erasing Vision Pro can only be done through the Settings app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCustomers who have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-selling-vision-pro-developer-strap/\">the $300 Developer Strap</a> may be able to wipe the device from a Mac, but most users will not be able to get this accessory as it is limited to registered developers in the United States.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/05/vision-pro-passcode-apple-store/\">PSA: You'll Have to Visit an Apple Store If You Forget Your Vision Pro Passcode</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-youll-have-to-visit-an-apple-store-if-you-forget-your-vision-pro-passcode.2418592/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1d66389ac17d3d6a2f589b6c8317c20b2eeaabe2be42ba2d0b9bd8ec4e6f4ede","category":"Apple"}
