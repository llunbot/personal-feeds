The feature works when a ‌HomePod‌ or ‌HomePod mini‌ is paired to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> and used as the audio output option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrior to now, Enhance Dialogue was available on the second-generation ‌HomePod‌, and it was a feature that was first introduced in tvOS 17. With tvOS 17.1 and ‌HomePod‌ software 17.1, Enhance Dialogue can be enabled on any ‌HomePod‌ (or set of HomePods) paired to an ‌Apple TV‌ 4K.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEnabling Enhance Dialogue can be done by playing a TV show or movie, bringing up the playback controls with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> Remote, and choosing the Enhance Dialogue feature from the Audio Options button. It can be enabled for all content by going to Settings &gt; Video and Audio &gt; Enhance Dialogue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple today seeded the final beta version of the ‌HomePod‌ 17.1 software, and it should see a release as soon as next week alongside iOS 17.1 and tvOS 17.1.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/homepod-software-17-1-enhance-dialogue/\">Upcoming 17.1 Software Brings Enhance Dialogue to Original HomePod and HomePod mini</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/upcoming-17-1-software-brings-enhance-dialogue-to-original-homepod-and-homepod-mini.2407885/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"68da47212feb0ca2b140138faba343e71534a6edda402cc904cec397a986b870","category":"Apple"}
