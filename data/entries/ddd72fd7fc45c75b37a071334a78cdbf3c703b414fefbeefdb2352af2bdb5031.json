It was a significant cause for concern, as a large population of susceptible animals could act as a reservoir that allows the virus to spread back to humans.</p>\n<p>At the time, however, uncertainties abounded. The study looked at only a small sample of the deer population of one state—we didn't know how the animals were exposed, and we didn't know whether the virus was actually spreading among wild deer. Since then, a few of the blanks have been filled in. Critically, deer-to-deer transmission has been observed in captivity. On Monday, a <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.31.466677v1\">preprint of a new paper</a> answered some more questions, showing that infection is widespread in a second state, driven both by its spread from humans and deer-to-deer transmission.</p>\n<p>Overall, the news is not especially good, though we still don't understand what risks it may pose to humans.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809741#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809741&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ddd72fd7fc45c75b37a071334a78cdbf3c703b414fefbeefdb2352af2bdb5031","category":"Tech"}
