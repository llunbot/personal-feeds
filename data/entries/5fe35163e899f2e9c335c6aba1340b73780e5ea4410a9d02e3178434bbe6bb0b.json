Apple is planning to implement sideloading support to comply with the new European regulations by next year, according to Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has claimed that sideloading will \"undermine the privacy and security protections\" that iPhone users rely on, leaving people vulnerable to malware, scams, data tracking, and other issues. However, Apple must comply with the DMA or it risks fines of as much as 20 percent of its global revenue if the EU laws are violated. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-13/will-apple-allow-users-to-install-third-party-app-stores-sideload-in-europe\">December 2022 report</a> Gurman said Apple was considering implementing security requirements such as verification, a process that it could charge a fee for in lieu of collecting money from app sales. Apple has a verification system on Mac that allows users to be safe while giving them access to apps outside of the Mac App Store.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf other countries introduce similar legislation, alternate app stores could expand beyond the European Union. The United States, for example, is considering legislation that would require Apple to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/26/apple-statement-revised-sideloading-bill/\">allow sideloading</a>. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/\">iOS 17 to Support App Sideloading to Comply With European Regulations</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-to-support-app-sideloading-to-comply-with-european-regulations.2387025/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5fe35163e899f2e9c335c6aba1340b73780e5ea4410a9d02e3178434bbe6bb0b","category":"Apple"}
