He did not explain what the cameras would be used for.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe tiny cameras would not be for taking photos, but rather serve as infrared sensors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a June 2024 blog post, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple planned to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/new-airpods-to-feature-ir-cameras/\">mass produce new AirPods with infrared cameras by 2026</a>. He said the infrared camera component would be similar to the iPhone's Face ID receiver.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo said the new AirPods with infrared cameras would provide an enhanced spatial audio experience with the Apple Vision Pro headset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"For example, when a user is watching a video with Vision Pro and wearing this new AirPods, if users turn their heads to look in a specific direction, the sound source in that direction can be emphasized to enhance the spatial audio/computing experience,\" wrote Kuo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe infrared cameras could potentially enable \"in-air gesture control\" as well, allowing for device interaction with hand movements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf the alleged 2026 mass production timeframe remains on schedule, the new AirPods with infrared cameras could launch in 2026 or 2027.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/26/apple-exploring-airpods-with-tiny-cameras/\">Apple Still 'Exploring' New AirPods With Tiny Cameras</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-exploring-new-airpods-with-tiny-cameras.2448148/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b99ff5877be833d1b7e5b91eace617b550bd312ff7f21cf7b74dc3f66b8a4ca8","category":"Apple"}
