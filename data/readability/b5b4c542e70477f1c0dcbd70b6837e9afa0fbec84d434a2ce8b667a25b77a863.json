Effective today, CyclingTips, as well as its sister sites PinkBike and Trailforks, have been acquired by <a href=\"https://www.pocketoutdoormedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Outside</a>. </p><p>What does this mean for the CyclingTips community? In the short term, not much. The same site you know and love will not change overnight. Looking further out, the stability and resources that come with Outside will allow us to do what we’ve always done – work at building a better CyclingTips. Better for our members, readers, and industry partners.</p><p>There’s lots to work through. We’re always cooking up ambitious plans and and, as a part of the CyclingTips Community, you’ll be the first to hear about them.</p><p>The small team here at CyclingTips has a simple goal every day when we come to work. We want to showcase the most beautiful sport on earth in a way that ultimately pulls you away from your computer or phone and gets you out for a ride. That is our purpose. Our goal has never been to become the biggest. We aspire to reach other goals and milestones. But in order for us to infect as many people as possible with the same passion we have for this sport, we need to reach as many people as we can. This partnership with Outside progresses us towards that goal.</p><p>Thank you for supporting CyclingTips and for making us a part of your cycling life, and for being part of ours. </p><p>If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to email me at editor@cyclingtips.com and I’ll do my best to get back to each and every one of you.</p><p><em>You can read the Outside announcement <a href=\"https://www.pocketoutdoormedia.com/outside-acquires-pinkbike-cycling-tips-and-trailforks\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em></p></div></div>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"b5b4c542e70477f1c0dcbd70b6837e9afa0fbec84d434a2ce8b667a25b77a863","category":"Cycling"}
