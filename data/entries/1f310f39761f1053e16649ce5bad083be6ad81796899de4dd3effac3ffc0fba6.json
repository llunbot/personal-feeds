{"title":"Play — Watch Later App for YouTube (and Other) Videos","link":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1596506190","date":1681773519000,"content":"\n<p>Another deceptively simple, very well-crafted app I’ve been meaning to recommend: Play, a “watch later” app by <a href=\"https://marcosatanaka.com/\">Marcos Tanaka</a>. Play is a great native app on iOS and Mac, and includes a Share sheet extension for adding new videos to your queue. You can categorize videos with tags, but that’s not necessary. What I really like is that Play is also a great app on Apple TV. I queue videos from my Mac and iPhone, then watch them later on my TV. I like this way better than using YouTube itself. One-time purchase of $3 gets you access to Play across all platforms. (That’s too cheap — I wish it cost more.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/12/15/zinc\">For years</a> I’d been using an app called <a href=\"https://zinc.video/\">Zinc</a> for the same purpose, but I find myself using Play more than I ever used Zinc, because it has a Mac app, and Play’s Share sheet interface is better than Zinc’s bookmarklet. Play pulls in all sorts of metadata from YouTube automatically — it’s just great. (Zinc still works, if you have it installed, but it appears that the app is no longer available in the App Store.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/17/play\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1f310f39761f1053e16649ce5bad083be6ad81796899de4dd3effac3ffc0fba6","category":"Tech"}
