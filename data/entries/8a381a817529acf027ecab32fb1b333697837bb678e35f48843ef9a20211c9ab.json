{"title":"Everything New in iOS 15.1 Beta 1","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/everything-new-in-ios-15-1-beta-1/","date":1632252940000,"content":"Just a day after releasing the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a> updates, Apple has already seeded the first betas of iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1. The new updates reintroduce features like SharePlay, and below, we have a list of what's new.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iOS-15.1-Everything-New-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>SharePlay</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/ios-15-1-shareplay-reenabled/\">SharePlay is enabled</a> in the iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, and tvOS 15.1 betas to allow Apple to further work out bugs to get the feature ready to launch. Apple decided to pull SharePlay from the ‌iOS 15‌ launch because it was not properly functioning and was still riddled with issues.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/ios15-shareplay.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAvailable in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>, SharePlay is designed to let users call up their friends and family and then watch TV, watch movies, and listen to music together using neat features like shared playlists and TV show syncing for all users. SharePlay also allows for screen sharing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf testing goes well, SharePlay could see an official launch in iOS 15.1.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Announce Calls</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nIn the Settings for the Phone app, there's a new icon for the \"Announce Calls\" setting.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/new-announce-calls-icon-ios-15.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Lossless Audio for HomePod</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/homepod-15-1-beta-lossless-dolby-atmos/\">HomePod 15.1 beta</a> that accompanies the iOS 15.1 beta adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio support to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Vaccine Cards in Wallet</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nIn ‌iOS 15‌, verifiable health records can be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/ios-15-vaccine-card-wallet-app/\">downloaded and stored</a> in the Health app, and this includes COVID-19 vaccination records and health results. In iOS 15.1, vaccination records are able to be added to the Wallet app so a vaccine card can be provided to businesses, restaurants, venues, and more where vaccines are required for entry.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSee our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/ios-15-vaccine-card-wallet-app/\">previous article</a> for more details and discussion. Discussion should be limited to the ‌iOS 15‌ update and political comments will be immediately removed. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Other Features</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nKnow of a feature that we left out?
