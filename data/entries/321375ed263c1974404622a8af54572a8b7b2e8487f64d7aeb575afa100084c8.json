If you've ever used some specific entries in Google's<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/\"> lengthy instant messaging lineup</a>, namely Google Talk (2005-2013) or Google Hangouts (2013-2022), the photos you shared with contacts landed in a space called the \"Album Archive.\" Album Archive is <a href=\"https://support.google.com/picasa/answer/7008270?hl=en\">being shut down</a> this Wednesday, July 19, and the data in it is being deleted.</p>\n<p>Google's communication around this has not been great. The support page says: \"Content thatâ€™s only available in Album Archive will be deleted starting July 19, 2023,\" but it's unclear what that data is. Google says that \"some Google Hangouts data from Album Archive\" will be deleted, but also that \"most Google Hangouts images and videos are still available and were migrated to Google Chat.\" (Google Chat is Google's current instant messenger platform, which launched and replaced Hangouts in 2021.) Other content that might get deleted includes \"rare cases like small thumbnail photos and album comments or likes\" and \"background images uploaded in the Gmail theme picker prior to 2018.\"</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chrome_CAkaFs95er.png\"><img alt=\"The Album Archive.
