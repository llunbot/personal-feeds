Astana’s Fabio Aru attacked race leader <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/chris-froome\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Froome</a> of Team Sky as he raised his hand for a mechanical. Froome’s teammate Geraint Thomas abandoned after a crash, as did BMC Racing’s Richie Porte. And in the finale, Rigoberto Urán (Cannondale-Drapac) got stuck in the single 53/11 gear, but somehow managed a bike throw on the line to take the win just ahead of Sunweb’s Warren Barguil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t a disappointing day for the Frenchman, however. Having made it into the breakaway on a stage with seven classified climbs, three at <em>hors categorie</em> classification, Barguil led over the Grand Colombier and the Mont du Chat to take maximum mountain points and thrust himself into the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/history-of-the-tour-de-france-jerseys\" target=\"_blank\">polka dot jersey</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He would reach even greater heights four stages later.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>A victory to celebrate</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20170714TDF8171-A.S.O._Pauline_Ballet-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"warren barguil outsprints the breakaway to win a stage of the tour de france in the polka dot jersey\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20170714TDF8171-A.S.O._Pauline_Ballet-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20170714TDF8171-A.S.O._Pauline_Ballet-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20170714TDF8171-A.S.O._Pauline_Ballet-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20170714TDF8171-A.S.O._Pauline_Ballet-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20170714TDF8171-A.S.O._Pauline_Ballet-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20170714TDF8171-A.S.O._Pauline_Ballet-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20170714TDF8171-A.S.O._Pauline_Ballet-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20170714TDF8171-A.S.O._Pauline_Ballet-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20170714TDF8171-A.S.O._Pauline_Ballet-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20170714TDF8171-A.S.O._Pauline_Ballet-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Pauline Ballet</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A French rider winning a stage in the French Grand Tour on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bastille-day-at-the-tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Bastille Day</a> – it doesn’t happen often, but when it does it’s a memorable occasion. Stage 13 on 14<sup>th</sup> July 2017 was short at just 101km, but it packed in a series of Category 1 climbs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alberto Contador (Trek-Segafredo) and Mikel Landa (Team Sky) broke away from the main bunch, encouraging Barguil to team up with Movistar’s Nairo Quintana to chase them down. The two pairs eventually merged to form a quartet, and Barguil added to his lead in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fix-king-of-the-mountains-polka-dot-jersey-tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">mountains classification</a>, taking maximum points on the final climb, the Mur de Péguère. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a lengthy 25km descent to the finish in Foix that followed. All would sprint for the victory, but Barguil shot around the corner with his head in the wind and never relented, crossing the line to become the first Breton stage winner since 1993 and the first Frenchman to win on Bastille Day for 12 years.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related

18, the final mountain day at the 2017 Tour, featured the <em>hors categorie</em> <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/col-d-izoard-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Col d’Izoard</a> as a summit finish for the first time. A well-represented 50-man breakaway (only three teams didn’t make the cut, Team Sky included) got away from the main peloton, which included Barguil and the main GC favourites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in the final kilometres, Barguil attacked, shaking off Contador and hoovering up every man in the splintered breakaway.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was in the final kilometre of the Izoard that the lead rider on the road, UAE Team Emirates’s Darwin Atapuma, had his heart broken as Barguil sailed past to claim his second stage victory of the Tour. With only a hilly day and a time-trial remaining before the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-final-stage-procession\" target=\"_blank\">processional Stage 21 to Paris</a>, the polka dot jersey was as good as his. He just had to finish the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barguil got through the final stages unscathed and amassed an 89-point lead in the mountains classification ahead of Primož Roglič (LottoNL-Jumbo). He would also make it into the top ten on general classification. Barguil’s Sunweb squad had other successes in 2017 as well, with sprinter Michael Matthews winning two stages and seeing off competition from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/marcel-kittel-pau\" target=\"_blank\">Marcel Kittel</a> (QuickStep Floors) to win the green jersey of the points classification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top his race off, Barguil was also awarded the super-combativity award for the Tour, although the decision proved to be somewhat controversial. Thomas De Gendt of Lotto-Soudal had spent over 1,000km in the breakaway in addition to winning the same number of daily combativity awards as Barguil (one each); the public vote suggested the Belgian should have taken the accolade too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, there was no doubting that Barguil was the deserving winner of the polka dot jersey, and by being the only Frenchman to have won on Bastille Day since 2005, his legendary status was assured.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/warren-barguil-tour-de-france-2017\">Flashback Friday: Warren Barguil wins in polka dots on Bastille Day in 2017</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"8b57cea1ff6841ffb59a17877b54cbfa149533a528b5ccd7f5277959b657ed4b","category":"Cycling"}
