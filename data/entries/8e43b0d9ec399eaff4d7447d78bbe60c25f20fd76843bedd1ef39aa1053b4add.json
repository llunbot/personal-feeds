Founded by three friends in 2014, the brand aims to create functional garments with practical features that improve the riding experience in a region where riders can encounter all four seasons in one day. Albion also has an environmental mission, with its own in-house responsibility commitment to ensure all products are well made, last longer, and manufactured using responsible fabric solutions.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have the brand’s ARB1 bib shorts in for review, and while I put those bibs through their paces in the changeable Irish weather conditions, Albion also sent its Burner lightweight and packable insulating layer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have watched the Tour de France or Giro d’Italia, you’ll most likely have seen riders stuff newspapers down the front of their jerseys just before a long descent for an extra layer of insulation and to block the wind. Albion’s Burner is the 21st-century version of this pro cycling tradition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Albion says it designed the Burner “to give the rider quick and easy access to an ultra-light, highly packable insulating layer to add rapid warmth and wind block to any outfit.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first I thought the Burner was a little gimmicky, but after a few rides it had me wondering why no one has done this before (<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/spotlight-warmfront-chest-warmer/\" target=\"_blank\">it turns out Warmfront has</a>). The Burner sits between a base layer and the bib straps and provides a surprising amount of insulation for a layer weighing just 18 grams. As packable as it is lightweight, the Burner easily scrunches into its own pocket and is about the size of a mini-bake or small energy bar. Packed away like this, it takes up minimal space in a jersey pocket, but I found it stored just as easily and quite securely between my saddle and saddlebag. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the sustainability front, Albion uses 100% recycled nylon outer fabric and an insulating layer made with 90% recycled fibres. Furthermore, Albion offers free lifetime repairs on all garments to ensure garments last longer, in turn creating less waste and, perhaps counterintuitively for a clothing brand, fewer purchases. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found the Burner an excellent addition to my wardrobe as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/how-to-layer-for-cold-weather-riding/\">a layering</a> item for spring, autumn, or just Irish summers. While not a replacement for all wind vests/gilets, the Burner’s ability to give added protection in a much smaller package made it a new must-have for me. I found it perfect for early morning rides when I knew it would heat up later in the day, and for days slightly too chilly for just a jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Irish climate, I don’t often get to wear a short sleeve jersey as my outermost layer; the Burner has given me that option by placing that removable insulating layer beneath the jersey. Racers could find a similar benefit with the Burner – they can keep their aero jerseys and race suits as the outermost layer with the Burner sat below for that thermal protection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Removing the Burner is simple with just a one-handed pull through the front of a jersey. However, putting it in place requires a little more precision. This is still achievable on the move for anyone comfortable riding no-handed, but the Burner does need placing below the bib straps to hold it in place, and I feel it would benefit from being a bit wider to facilitate this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Burner is available in three colours, mist (white), black, and pine green, and is priced at £35 (US$45 / AU$61 / €38). You can learn more at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.albioncycling.com/product/burner-black/\">Albioncycling.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n    <div>\n    <div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<p><em>Follow the link to see previous products we’ve reviewed in our <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/tag/spotlight/%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\">Spotlight series</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n    </div>\n    </div>\n\t\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/spotlight-albions-tradition-killing-burner-packable-wind-blocker/\">Read More</a>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"8e43b0d9ec399eaff4d7447d78bbe60c25f20fd76843bedd1ef39aa1053b4add","category":"Cycling"}
