According to Lin, Apple has ordered between 80 to 90 million ‌iPhone 15‌ units for this period, a downturn from the 90 to 100 million units placed for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> models last year. Leading the order share is the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max, followed in succession by the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, ‌iPhone 15‌, and the ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-pro-models-expected-to-be-more-expensive/\">Previous forecasts</a> suggested the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max will be at least $100 more expensive than their predecessors. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> starts at $999 and the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max starts at $1,099, meaning the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ could start at $1,099 to $1,199 and the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max could start at $1,199 to $1,299.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this year, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> reported that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/apple-price-hike-iphone-15-pro-models/\">contemplating raising the price</a> for both the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max. Analyst Jeff Pu has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-15-pro-max-more-expensive/\">also said</a> that the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models could be more expensive than the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ models. He believes the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ will be priced starting at $1,099, up from the $999 starting price of the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌. The entire ‌iPhone 15‌ lineup are widely expected to be unveiled at Apple's \"Wonderlust\" event on Tuesday, September 12.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLin added that upstream supply chain information indicates that Apple will increase the display sizes of both Pro models next year, mirroring <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/\">other rumors</a> claiming that the two devices will increase from display sizes of 6.1- and 6.7-inches to 6.3- and 6.9-inches.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/major-price-hike-rumored-for-iphone-15-pro-models/\">'Major Price Hike' Again Rumored for iPhone 15 Pro Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/major-price-hike-again-rumored-for-iphone-15-pro-models.2400417/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"213170eec5d631e34669b2e05982b81ae87c607a75c004ec036380ff051c7bce","category":"Apple"}
