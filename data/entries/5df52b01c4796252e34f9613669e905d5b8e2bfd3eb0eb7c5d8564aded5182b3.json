After this, VSS<em> Unity</em> glided back to the runway in New Mexico, testing modifications to the spacecraft's flight controls and handling.</p>\n<p>After the test, Virgin Galactic said the glide flight closes its \"final validation test points\" of a campaign to ensure the aircraft and space plane are ready to resume powered flights. To that end, the company said data collected during the flight will be analyzed in the coming weeks, and assuming the review goes well, the next mission will be a powered spaceflight.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934581#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934581&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5df52b01c4796252e34f9613669e905d5b8e2bfd3eb0eb7c5d8564aded5182b3","category":"Tech"}
