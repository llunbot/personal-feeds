Now, though, the better question might be whether the world ever needs a new game console with a built-in disc drive at all.</p>\n<p>Yesterday's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/\">announcement of the PlayStation 5 Pro</a> seemed to treat the existence of disc-based games as an afterthought.

But now, just one year later, Sony has decided that it only needs a single \"disc-less\" model of the PS5 Pro as the default.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049096#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049096&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8e92c28402145934cf6d253f6765cd3ee9da969913d8faa49e7fe2dc078df1e9","category":"Tech"}
