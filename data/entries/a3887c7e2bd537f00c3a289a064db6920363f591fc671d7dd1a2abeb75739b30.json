And Sunday’s men’s race will be the first edition of the beloved French classic in more than 900 days – the reigning champion is<em> still</em> Philippe Gilbert, if you can believe it, way back in April 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if that’s not enough to whet your appetite, this will: it might be a wet one. There’s rain forecast before the women’s race on Saturday, and during the men’s race on Sunday, with blustery conditions also possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Tuesday, Les Amis de Paris-Roubaix (the Friends of Paris-Roubaix) completed their traditional pre-race inspection of the course, and they had a bigger job than usual on their hands to prepare the cobbles for the riders. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>The Trouée d’Arenberg looks extra hellish at the moment. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png\" /><br /><br />Credit: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kwiato?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@kwiato</a>’s IG Story <a href=\"https://t.co/QFzrDVe6TG\">pic.twitter.com/QFzrDVe6TG</a></p>— CyclingTips (@cyclingtips) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cyclingtips/status/1440376071262670854?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 21, 2021</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>The Trouee d’Arenberg – one of three five star sectors, denoting its difficulty – was a vibrant emerald green, covered with weeds and moss. That sector needed weeding, cleaning and a mechanical brusher vehicle to get it back to a rideable condition.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Arenberg [Forest] needed a big clean-up,” race director Thierry Gouvenou told local media. “The cobbles haven’t been raced on for 900 days and so they were very green, with weeds everywhere, so we’ve had to do a big clean-up along the route.” Gouvenou told local media after his reconnaissance. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f60e.png\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/TkvoIIatCP\">pic.twitter.com/TkvoIIatCP</a></p>— Les Amis de Paris-Roubaix (@A_ParisRoubaix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/A_ParisRoubaix/status/1442845438684565520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 28, 2021</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>There will be more weeding and maintenance required on the course before this weekend, while teams have already begun to converge on northern France for recon rides. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last wet Paris-Roubaix was held in 2002, and saw Johan Museeuw win his third cobblestone trophy. In the years since, a succession of warm springs has meant Paris-Roubaix has been a dry and dusty affair for almost two decades. With this year’s unusual shift in the calendar, however, the drought might be over.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/the-cobbles-of-paris-roubaix-are-waiting/\">Read More</a>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"a3887c7e2bd537f00c3a289a064db6920363f591fc671d7dd1a2abeb75739b30","category":"Cycling"}
