But that crackdown hasn't stopped the Xbox emulation community, which this weekend launched <a href=\"https://xbemu.me/\">a new version of those \"retail mode\" emulators</a> that they're confident will be able to evade Microsoft's automatic detection and removal tools.\n<p>The newly accessible emulators come courtesy of the \"UWeaPons Store,\" a name that references the Universal Windows Platform program that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/my-confusing-10-day-journey-to-getting-a-uwp-game-to-work-on-windows-10/\">allows generic Windows apps to be distributed to Xbox consoles</a> in the first place.
