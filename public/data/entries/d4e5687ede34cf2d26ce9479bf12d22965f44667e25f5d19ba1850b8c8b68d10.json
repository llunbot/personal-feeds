The\nlibrary offers screenshots of the Mac’s operating system dating\nback to the Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000, and we’re such fans that\nRogue Amoeba has sponsored it for several years now. It‘s often\nhelpful as a reference, but it’s also simply enjoyable to look\nback at the way things once were.</p>\n\n<p>Amazingly, Rogue Amoeba’s own story dates back nearly as far as\nMac OS X’s. We opened our virtual doors in 2002, and since then,\nwe’ve shipped nearly 1,000 different versions across our product\nlineup. Given that amount of history, we thought it would be both\nuseful and fun to document our own products.</p>\n\n<p>Late last year, we asked Stephen if he’d help us spin up our own\narchive. He was up for the challenge, so we provided him with a\npile of important releases, and he set to work documenting them\nwith his array of old Macs. When Stephen was done, he provided us\nwith a large collection of screenshots, sorted by product and\nversion.</p>\n\n<p>Our team then curated these images and built a way to show them\noff. We created galleries for each product and dug up details and\nstories about each individual update. It was a lot of work, but\nthe end result feels weighty, a worthwhile repository of much of\nour company’s history.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is just wonderful. A few thoughts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Be careful if you’ve got work on your plate today. You can lose an hour or two with this gallery, easy.</li>\n<li>In hindsight it’s surprising to me how quickly Mac OS X’s pinstripes faded away. In my memory, those strong pinstripes were there for an entire era, but in reality, they started fading with each major Mac OS X release after 10.0, and by 2004 were gone.</li>\n<li>I really miss UI design that made controls obvious. Clear affordances. All buttons obviously buttons, all text input fields obviously text input fields. Pop-up menus that are obviously pop-up menus (today’s MacOS 13 is chock full of pop-up menus that only reveal themselves as pop-ups when you hover over them). 20 years ago we bent over backwards to make the purpose of every control as obvious as possible; the style today is to make everything look like flat static text.</li>\n<li>Depth and texture in UI are good things. Our displays have never been better suited to displaying color and fine detail, but our UI themes today look like they were designed for output on a crummy old laser printer or something.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/06/rogue-amoeba-historic-screenshot-archive\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d4e5687ede34cf2d26ce9479bf12d22965f44667e25f5d19ba1850b8c8b68d10","category":"Tech"}
