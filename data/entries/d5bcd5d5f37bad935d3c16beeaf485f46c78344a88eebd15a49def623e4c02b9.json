{"title":"Apple Intelligence Will Come to More Languages, Including German and Italian, Next Year (But Don’t Hold Your Breath for iPhones and iPads)","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24247839/apple-intelligence-language-support-german-italian","date":1726682340000,"content":"\n<p>Allison Johnson, The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Intelligence’s list of forthcoming supported languages just\ngot a little longer. After an October launch in US English, Apple\nsays its AI feature set will be available in German, Italian,\nKorean, Portuguese, Vietnamese, “and others” in the coming year.\nThe company drops this news just days before the iPhone 16’s\narrival — the phone built for AI that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241043/apple-iphone-16-pro-intelligence-ai-missing\">won’t have any AI features\nat launch</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s AI feature set will expand to include localized English in\nthe UK, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand in\nDecember, with India and Singapore joining the mix next year. The\ncompany <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/09/apple-intelligence-comes-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-starting-next-month/\">already announced plans</a> to support Chinese, French,\nJapanese, and Spanish next year as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple shared this news with me last night too, and my first thought was, “German and Italian? Does that mean they’ve gotten the OK that Apple Intelligence is, in fact, compliant with the DMA?” But that’s not what they’re announcing. This is just for Apple Intelligence <em>on the Mac</em> — which already offers Apple Intelligence in the EU in MacOS 15.1 Sequoia betas, because the Mac is not a designated “gatekeeping” platform. The standoff over Apple Intelligence on iOS and iPadOS remains.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/18/apple-intelligence-german-italian\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d5bcd5d5f37bad935d3c16beeaf485f46c78344a88eebd15a49def623e4c02b9","category":"Tech"}
