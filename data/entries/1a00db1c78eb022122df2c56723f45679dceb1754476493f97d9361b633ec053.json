The change, which is expected to be released in April, would be the first to loosen the guidance since the end of 2021.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003150#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003150&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1a00db1c78eb022122df2c56723f45679dceb1754476493f97d9361b633ec053","category":"Tech"}
