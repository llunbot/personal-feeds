This can be done by tapping and holding a feed, selecting \"Edit feeds,\" and then toggling on the switch next to \"Public feed.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnce that's done, you can share the custom feed in the following way: Tap and hold the feed you've created at the top of the Threads app, then tap \"Edit feeds.\" Next, tap \"View feed,\" and then either use the quote icon to post a preview of the feed, or use the \"Share feed\" button to send the feed as a link or direct message.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/01_Creating-Shared-Feed_Caoursel-2.jpg.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1672\" />\r<br />\nThreads first rolled out custom feeds in November. Note that the ability to share custom feeds is still in the process of rolling out, so you may not see it immediately, depending on your location. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/threads/\">Threads</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/05/threads-now-lets-you-share-custom-feeds-heres-how/\">Threads Now Lets You Share Custom Feeds – Here's How</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/threads-now-lets-you-share-custom-feeds-–-heres-how.2448818/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b987f4ceee130e3f60e47fbe1cb53afec59868d4cf8f1b8901ea9a9bedf13ce2","category":"Apple"}
