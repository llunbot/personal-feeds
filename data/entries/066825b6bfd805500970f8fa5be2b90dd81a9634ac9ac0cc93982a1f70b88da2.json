The update will \"fundamentally change\" the look of Apple's operating system, introducing a more consistent cross-platform experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Generic-iOS-19-Feature-Mock-Light.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple plans to update the style of icons, menus, apps, windows, and system buttons, and the company will simplify the way that users navigate and control their devices. The changes \"go well beyond a new design language and aesthetic tweaks.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile specific details are scarce, it's supposedly the biggest update to iOS since iOS 7, and the biggest update to macOS since Big Sur.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are design elements taken from visionOS, but the update is only \"loosely based\" on the Vision Pro interface. visionOS features round app icons with a lot of translucency, plus a simple navigation system and more use of 3D elements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is Apple's hope that a revamped interface will renew interest in its latest iPhones, iPads, and Macs and distract from the delayed rollout of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe'll get our first look at the new design in ‌iOS 19‌, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16 at the 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference, which will take place sometime in June. After that, the updates will be tested for several months before seeing a public launch in the fall.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/\">iOS 19 Will Bring Biggest Design Overhaul Since iOS 7</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-19-will-bring-biggest-design-overhaul-since-ios-7.2452730/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"066825b6bfd805500970f8fa5be2b90dd81a9634ac9ac0cc93982a1f70b88da2","category":"Apple"}
