{"title":"Sadly for China, rare Earth elements aren’t actually all that rare","link":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/sadly-for-china-rare-earth-elements-arent-actually-all-that-rare/","date":1745503318000,"content":"<p>As <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/china-tariffs-response-trump-retaliation/\">the trade war</a> between China and the United States continues to escalate, Beijing is responding by turning to one of its favorite retaliation tactics: limiting the export of critical minerals used in many <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/2-obscure-clean-energy-metals-are-caught-in-the-crosshairs-of-the-us-china-trade-war/\">high-tech electronics</a>, from fighter jets to wind turbines. While China’s mineral restrictions may sound scary, the reality is that they haven’t been very effective in the past and stand to become even less so if the US and other countries finally get their acts together.</p>\n<p>It all started in July 2023, when the Chinese government announced it would restrict the export of gallium and germanium, two critical minerals that are mostly used in making <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tandem-solar-panel-cells-efficiency-energy/\">solar panels</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-makes-the-majority-of-the-worlds-computer-chips-now-its-running-out-of-electricity/\">semiconductors</a>. Over the following two years, China’s list of controlled products expanded to include antimony, graphite, and other materials. Earlier this month, the Chinese government escalated things even further, subjecting seven rare earth elements to a more comprehensive export licensing program that covers the whole world and is designed to further choke off American companies.</p>\n<p>Rare earths are a subset of elements under the broader umbrella of critical minerals that China has long enjoyed monopoly control over. In the short term, companies that need these rare earths might be able to rely on existing stockpiles or even turn to recycled electronics to find them. But eventually, the US and other countries will be forced to either ramp up domestic mining or reduce their dependence on rare earths, both of which would make China’s policies sting less. “China has got one shot, and it knows it,” says Ian Lange, an associate professor of economics and business at the Colorado School of Mines.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/sadly-for-china-rare-earth-elements-arent-actually-all-that-rare/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/sadly-for-china-rare-earth-elements-arent-actually-all-that-rare/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Zeyi Yang, wired.com","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2fc2b2d9cc40c05c53694d593065a4e0d15042045a1fb45c2d685e4b55c0dd3b","category":"Tech"}
