Covert</a> mountain bike glove is a lightweight full-finger model that is simply one of the best gloves we’ve used in recent years. With a thin, mesh back and synthetic suede palm, these gloves are geared towards riding in warm to hot conditions with a great, “barely there” bar feel. </p><p></p><p>The Covert gloves are lightweight, but they are a bit thicker than something super-lightweight like the 100% Sling. Still, the light mesh back is great on warm days, allowing for excellent airflow and drying quickly when you sweat. The synthetic suede palm makes just a thin layer between you and the bars, keeping sweaty hands from slipping, providing an excellent bar feel, and a little protection should your hands end up in the dirt. The palm material wraps up around the outside edge of the hand and around the thumb and pointer finger where you grip the bars for added abrasion resistance. </p><p></p><p>The Covert gloves do not offer much in the way of knuckle protection except for a thin PU layer on the outer two knuckles to fend off minor encounters with trailside bushes. The pointer finger and thumb both feature silicone strips for grip on brake levers and shifters as well as conduction threads that work relatively with touchscreens. The thumb has a large, soft nose/sweat wipe, and the stretch wrist cuff has a reinforced pull tab and a clean-cut edge that is comfortable and looks good too. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps the most impressive thing about the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fdakine-covert-glove-mens\">Dakine Covert</a> gloves is their quality craftsmanship and durability. One of our testers has been riding in the same pair for two full seasons and they are still going strong with no rips or frayed stitching at all. Add to that the impressive comfort, grip, and bar feel, and you can’t go wrong with these gloves.

These gloves have been a mainstay in Giro’s line of mountain bike gloves for over a decade, and they still work just as well as they always have. They also happen to be very reasonably priced, making them an easy choice for the rider on a budget who doesn’t need or want knuckle protection. </p><p></p><p>The Giro DND is a relatively simple glove that falls toward the lighter-weight end of the spectrum. The 4-way stretch breathable mesh back of the hand is a tad thicker than the Dakine Covert described above but is plenty breathable for warm to hot conditions. The relatively thin AX Suede palm has a few perforations for ventilation and it features Giro’s <em>Super Fit</em> design and paneling that avoids excessive material or bunching when you grip the bars. The outside heel of the palm also features thin, 2mm EVA pads for a touch of crash protection. </p><p></p><p>The pointer finger and thumb have conduction threads that work reasonably well with touchscreens and the thumb, pointer, and middle fingers have silicone strips added for grip on brake and shift levers. A soft microfiber wipe on the thumb has your nose and sweat wiping needs covered. </p><p></p><p>With an excellent, comfortable fit versatility, and reasonable price, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgiro-dnd-glove\">Giro DND</a> is a no-brainer.

These gloves fall into the ultra-lightweight category and are about as close as you can come to riding without gloves while still wearing them. As ironic as that might sound, these are ideal for riding in hot weather or for the rider who wants maximum bar feel and needs a super thin layer between hand and grip to keep sweaty palms from slipping. </p><p></p><p>With a knit mesh palm and heavily perforated stretch back, this super thin and lightweight model is by far the most breathable and airy option we tested. On hot days, the airflow freely about the hand, and sweat dries exceptionally quickly if it does build up. Unlike other gloves, the Sling has a continuous, seamless mesh palm that provides excellent tactility, dexterity, and a very natural bar feel. The grip on the bar is excellent, although the lack of any silicone on the thumb and pointer finger can feel a tad slippery on untextured levers. That said, the Sling works better than any other model we tested with touchscreens, so you can leave the gloves on, even when texting.</p><p></p><p>Being incredibly light and stretchy makes the sling one of the most comfortable gloves we tested as well. In the right size, they have a nice snug fit on the hand and virtually disappear while riding. The only real drawbacks to the Sling are that they provide almost zero hand protection and that the light, thin materials seem more susceptible to damage if you are prone to crashing or brushing tree trunks while you ride. </p><p></p><p>Regardless, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F100-sling-glove\">100% Sling</a> is an amazing option for riding in hot climates or for any rider who wants their gloves to feel like they aren’t even there. With excellent breathability, comfort, and dexterity for $39.50, the Sling is as close as you can get to riding gloveless. The Sling comes in black, grey, and navy and sizes S – XXL. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F100-sling-glove\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WWKC4YX/?tag=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-2.49.05-PM-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-2.49.05-PM-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"100 Sling mountain bike gloves holding a mountain bike grip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-2.49.05-PM-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-2.49.05-PM-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-2.49.05-PM-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-2.49.05-PM-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-2.49.05-PM-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-2.49.05-PM-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-2.49.05-PM-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-2.49.05-PM-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The 100% Sling feel as close to wearing nothing at all as you can get.

With a killer fit, light protection on the outer knuckles and heel of the palm, and tough midweight fabric, the Cross-X checks all the boxes for a do-it-all mountain bike glove for any type of riding. </p><p></p><p>The Cross-X is made from a slightly thicker material than the true lightweight options and has a tough feel but still manages to breathe quite well. It has plenty of stretch and the gloves conform very nicely to the hand for a snug and secure fit. The synthetic palm is nicely contoured to avoid excess material and strategically reinforced in high-wear areas at the base of the articulated fingers and along the edges of the pointer finger and thumb. These gloves have a natural feeling grip and provide a solid connection no matter how rough the trail gets. </p><p></p><p>Dakine gave the Cross-X a light amount of protection on the outer three knuckles/fingers in the form of neoprene with small patches of TPU on top. This helps ward off small impacts and encounters with trailside branches while a patch of <em>DK Impact</em> gel sewn into the heel of the outer palm can help during those hands-first OTB dismounts. Large silicone strips on the pointer finger and thumb add traction for brake levers and shifter paddles and conduction threads stitched into the tips of those same digits work relatively well with smartphones.

With a large Airflex Impact Gel pad covering the knuckles and outer fingers, the 4.0 Lite offers heaps of protection in an otherwise lightweight, breathable glove with a great fit and excellent bar feel. </p><p></p><p>The most obvious feature of the MTB 4.0 Lite gloves is the latticed Airflex knuckle protection. While it is noticeable on the back of the hands, it is formed to the knuckle shape and articulated for the grip position, meaning they are most comfortable when you’re holding onto the bars. This padding covers all four knuckles and extends down the outer two fingers for extra coverage on your most vulnerable digits. The latticed, open design of Airflex padding allows some air to pass through to the hands, and coupled with the lightweight back of hand fabric, allows for impressive breathability for a protective glove. </p><p></p><p>One of the other highlights of the MTB 4.0 Lite gloves is the excellent fit and bar feel. The 3D contoured palm is perfectly articulated for the grip position and is made of material that Leatt calls “NanoGrip” which provides an incredibly natural grip and bar feel. The tips of the finger and thumb also work very well with touchscreens, so you don’t need to pull these off your sweaty hands every time you pull out your phone to get more footage for your next reel. A sizeable wipe on the thumb is a nice touch, and the thin, stretch wrist cuff is quite comfy as well. The only drawback to these gloves that we found is that they can be a little difficult to pull on and take off, especially with sweaty hands.</p><p></p><p>At $75 (you can often find them on sale for less), the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fgloves%2Fleatt-mtb-40-lite-bike%23image%3D232316%2F999048%2Fleatt-mtb-4-0-lite-bike-gloves-.jpg\">Leatt MTB 4.0 Lite</a> doesn’t come cheap, but they are a very well-executed glove that manages to balance serious knuckle protection with comfort and breathability. The palm shaping is perfect, the NanoGrip material provides great grip, and they look pretty cool too. Leatt makes the MTB 4.0 Lite in 5 color options and sizes S – XL. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fgloves%2Fleatt-mtb-40-lite-bike%23image%3D232316%2F999048%2Fleatt-mtb-4-0-lite-bike-gloves-.jpg\">Check Price at Evo</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L3CHYPL/?tag=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Leatt-MTB-4.0-Lite-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Leatt-MTB-4.0-Lite-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A close look at the knuckle protection on the Leatt MTB 4.0 Lite mountain bike gloves\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Leatt-MTB-4.0-Lite-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Leatt-MTB-4.0-Lite-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Leatt-MTB-4.0-Lite-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Leatt-MTB-4.0-Lite-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Leatt-MTB-4.0-Lite-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Leatt-MTB-4.0-Lite-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Leatt-MTB-4.0-Lite-1-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Leatt-MTB-4.0-Lite-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>With lots of Airflex knuckle and finger padding and a light back of hand material, the Leatt MTB 4.0 Lite gloves successfully balance protection and breathability.

By completely blocking wind and insulating better than standard warm weather gloves, this model keeps your hands toasty in temperatures from 50° F down to around 35° F while maintaining excellent dexterity for a cool weather glove. </p><p></p><p>Though they look like any old pair of mountain bike gloves, the C5 Infinium has a slightly thicker, softshell-esque back of hand that includes the Gore-Tex Infinium windproof membrane. In addition to being completely impervious to wind, Infinium is also highly water resistant, not waterproof, mind you, and it repels water from light rains or puddle splashes very effectively. At the same time, it manages to breathe impressively well, meaning your hands don’t get too sweaty, even if the temperatures warm up in the middle of your ride. This balance of attributes is hard to come by, but Gorewear nailed it with these gloves. </p><p></p><p>One thing that sets the C5 Infinium gloves apart from other cool weather options is the lack of bulk and streamlined fit. While they are a little thicker than regular gloves, they stretch nicely around the hand for a precise fit that allows for excellent dexterity. The synthetic palm material provides a good bar feel and silicone strips at the base of the fingers enhance the grip. The C5 also works with touchscreens, although fine movements like typing out a text are much easier with the gloves off. The wrist cuff is low-profile and closed with a very grippy, small velcro tab that makes getting in and out of the gloves quite easy, although peeling the velcro open can be a little tricky with gloves on.</p><p></p><p>If you don’t want to compromise dexterity to keep your hands warm during cool fall, winter, and spring rides, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgorewear-c5-gore-windstopper-glove-mens%3Fskid%3DGWR008H-BLAYL-S\">Gorewear C5 Gore-Tex Infinium</a> is our top recommendation.

These affordable, lightly insulated mountain bike gloves have a relatively slim fit, good dexterity and tactility, an extended cuff, and great grip. There are better options for wet conditions, like the Ranger Water, for example, but the Ranger Fire is a great choice for those dry, cold days in the 20° – 40° F range.</p><p></p><p>Making gloves warm without being bulky is a challenge, but something Fox has done well with the Ranger Fire. With a brushed fleece interior and a relatively thin <em>AX Suede</em> palm, these gloves feel cozy and warm yet retain a slim profile and a snug fit that feels similar to regular warm-weather models. This allows for excellent dexterity and the palms have a natural feeling grip that is enhanced by large silicone patches on the thumb and pointer/middle fingers for traction on the levers. Despite feeling quite warm on the hands, the Ranger Fire breathe well and seem to manage heat and moisture buildup quite well. Additionally, the slim extended cuff fits nicely under the wrist cuff of jackets with plenty of overlap to help cold air from chilling your wrists. The one caveat is that these cuffs can interfere with watches if you wear one. </p><p></p><p>Despite the snug fit and extended cuff, getting the Ranger Fire on and off the hands is relatively easy with lots of stretch and a nice, big pull tab on the wrist. Fox included conduction threads on the tip of the pointer finger and thumb that work okay for simple tasks on your touchscreen, although fine movements like typing are best done with the gloves off. and a large wipe on the thumb comes in handy for those chilly rides when your nose is inevitably running. Fox also calls these gloves water-resistant, and, while they repel very light amounts of moisture reasonably well, they are more prone to soaking with water in steady rains than the other cool-cold weather options we tested. </p><p></p><p>At $45, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F160146%2Ffox-ranger-fire-bike-gloves-mens%3Fcolor%3DGREEN\">Fox Ranger Fire</a> gloves are reasonably priced, and given their warmth, breathability, great fit, and dexterity, they are a great choice for riders on a budget, or any rider for that matter, seeking to keep their hands warm on those brisk fall, winter, and spring rides.

Combined with a synthetic leather palm and lots of silicone grip on the palm and fingers, these gloves are grippy, protective, and comfortable too. </p><p></p><p>Brands use lots of different materials for knuckle protection, and D30 is among the most popular. This <em>non-Newtonian</em> material is soft and flexible until a load is applied when it becomes stiffer upon impact. While many gloves feature D30 in their protective gloves, Endura has chosen to use it in a slightly different way with a thinner layer across the knuckles that extends up the outer metacarpal. This thinner layer moves more naturally and easily, making it more comfortable on the knuckles while still providing a good amount of protection. Additionally, the tough, midweight ripstop material is durable and capable of withstanding some serious abuse. </p><p></p><p>The synthetic leather palm has no padding for a direct connection to the bars and the generous amount of silicone on the palm and fingers gives these gloves a very tacky grip on both the bars and your brake and shift levers. The velcro wrist closure makes betting these gloves on and off a breeze and the wrist cuff extends slightly up the wrist compared to most similar gloves we tested. And, while we could get these gloves to unlock our phones, using them with touchscreens proved difficult given all the silicone texture on the fingers and thumb. We also noted that our test pair was slightly larger in the palm than other models in the same size, giving them a less precise fit in that area, though that may not be an issue for all riders.  </p><p></p><p>Still, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-mt500-d3o-glove-mens\">Endura MT500 D30</a> is a great pair of protective gloves that provide excellent grip on the bars and a high level of comfort through well-executed D30 knuckle padding. At $50 (or less if you find them on sale), we feel they are a good value for riders seeking comfortable hand protection in a durably constructed glove. Endura offers the MT500 D30 in numerous solid colors in sizes XS – XXL.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-mt500-d3o-glove-mens\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YP1NT75/?tag=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tRunner-Up Best Lightweight Mountain Bike Gloves\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=22233&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gorewear.com%2Fus%2Fen-us%2Ftrailkpr-gloves-100917\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGorewear TrailKPR\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$40</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>28 grams (size S)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightweight minimalist</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Knuckle Protection</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Touchscreen Compatibly</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-TrailKPR.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"705\" height=\"470\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-TrailKPR.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Gloves of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-TrailKPR.jpeg 705w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-TrailKPR-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-TrailKPR-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightweight and thin</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Precision fit</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Good fingertip execution</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Comfortable cuff</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Dry very quickly</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Difficult to get on</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not super breathable, they’re thin but they get sweaty</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=22233&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gorewear.com%2Fus%2Fen-us%2Ftrailkpr-gloves-100917\">Gorewear TrailKPR</a> is a thin, lightweight glove with a nice, articulated, precision fit, comfortable cuff, and high tactility. With a microfiber palm, very thin continuous Cordura backing, and a silicone grip patch on the brake fingers, the TrailKPR packs all the standard features into a svelte 28-gram package. If you’re seeking a light, minimalist glove for warm to hot conditions, these are a great option to consider.</p><p></p><p>Built with a seamless synthetic palm and a lightweight Cordura back-of-hand material, the TrailKPR gloves have a great, precision fit. This translates well to the bars where the palm provides a very direct and confident grip and connected feel. Unlike other lightweight gloves, the Cordura material on the back of the hands isn’t quite as well-ventilated, but it has a tougher, more abrasion and tear-resistant feel. They do get a bit sweatier on really hot days, but the material dries super quickly so it isn’t really an issue. </p><p></p><p>We found the overall fit to be excellent with well-executed fingertips that avoid bunching or irritation from seams. The stretch wrist cuff is thin and comfortable and these gloves are relatively easy to put on and take off. A small silicone patch on the pointer finger adds grip for the brake lever, and touchscreen-compatible fabric at the tips of the pointer finger and thumb work well with touchscreen devices. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=22233&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gorewear.com%2Fus%2Fen-us%2Ftrailkpr-gloves-100917\">Gorewear TrailKPR</a> is a well-built minimalist glove with a lightweight feel and tight, precise fit. For riders looking for a very tactile glove and thin, durable materials, this is a very comfortable and adaptable choice that will break the wind on cooler mornings, dry quickly after a brief rain, and stay relatively cool in all conditions. The TrailKPR gloves retail for $40 and come in three color options and a huge size range between XS – XXXL.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=22233&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gorewear.com%2Fus%2Fen-us%2Ftrailkpr-gloves-100917\">Check Price at Gorewear</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SSU2OQ/?tag=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tRunner-Up Best Midweight Mountain Bike Gloves\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-singletrack-glove-mens\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEndura Singletrack Glove\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$45</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>60 grams (size S)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Midweight glove with knuckle protection</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Knuckle Protection</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>TPU on 3 outer knuckles</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Touchscreen Compatibility</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Singletrack-Glove.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"2049\" height=\"1366\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Singletrack-Glove.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Gloves of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Singletrack-Glove.jpeg 2049w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Singletrack-Glove-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Singletrack-Glove-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Singletrack-Glove-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Singletrack-Glove-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Singletrack-Glove-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Singletrack-Glove-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Comfortable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy to put on and take off</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Small amount of TPU protection moves freely and is great for overgrown trails</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Great grip from silicone on palm and brake fingers</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Run slightly large</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Don’t work well with touchscreens</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>When most people think of mountain bike gloves, something like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-singletrack-glove-mens\">Endura Singletrack</a> is probably what comes to mind. These midweight gloves are made from a little beefier material than the lightweight options with the addition of a light amount of TPU knuckle protection, ample silicone grip on the fingertips and palm, and a velcro wrist closure. </p><p></p><p>The Singletrack gloves are made from a midweight open-weave knitted fabric that feels tough and slightly warmer than truly lightweight gloves, yet it still breathes quite well and is comfortable in warm temperatures. Thin strips of TPU have been added to the outer three knuckles to add a bit of hand protection (and protection for the gloves) from brushes with trailside bushes or tree bark. The continuous microfiber palm manages sweat well and provides a good bar feel with excellent grip thanks to a silicone Endura logo on the center of the palm. Both the pointer and middle fingers have silicone strips for brake lever grip as well and there is a terry cloth thumb wipe for your nose and/or sweat. </p><p></p><p>The wrist is closed with a small, unobtrusive velcro tab that works well and makes getting in and out of these gloves quick and easy. This is good considering the Singletrack gloves do not have conduction threads on the pointer finger or thumb. They work occasionally if your fingers are warm enough, but you’ll be taking your gloves off to respond to texts or take photos with these gloves.

With a wind-resistant 3-layer softshell back, these gloves work great to keep your hands warm on rides in the 40s and 50s F, or even cooler if it’s dry and you’re generating some body heat. </p><p></p><p>The softshell material has a light fleece lining that feels super comfortable on the hands. Combined with the wind-blocking ability of the fabric, these gloves effectively take the chill out of the wind while keeping you warm in temperatures close to, and even down to, the freezing mark. In warmer temps, around 60° F, these can feel a bit clammy, but they breathe and wick sweat well enough to avoid discomfort if it gets warmer than expected on your ride.  </p><p></p><p>Our test pair fit perfectly true to size and the velcro cuff makes sliding them on and off quick and easy, even with sweaty hands. The cuff is slightly extended and low-profile, and it slides nicely below the wrist cuffs of your favorite mountain bike jacket. The AX Suede palm avoids extra bulk, providing a natural feeling grip and connection to the bars. Silicone dots on the finger and thumb help add extra grip and traction on the levers. Conductive material on the pointer finger and thumb works okay with touchscreens, but given the comparatively bulkier fingertips, typing can still be a challenge. A very thin layer of PU covers the knuckles to prevent damage to the softshell fabric, and a soft fleecy wipe on the thumb helps handle your runny nose.</p><p></p><p>Our test pair of Trail Thermal gloves have seen two seasons of moderate use, and they look no worse for the wear. And, at $40, these gloves are an affordable option that will keep you riding comfortably on those chilly rides without breaking the bank.

With an insulated softshell back, Clarion palm, brake finger and palm silicone lettering that reads “How much effort do you give”, and a low profile neoprene cuff with velcro closure, the Brisker gloves are one of the warmest we tested, keeping our hands adequately toasty in temperatures below the freezing mark.</p><p></p><p>By comparison, the insulated softshell back of the Brisker gloves keeps the hands warmer than the Gorewear C5, Specialized Trail Thermal, and Fox Ranger Fire gloves. They work best in temperatures between 20° and 40° F, and above that they simply feel like overkill. They block wind very effectively and even handle moderate amounts of moisture fairly well too. For truly wet weather, 100% makes the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2F100-hydromatic-waterproof-gloves-black-s-10011-001-10%2Fp862026%3Fv%3D739740\">Hydromatic</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079WF2SN5/?tag=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves-20\">Hydromatic Brisker</a> models that are both more water-resistant. </p><p></p><p>The low-profile velcro cuff plays nicely with jackets and watches while making it fairly easy to get these gloves on and off. On the bars, the silicone print on the palms provides a good grip, but the palm itself isn’t well articulated and has a bit of excess material that we found to bunch and crease a bit on the grips. Not a huge issue for cold weather riding, but notable nonetheless.

Much like the Giro DND, these gloves ain’t broke, so Fox hasn’t fixed them, except for some subtle aesthetic changes from year to year. At $30, the Fox Ranger packs everything you could want in a basic riding glove into a well-executed, sensible package. </p><p></p><p>Falling at the lighter-weight end of the spectrum, the Ranger gloves are great for warm to hot conditions assuming you don’t want or need knuckle protection. The back-of-hand material is a tad thicker than the truly lightweight options, but it’s far from hot and it feels slightly more durable to stand up to scrapes and encounters with trailside bushes. The microfiber suede palm is thin and articulated to fit well and avoid bunching on the bars, and it provides a nice, connected feel and good grip. Numerous small silicone stripes on the thumb and pointer/middle fingers provide reliable traction on brake and shift levers, and the conduction threads on the tips of the pointer finger and thumb work very well with touchscreens.</p><p></p><p>Having been around for a decade or so, the fit of the Ranger gloves is spot on. The wrist cuff is short and low profile, and the velcro tab makes it super easy to get your hands in and out. The behind-the-thumb placement of the closure also avoids getting in the way of watches or snagging on jackets and long-sleeve tops.  </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffox-racing-ranger-glove-mens%3Fskid%3DFXRZ4TE-BURORAEME-M\">Fox Ranger</a> has everything a basic mountain biking glove needs and nothing it does not. At $30, it’s a great value and an easy choice for most riders looking for a good pair of gloves for riding in warm conditions.

Izumi Pulaski</a> is built to be a trail work glove that also performs well on the bike so you can dig, ride, and repeat. With a generously ventilated, recycled Ax Suede Laredo palm and durable rip-stop back, we found the Pulaski extremely comfortable on the tools and the bars, but the roomy fit couldn’t quite compare to tighter fitting gloves on the bike. That said, we loved the Pulaski for digging, doing yard work, and even as a winter driving glove.</p><p></p><p>While these are work gloves first and foremost, they proved to feel better on the bike than a cheap pair of Kincos from the hardware store, making riding to and from trail work feel a bit more natural and controlled. The slightly roomier fit takes some getting used to, but the out-seamed fingertips worked well with brake levers, shifter paddles, and tool handles. They also grip quite well whether you’re swinging tools or riding the bike. That said, fine motor skills and touchscreens can feel a little clunky, as is to be expected. </p><p></p><p>The overall fit is quite similar to your average work glove, but the out-stitched fingers keep the seems from rubbing uncomfortably or causing irritation. Generous perforations on the palm and finger along with the ripstop back allow these gloves to breathe much better than most dedicated work gloves. A small pull tab on the back of the wrist allows you to cinch them down and helps keep them in place both while working and riding.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=20053&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pearlizumi.com%2Fproducts%2Fpulaski-gloves-14342301%3Fvariant%3D42471262912683\">Pearl Izumi Pulaski</a> wouldn’t be our first choice just for riding, but when trail work and riding collide, as they often do, these are a great option that performs better on the bike than your average pair of hardware store gloves. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=20053&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pearlizumi.com%2Fproducts%2Fpulaski-gloves-14342301%3Fvariant%3D42471262912683\">Check Price at Pearl Izumi</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Frace-face-trigger-gloves-black-m-rfgb016003%2Fp1405694%3Fv%3D1350095\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRace Face Trigger Glove\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$30</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>45 grams</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightweight trail glove</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Knuckle Protection</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Touchscreen Compatibility</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Yes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Race-Face-Trigger-Glove.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"745\" height=\"497\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Race-Face-Trigger-Glove.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Gloves of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Race-Face-Trigger-Glove.jpeg 745w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Race-Face-Trigger-Glove-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Race-Face-Trigger-Glove-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Race-Face-Trigger-Glove-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightweight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Affordable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Breathes well</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Large wipe on thumb</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Less precise fit in the palm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Frace-face-trigger-gloves-black-m-rfgb016003%2Fp1405694%3Fv%3D1350095\">Raceface Trigger</a> is a warm-weather glove, with a simple one-piece, perforated Amara palm and one-piece ribbed Lycra back. With sticky silicone to provide good brake lever grip and a no-fuss cuff, the Trigger is a basic, lightweight, and affordable option that should keep most riders’ hands comfy through hot summer rides.</p><p></p><p>We found the Trigger quite comfortable in hot to moderate temperatures with high airflow through the ribbed Lycra back and perforated palm. The stretchy patch of material at the base of the thumb helped us get sweaty or wet hands in and out of the gloves with no trouble, and the Amara palm and silicone patch on the pointer finger gave a reliable grip on the bars and brake levers. Overall, the fit is comfortable, though we found the palm to be a touch loose compared to similar options, resulting in a light amount of bunching. It’s quite easy to get used to, though it is somewhat noticeable in use.</p><p></p><p>The thumb holds most of the features of the Trigger gloves. A large terry cloth panel covers the entire thumb for wiping sweat and runny noses and conduction threads on the tip of the thumb work well on touchscreens. It would be nice if the finger also featured these threads, but the thumb works well enough for simple tasks. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Frace-face-trigger-gloves-black-m-rfgb016003%2Fp1405694%3Fv%3D1350095\">Race Face Trigger</a> is a simple, no-frills glove that is quite similar to the Giro DND or Fox Ranger. They work well for warm to hot temperatures for the rider seeking full hand coverage without knuckle protection at the palatable price of $30.

With a durable stretch backing, <em>TruFeel</em> Clarino palm, well-placed velcro wrist closure, and ribbed D30 knuckle padding, they do just that, although we feel this style of knuckle protection leaves a little to be desired comfort-wise. </p><p></p><p>The Clarino palm with <em>TruFeel</em> internal silicone texture provides a reliable grip without being too sticky or tacky, much like the microfiber suede palm on the Fox Ranger. The shaping and articulation of the palm are great with little to no creasing, providing a very natural and predictable feel while riding. Lots of thin silicone strips on the fingers and thumb provide additional grip on the bars and great traction on the shift and brake levers. The Cordura back of the gloves has great stretch, admirable breathability, and it feels tough and durable to stand up to the abuse of heavy-hitting riding. The well-designed velcro wrist closure makes glove on-offs a snap, and these gloves work quite well with touchscreens for mid-ride bike selfies.</p><p></p><p>The ribbed D30 knuckle protection provides solid protection across all four knuckles. There is a bit of internal forming of this pad for the knuckles to settle into, but given the stiffness of the material, it isn’t the most comfortable when the hands are gripping the bars. It feels marginally better when the gloves really warm up, but you can always feel the padding atop the knuckles. To be fair this is an issue we’ve experienced with all gloves that have this style of padding, which is quite a few, as it simply doesn’t feel as comfortable as the flat-backed pads used on models like the Endura MT500 D30 or the Leatt MTB 4.0 Lite, for example.

With a waterproof outer layer and insulation inside, the Conspiracy can handle below-freezing temperatures while keeping your hands protected from outside moisture. These gloves are bulky and they have a relatively limited temperature range, but they’ll keep you warm in the right conditions, and for a pretty reasonable price too. </p><p></p><p>With a waterproof backing and thermal liner, the Conspiracy gloves are made for riding in cold temperatures. They block wind well and are very water resistant, making them a great option for cold and sloppy days. The low-profile wrist cuff has a velcro closure that helps to further seal out the elements. The one drawback we found with these gloves is that it’s easy to overheat in them if you’re working hard or exceed their temperature bandwidth, approximately 20° to 40° F, and the liner makes it kinda difficult to get them on and off once your hands are sweaty.</p><p></p><p>Warmth aside, the Conspiracy gloves have a surprisingly great bar feel and grip thanks to the synthetic leather palm, and the silicone strips on the index and middle finger give tacky brake finger traction. Still, they are bulky and that impacts dexterity quite a bit. That said, the reduction in tactility and dexterity is expected and isn’t that disappointing when wearing these gloves in the right conditions. Conduction threads are stitched into the tip of the thumb, but given the bulk of these gloves, it doesn’t work all that well. </p><p></p><p>If you’re riding in below-freezing temperatures, possibly combined with wet weather, the <a href=\"https://www.raceface.com/products/conspiracy-gloves?variant=32058418659410\">Race Face Conspiracy</a> gloves will help keep you warm and dry. They aren’t the most versatile, but for the right conditions they are a great option to have in the glove quiver, and at $49, they’re quite reasonably priced too.

Bikerumor collectively has well over a century of riding experience, and we’ve spent most of that time riding with mountain bike gloves. Sure there are some days we’ve forgotten the gloves at home or chosen to ride without them, but we almost always wear gloves when we’re riding. And, we’ve learned that the right pair of gloves can play a major role in our comfort, add protection, and help us maintain a good grip on the bars for maximum control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this buyer’s guide, we rounded up 17 different mountain bike glove models with a diverse selection of styles, materials, protection levels, and insulating properties. Two testers, Jeremy Benson and Paul Clauss put these gloves through their paces and collaborated to create this review. Jeremy has been mountain biking for over 30 years and has been testing mountain bikes and accessories professionally for over six years. He lives near Lake Tahoe, CA, where he rides in the full spectrum of temperature and weather conditions, and knows the importance of having the right gloves to match. He has personally tested more than 30 pairs of gloves and enjoys putting products through the wringer while scrutinizing their design and performance. In addition to gloves, Jeremy has tested <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-helmet/\">half-shell mountain bike helmets</a>, mountain bike shorts, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/\">clipless mountain bike shoes</a> for comprehensive reviews. Paul lives on the other side of the country in northern Vermont where the temperature varies as wildly as the weather and the trail conditions are ever-changing. Paul has been hard at work testing a variety of products for our buyer’s guides this year, and his love of riding and mechanical engineering background make him great at analyzing products and finding their strengths and weaknesses. Along with gloves, Paul has tested and reviewed the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/\">best mountain bike flat pedals</a>, flat pedal shoes to go along with them, dropper posts, bike pumps, and apparel like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-jackets/\">mountain bike jackets</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How We Tested Mountain Bike Gloves</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After looking over nearly every model on the market, we gathered a diverse selection of 16 models to test and compare. Each pair was weighed before taking a close look at the design, materials, construction, and stitching. At home, we put each model on to examine the out-of-the-box fit and comfort as well as the ease of getting the gloves on and off in a controlled environment. Most importantly, we took each model to the trails and rode in them for weeks, and some models for multiple seasons, to test their grip, bar feel, dexterity, breathability, and comfort when used in the real world. For the protective models, we took note of padding placement and the level of protection, as well as the comfort of the pads in use. For the cool weather models, we tested them on crisp early morning rides, cool to cold fall days, and some light rain showers to determine how well they kept our hands warm, their ideal temperature ranges, and how well they work while riding. We also tested features like touchscreen compatibility, silicone grippers, velcro cuffs, and nose wipes to see how functional and useful they actually are. After extensive testing, we zeroed in our our favorites and those that stand out in specific ways compared to the rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Testing-MTB-Gloves.jpeg\"><img width=\"1306\" height=\"870\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Testing-MTB-Gloves.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Clauss testing mountain bike gloves\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Testing-MTB-Gloves.jpeg 1306w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Testing-MTB-Gloves-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Testing-MTB-Gloves-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Testing-MTB-Gloves-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Testing-MTB-Gloves-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Testing-MTB-Gloves-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>There’s no substitute for real-world testing.

What type of riding do you do, what temperatures or weather are you riding in, and do you need or want added hand protection? Answering those questions will help you narrow down the choices, but you’ll also want to ensure that you get a good fit and the features you want. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Intended Use</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The right pair of mountain bike gloves for you depends mainly on your intended use – what type of conditions you are riding in and what level of protection do you need? Given that gloves come in a wide range of styles, there are models purpose-built to suit every need including those made for hot weather, cold weather, protection, and everything in between. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-lightweight-glove-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-lightweight-glove-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The 100% Sling lightweight mountain bike gloves\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-lightweight-glove-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-lightweight-glove-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-lightweight-glove-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-lightweight-glove-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-lightweight-glove-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-lightweight-glove-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-lightweight-glove-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100-Sling-lightweight-glove-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Made from thin, stretchy materials with ventilation holes and mesh palm, the 100% sling is a super lightweight option for riding in hot temperatures. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Lightweight</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Exceptionally light and breathable gloves are great for warm to hot temperatures, and they essentially provide a thin layer of material between our sweaty hands and grips. This style of glove is often preferred by those who live and ride in hotter climates, ride in the heat of the day, ride at a high intensity, don’t need/want additional knuckle protection, or people who want gloves that barely even feel like they are there. Made with thin, stretchy materials, this style of glove is typically sleek, low profile, breathes well, and dries quickly, while providing maximum dexterity, tactility, and a natural grip and bar feel.

These thicker materials typically provide marginally more hand protection than the thinner, lighter options, and some feature very light amounts of knuckle protection in the form of TPU or small foam pads. They also tend to be just a little warmer on the hands, although they still usually breathe fairly well, so they are often a good option for those who ride in more moderate temperatures.

Protective gloves generally feature some type of padding built into the back of the glove, covering the knuckles and sometimes extending down the outer fingers or up the back of the hand. The padding used for protection varies, but D30, Airflex impact gel, foam pads, and TPU patches are commonly used in this style of gloves. While there are limits to the protection provided by these gloves, they all work well to deflect foliage on overgrown trails, absorb smaller impacts like clipping larger branches or trees, and can help to prevent minor injuries like cuts and abrasions.

(photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cool Weather</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not always warm outside, and, depending on where you live and ride, often the best riding of the season comes in the cooler months of fall, winter, and spring when the temperatures have dipped, but it isn’t super cold. Fortunately, there are a number of great mountain bike glove options designed for those conditions that are above freezing but are too cold for regular warm-weather gloves. Often, these gloves use thicker materials like softshell or similar, may include a fleecy insulation layer, and possibly a wind-blocking layer or water-resistant membrane like Gore-Tex Infinium to take the chill out of the wind. Generally speaking, these gloves tend to be only slightly bulkier than regular gloves, so they don’t limit dexterity or impact bar feel like heavier, more insulated gloves can. Cool-weather gloves are great for those days in the 40° to 50° F degree range, although some can keep you warm slightly above or below that depending on the conditions and intensity of your riding. Gloves like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgorewear-c5-gore-windstopper-glove-mens%3Fskid%3DGWR008H-BLAYL-S\">Gorewear C5 Gore-Tex Infinium</a>, Specialized Trail Thermal, and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F160146%2Ffox-ranger-fire-bike-gloves-mens%3Fcolor%3DGREEN\">Fox Ranger Fire</a> are great options for riding in cool weather.

(photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cold Weather</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For temperatures close to or below the freezing mark, a more insulated cold-weather glove is the key to keeping your hands happy while you ride. This style of glove typically includes a wind-blocking layer and/or water-resistant membrane to keep the chill off your hands, along with insulation to surround them in pillowy warmth. The addition of insulation typically results in an increase of overall bulk, and these gloves tend to sacrifice a bit of dexterity and tactility in exchange for warmth, which is a tradeoff most riders are willing to make in the right conditions. The warmest gloves we tested are the <a href=\"https://www.raceface.com/products/conspiracy-gloves?variant=32058418659410\">Race Face Conspiracy</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HRMHX1V/?tag=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves-20\">100% Brisker</a>, with the Conspiracy being the warmer of the two. For those who ride in truly frigid conditions, there are lots of other true cold-weather gloves on the market and our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-winter-cycling-gloves/\">review of winter cycling gloves</a> has some great options. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Wet Weather</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, we didn’t test any dedicated wet weather gloves this time around, but there are lots of waterproof gloves on the market for those who ride in wet conditions regularly. Brands like Gorewear, Fox, 100%, Endura, and others make gloves that can keep your hands dry in the rain. Of the models we tested, some of the cool and cold weather options are highly water-resistant, like the Gore-Wear C5 Gore-Tex Infinium. While not completely waterproof, the Infinium membrane does repel light amounts of water quite effectively. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-fit-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-fit-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Fox Ranger mountain bike gloves\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-fit-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-fit-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-fit-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-fit-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-fit-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-fit-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-fit-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-fit-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>It’s important that your gloves fit well for comfort and control. The Fox Ranger gloves have a dialed fit, assuming you get the right size. (photo Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting gloves that fit well is a very important step in the purchase process. Ideally, a well-fitting pair of mountain bike gloves will feel like a second skin that avoids being too tight or excessively loose. Gloves that are too tight may be challenging to put on or the fingers may be too short which may cause discomfort or result in a reduction of dexterity. Gloves that are too loose will have a sloppy fit that may result in material bunching or your hands moving around in the gloves resulting in a reduction of control. Gloves that fit well should have fingers that are the perfect length and a palm that matches the shape of your hand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you already know your mountain bike glove (or other gloves) size you can generally go with that, especially if you’re buying the same brand. There is some variance in sizing between brands, but they are typically in the same ballpark size-wise. If you don’t know your size, head to your local bike shop or outdoor store and try some on to find the right fit. If that’s not an option, try on some of your friend’s gloves and see what fits best, or take some measurements and reference the brand’s size charts. Most gloves are sold in <em>Alpha</em> sizes represented by letters like S, M, L, etc., and often these sizes are accompanied by the equivalent numerical glove size on size charts, such as 7, 8, 9, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wrist Cuff</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, wrist cuff designs fall into two categories, stretch or velcro closure. Gloves with stretch wrists just get pulled over the hand and the materials generally have enough stretch to allow you to put them on and take them off with relative ease. This style does not offer any adjustability, but it avoids any added bulk at the wrist, and there is no velcro that can be prone to breaking down over time. Velcro closures allow the cuff to be opened for easy entry and exit from the gloves while also providing the opportunity to adjust the tension around the wrist. What style works better for you is generally a personal preference, with most riders typically choosing one or the other or sometimes not caring at all. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Mt500-D30-palm-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Mt500-D30-palm-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Close up view of the silicone on the palm of the Endura MT500 D30 mountain bike gloves\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Mt500-D30-palm-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Mt500-D30-palm-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Mt500-D30-palm-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Mt500-D30-palm-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Mt500-D30-palm-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Mt500-D30-palm-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Mt500-D30-palm-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Mt500-D30-palm-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>If you want a super tacky grip, look for gloves with silicone added to the palms like the Endura MT500 D30. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Grip</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth considering the level of grip you want from your gloves. While many people seek the most natural bar feel, as close as possible to not wearing gloves, others may enjoy a little extra tackiness and traction. Since the majority of gloves have palms made from similar materials like microfiber or synthetic suede, they typically offer very similar levels of grip on the bars. Some brands, like Endura, for example, add silicone grip patches to the palms of their gloves, such as the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-mt500-d3o-glove-mens\">MT500 D30</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-singletrack-glove-mens\">Singletrack Glove</a>, that provide an almost sticky feel. While this may not appeal to riders who like to reposition their hands, it does give them a very positive connection to the grips. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most, but not all, gloves have some silicone texture added to the tips of the pointer finger and often the thumb and middle fingers as well. This can add to the bar grip a little, but mostly it serves to add traction on your brake levers and shifter paddles. While it isn’t completely necessary, we feel it is a nice feature to keep your fingers and/or thumbs from sliding off when braking, shifting, or lowering your dropper while you ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/d30-knuckle-protection-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/d30-knuckle-protection-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The D30 knuckle protection on the Fox Defend D30 mountain bike gloves\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/d30-knuckle-protection-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/d30-knuckle-protection-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/d30-knuckle-protection-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/d30-knuckle-protection-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/d30-knuckle-protection-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/d30-knuckle-protection-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/d30-knuckle-protection-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/d30-knuckle-protection-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Brands use different styles of padding for their protective gloves, but the ribbed D30 pad on the Fox Defend D30 is among the most common. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Knuckle Protection</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Any mountain bike glove provides more protection for the hands than not wearing any gloves at all, but downhill, enduro, and aggressive trail riders often opt for gloves with knuckle padding. Whether for added protection for crashes or fending off impacts from trailside obstacles, a little padding can help prevent cuts, abrasions, and possibly even broken knuckles. These protective features typically consist of impact-absorbing pads integrated into the construction of the gloves providing protection for the knuckles and sometimes the outer fingers and/or the outer metacarpal. The designs, materials, and levels of protection used in protective gloves vary, but many use D30 which is an impact-absorbing material that is flexible and stiffens upon impact.

Since protection needs vary, other models have just a moderate level of protection like the Endura Singletrack gloves that feature thin strips of TPU across the outer three knuckles. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/touchscreen-fingertips-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/touchscreen-fingertips-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A closeup of the touchscreen compatible conduction threads on the Fox Ranger mountain bike gloves \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/touchscreen-fingertips-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/touchscreen-fingertips-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/touchscreen-fingertips-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/touchscreen-fingertips-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/touchscreen-fingertips-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/touchscreen-fingertips-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/touchscreen-fingertips-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/touchscreen-fingertips-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Conduction threads, like these stitched into the tip of the pointer finger and thumb on the Fox Ranger gloves, are a common feature for touchscreen compatibility.

Whether for responding to a text, checking Trailforks, or grabbing sick photos of your friends riding, it’s a nice feature to have. Conduction threads are the most common, and these small threads are typically sewn into the tips of the pointer finger and thumb. Some gloves use small touchscreen-friendly panels of material, while others have palm materials so thin that work fine without any special stitching or materials.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fat-biking-with-insulated-gloves-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fat-biking-with-insulated-gloves-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding a fat bike in insulated mountain bike gloves\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fat-biking-with-insulated-gloves-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fat-biking-with-insulated-gloves-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fat-biking-with-insulated-gloves-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fat-biking-with-insulated-gloves-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fat-biking-with-insulated-gloves-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fat-biking-with-insulated-gloves-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fat-biking-with-insulated-gloves-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fat-biking-with-insulated-gloves-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Mountain biking in cold weather or fat biking in the winter demands insulated gloves.

Since temperatures vary, glove manufacturers make a wide range of cool and cold weather gloves to suit those varying conditions. The vast majority of mountain bikers don’t ride in temperatures below freezing, so thankfully there are plenty of great lightly insulated and wind-blocking gloves on the market that are well suited to cool temperatures above the freezing mark. These gloves typically avoid the bulk of more heavily insulated gloves and allow for good dexterity and a relatively “normal” fit and feel on the bike. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgorewear-c5-gore-windstopper-glove-mens%3Fskid%3DGWR008H-BLAYL-S\">Gorewear C5 Gore-Tex Infinium</a>, <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66154X1653891&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.specialized.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fmens-trail-thermal-gloves%2Fp%2F187314%3Fcolor%3D300084-187314\">Specialized Trail Thermal</a>, and the Fox Ranger Fire all fall into the cool weather category. All of these gloves will take the edge off cool temperatures where regular gloves don’t quite cut it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For truly cold conditions below freezing, wind-blocking materials are typically combined with thicker insulation to keep the hands toasty. In general, the warmer the gloves, the thicker the insulation, which results in more bulk and a reduction in dexterity. That said, when keeping your hands from freezing is the priority, that’s an easy sacrifice to make. The warmest glove we tested is the <a href=\"https://www.raceface.com/products/conspiracy-gloves?variant=32058418659410\">Race Face Conspiracy</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HRMHX1V/?tag=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves-20\">100% Brisker</a> just a bit behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the grand scheme of things, mountain gloves are one of the least expensive accessories in the sport. General-purpose riding gloves typically cost around $30 on the lower end, so picking up a new pair every season or two is a fairly easy pill to swallow. Once you start adding features like knuckle protection, windproof materials, or insulation, the price tends to go up a bit. Of the gloves we tested, we feel the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgiro-dnd-glove\">Giro DND</a> is the best value at a retail price of $26. These gloves are classic and haven’t changed in years because they simply work well and fit great. Our testers have used many pairs of them over the years, and they typically last through 1 or 2 seasons of heavy use. Moving into protective gloves, $50 is a good price for models like the Endura MT500 D30 or the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T1QMWRJ/?tag=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves-20\">Fox Defend D30</a>. Among the cool weather options, the Specialized Trail Thermal and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingmountainbikegloves&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F160146%2Ffox-ranger-fire-bike-gloves-mens%3Fcolor%3DGREEN\">Fox Ranger Fire</a> are both solid values with prices of $40 and $45, respectively. It’s also worth noting that gloves can often be found at discounted prices, and online retailers will often have last year’s colors or graphics on sale for less than full retail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Mountain Bike Gloves</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why Should I Wear Gloves While Mountain Biking?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>While some riders prefer not to wear gloves while mountain biking for the ultimate connection to their handlebars, most riders choose to wear them for a variety of reasons. First, gloves put a thin layer of material between the hands and grips that manages moisture and prevents sweaty palms from slipping while reducing friction and callous buildup. Second, gloves provide a layer of protection for the palms if/when you crash. Third, gloves provide protection for the top of the hands from sun and brushes with trailside obstacles like bushes and tree bark. Thicker materials and padded gloves provide even more protection for the knuckles and may help prevent cuts, abrasions, or worse. Sure, you can ride in any old gloves you want, but we always recommend riding in mountain bike specific gloves for the precise, articulated fit and bike specific features that make them better suited to the task.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What Type of Gloves Do I Need?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>By considering the type of riding you do and the temperatures and conditions you ride in regularly, you should be able to zero in on the type of gloves that you need. For most riders, a single pair of versatile gloves will probably do the trick for the vast majority of their riding. For others, it might make the most sense to have multiple pairs of gloves to cover them for different riding scenarios or weather conditions. Fortunately, mountain bike gloves are among the least expensive accessories, so it isn’t cost-prohibitive to have several pairs, depending on your budget, of course. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How well do these gloves actually work with touchscreens?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Most mountain bike gloves these days attempt to work with touchscreens. The methods vary, but conduction threads stitched into the thumb and fingertips are probably the most common, while others use small patches of touchscreen-friendly materials instead. While they asll mostly work with screens, the effectiveness of these features varies and often is a function of the thickness of the gloves. Nearly all gloves with built-in touchscreen features will work to wake up your screen, and some will even work to type texts and take photos. The thicker the material or bulkier the gloves, however, the less precise your fingers become on the screen. While some gloves work just as well as your bare hand, it will be a lot easier to take your hands out of others to properly use your phone.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How do I know what size gloves to get?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>If you already know what size you wear in other gloves, it’s often as simple as getting the same size for mountain bike gloves. This isn’t always the case, however, as we want our riding gloves to have a snug, slop-free fit for the best bar feel and maximum control. If you don’t know your size already, take some measurements and check the size charts on brand websites. Better yet, head to your local bike shop and try on different sizes to find your perfect fit and buy them there. They’ll be glad you stopped in.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How do I take care of mountain bike gloves?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Whether from wiping your nose or sweaty head, crashing in the dirt, riding in a dust cloud, or simply sweating in them, mountain bike gloves get really dirty. So, it’s important to wash them regularly to keep them smelling and looking fresh and keep bacteria at bay. Most gloves can be washed in a washing machine, although many people prefer to hand wash them. If using a machine, it is generally best to wash them in cold water and ensure that any velcro tabs are closed so they don’t snag on any other clothing or pick up lint in the process. Putting them through a dryer can have adverse effects on silicone grippers or knuckle padding, so we always recommend hanging them to dry. Of course, there are other methods, but we’ve never had an issue running our gloves through the washing machine for regular cleaning.  </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The best mountain bike shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Mountain Bike Shoes of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-gloves/\">The Best Mountain Bike Gloves of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ab62c004204b13348749d6da4f28ef0f5ee0882ce21f155e0da2649dce204e12","category":"Cycling"}
