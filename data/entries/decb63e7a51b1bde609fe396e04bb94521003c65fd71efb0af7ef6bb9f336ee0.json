{"title":"Sponsorship Openings at Daring Fireball, End-of-Year and Q1 2025 Edition","link":"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/","date":1734227979000,"content":"\n<p>After being sold out for months, the <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/\">upcoming sponsorship schedule</a> at DF is wide open at the moment — including the final two weeks of the year. I know sponsors are sometimes hesitant to book weeks around major holidays, but, well, Daring Fireball is never “closed”. And traffic to the site is remarkably consistent even during weeks like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Nerds get bored and want to read interesting stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Q1 2025 weeks are wide open too, but I only just now opened those weeks on the calendar.</p>\n\n<p>Weekly sponsorships have been the top source of revenue for Daring Fireball ever since I started selling them <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive\">back in 2007</a>. They’ve succeeded, I think, because they make everyone happy. They generate good money. There’s only one sponsor per week and the sponsors are always relevant to at least some sizable portion of the DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and hopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors’ perspective, they work. My favorite thing about them is how many sponsors <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive\">return for subsequent weeks</a> after seeing the results.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve got a product or service you think would be of interest to DF’s audience of people obsessed with high quality and good design, <a href=\"mailto:sponsors@daringfireball.net?subject=Feed%20Sponsorship\">get in touch</a>. And again, this coming week remains open, and the week after. I’m even offering those two weeks at a holiday discount.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/14/sponsorship-openings-at-df-end-of-year\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"decb63e7a51b1bde609fe396e04bb94521003c65fd71efb0af7ef6bb9f336ee0","category":"Tech"}
