Now Apple has announced that you can <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-launches-self-service-repair-for-ipad-expands-repair-programs/\">fix your iPad at home</a> too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Owners of the iPad Air (M2 and M3), iPad Pro (M4), iPad mini (A17 Pro), or iPad (A16) can diagnose and repair their tablet at home with official Apple parts, including displays, batteries, cameras, and the USB-C port. Users will be able to order parts and tools through Apple’s <a href=\"https://selfservicerepair.com/en-US/order\">Self Service Repair Store</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than a small number of people who want the satisfaction of the DIY repair, however, most users will still opt for a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670653/how-to-book-an-appointment-at-an-apple-stores-genius-bar.html\">Genius Bar appointment</a>. Prices aren’t available in the store yet, but they’re not likely to be cheap. For example, a display for the 14-inch M3 Pro/Max MacBook Pro, which “requires a new Lid Angle Sensor to complete repair,” costs $659.12, while a logic board is $1,847.12. Apple provides a small credit for returning the replacement part ($439.12 for the logic board, for example) and offers a $49 7-day toolkit rental. Plus, the process is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNZ_wJjIDSw\">decidedly difficult</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the iPad, Apple has also expanded the Self Service Repair Program to Canada.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6ebf14a4a26ebe4c086c1c8d3878dcdc667e28ce2c92446e6229517f6238c8d6","category":"Apple"}
