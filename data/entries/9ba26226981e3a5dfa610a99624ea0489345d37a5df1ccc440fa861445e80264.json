{"title":"There’s a funny reason why every AirTag in the world updated at the same time","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2277547/airtag-firmware-update-2-0-73-accidentally-pushed-out-to-all-users.html","date":1711141115000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, when Apple releases an AirTag update, it rolls it out in waves over several weeks to balance the load on its servers. One of those firmware updates was supposed to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2274113/airtag-getting-update-no-one-knows-what-it-does.html\">begin rolling out on Wednesday</a> with the version 2.0.73 update reaching 100 percent of users by April 9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that gradual rollout didn’t happen–instead, it went to all active AirTags in the wild at the same time. And the reason why is kind of funny. Over on X (formally Twitter) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/iswupdates?s=21&amp;t=lSxss2SVVFL6yY0vvT8EFw&amp;xcust=1-1-2277547-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">@iSWUpdates</a> spilled the beans: Apple entered the dates incorrectly in the system, causing the update to be released to all AirTags at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Looks like Apple accidentally set the deployment dates for the 2.0.73 AirTag firmware to \"m/d/24\" instead of \"m/d/2024\" that has used in previous versions and which the AirTag update system uses as date format. <br /><br />As a result, AirTags think the deployment dates are in the year 24… <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/dH5s0FrgTy&amp;xcust=1-1-2277547-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/dH5s0FrgTy</a></p>— iSoftware Updates (@iSWUpdates) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/iSWUpdates/status/1770901451159556487?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2277547-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">March 21, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the screenshots provided by @iSWUpdates, the dates for a pervious update, 2.0.61, are entered in mm/dd/yyyy format. However, the dates for the new 2.0.73 update are entered as mm/dd/yy, which meant that Apple’s system interpreted the year as 24, not 2024–and since we’re well past the year 24, Apple’s system went ahead and issued the update all at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only consequence to the user is that it’s possible that it took a bit longer than usual for an AirTag to update due to a logjam. Users can’t control when an update occurs; it usually happens when the controlling iPhone is in range. However, chances are you didn’t even notice the update installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for what’s in the update, no one really knows outside of Apple. The company has yet to update its <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/102183&amp;xcust=1-1-2277547-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirTags update support document</a> with information on version 2.0.73. If you really want to know, check back at a later time.</p>\n\nMobile Phone Accessories</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9ba26226981e3a5dfa610a99624ea0489345d37a5df1ccc440fa861445e80264","category":"Apple"}
