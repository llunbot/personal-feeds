Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/sony-hits-pause-on-psvr2-production-as-unsold-inventory-piles-up\">reports</a> that the PlayStation-maker has stopped producing new PSVR2 units as it tries to clear out a growing backlog of unsold inventory.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg cites \"people familiar with [Sony's] plans\" in reporting that PSVR2 sales have \"slowed progressively\" since its February 2023 launch. Sony has produced \"well over 2 million\" units of the headset, compared to what tracking firm IDC estimates as just 1.69 million unit shipments to retailers through the end of last year. The discrepancy has caused a \"surplus of assembled devices... throughout Sony’s supply chain,\" according to Bloomberg's sources.</p>\n<p>IDC estimates a quarterly low of 325,000 PSVR2 units shipped in the usually hot holiday season, compared to a full 1.3 million estimated holiday shipments for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-version-0-5/\">Meta's then-new Quest 3 headset</a>, which combined with other Quest products to account for over 3.7 million estimated sales for the full year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010970#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010970&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b30233772c87d6cc54e5907a53fba4b18b0d4164f36c920930a143f16014f66c","category":"Tech"}
