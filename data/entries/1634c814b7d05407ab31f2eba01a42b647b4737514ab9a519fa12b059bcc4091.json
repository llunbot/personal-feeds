The ACME siren began life as the ‘Cyclists Road Clearer’ in the 1880s.</p>\n<p>Chater-Lea is delighted to have joined forces with J Hudson &amp; Co. to create the ‘<a href=\"https://www.chaterlea.com/?mc_cid=d806bfc530&amp;mc_eid=0e63847382\" target=\"_blank\">Chater-Lea Road Clearer</a>’ for £39.00.</p>\n<p>This unique whistle combines the peerless ACME siren with a beautifully machined solid brass case designed and manufactured by Chater-Lea here in the UK. The brass case directs the sound and adds character as a unique patina develops over the years!</p>\n<p>If you love throwbacks and are looking for an interesting holiday gift for a loved one, then be sure to consider this!
