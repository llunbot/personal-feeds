That includes greater transparency and new types of windows and buttons â€” and that should make all Apple devices feel more consistent and familiar.</blockquote>iOS 19's more transparent design has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/\">already been leaked for the Camera app</a>, and the new look will likely extend to notifications and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe visionOS-like design changes have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-visionos-redesign-rumors/\">rumored by three sources so far</a>, so there is a good chance that this rumor is true.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSimilar design changes are coming to the iPad and Mac with iPadOS 19 and macOS 16, respectively, according to Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe previously said the iOS 19 design changes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/\">will be the biggest since iOS 7</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple should announce iOS 19 at WWDC 2025 in June, with the first developer beta to follow shortly after the keynote.
