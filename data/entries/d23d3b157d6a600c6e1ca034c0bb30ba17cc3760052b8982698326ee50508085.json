Here’s how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Select Payment Method</strong>: At checkout, choose “Pay with HSA/FSA funds.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Health Survey</strong>: Complete a brief health survey on the Truemed website.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Finalize Purchase</strong>: Enter your HSA/FSA card or another payment method. If using a regular credit or debit card, you can still request reimbursement through your HSA/FSA.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the health survey is submitted, a licensed medical provider reviews your responses and issues a Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) if eligible.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-MOVE-and-CLIMB.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-MOVE-and-CLIMB.jpeg\" alt=\"Wahoo KICKR MOVE and CLIMB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-MOVE-and-CLIMB.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-MOVE-and-CLIMB-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-MOVE-and-CLIMB-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-MOVE-and-CLIMB-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-MOVE-and-CLIMB-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wahoo-KICKR-MOVE-and-CLIMB-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Wahoo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Do You Save?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For US-based customers, by using HSA or FSA funds, athletes can save up to 30% on eligible purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We’re thrilled to offer this new integration, expanding access to our products for endurance athletes who want to invest in their fitness and health.
