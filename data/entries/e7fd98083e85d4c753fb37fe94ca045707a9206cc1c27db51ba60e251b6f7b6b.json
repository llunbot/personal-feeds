Klay Thompson has not yet issued a statement regarding the accusations. The incidents have left the community shaken, but no injuries were reported. The motive behind the alleged vandalism remains unclear.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Grok appears to be confusing a common basketball term, where players are said to be throwing \"bricks\" when they take an airball shot that doesn't hit the rim. <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/klay-thompson-accused-brick-vandalism-spree-ai-19407952.php\">According to SF Gate</a>, which was one of the first outlets to report the Grok error, Thompson had an \"all-time rough shooting\" night, hitting none of his shots on what was his emotional last game with the Golden State Warriors before becoming an unrestricted free agent.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018467#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018467&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e7fd98083e85d4c753fb37fe94ca045707a9206cc1c27db51ba60e251b6f7b6b","category":"Tech"}
