{"title":"Apple hasn’t forgotten about HomePod after all","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2554691/apple-hasnt-forgotten-about-homepod-after-all.html","date":1734010658000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than a new HomePod mini color that’s suspiciously similar to the color it replaced, Apple has all but ignored its smart speaker lineup this year. However, even though HomePod missed out on Apple Intelligence this year, Apple gave Siri an upgrade in the latest software update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shipping with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2544350/six-ways-apple-intelligence-levels-up-with-ios-18-2-and-macos-15-2.html\">iOS 18.2</a> yesterday, HomePod Software version 18.2 includes a new feature that will be noticeable when asking Siri to play a song from Apple Music. According to Apple’s release notes, Siri on HomePod is “now integrated with Apple Music natural language search so you can describe what you want to hear using any combination of categories like genre, mood, decade or activity.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature, which was also added to the Apple Music app’s search bar, “lets you describe what you’re looking for using any combination of categories like genres, moods, actors, decades, and more.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While not quite Apple Intelligence, the feature is definitely Apple Intelligence adjacent and will make it easier to play and discover new music. HomePod should now be able to play music with vague prompts when you don’t know the specific song you want to hear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, 2nd-gen HomePod users will get a new <em>Enhance Dialogue</em> option when paired with an Apple TV 4K to “hear speech more clearly over background sounds using real-time audio processing and machine learning.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HomePod software version 18.2 also includes the usual bug fixes and stability improvements. You can update your HomePod by going to the Home app and tapping the menu button in the top right corner, then <em>Home Settings</em>, <em>Software Update</em>, and <em>Update All</em>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8a212eae4996b9ca2115d57c31b0604d7a0080d5abf177e7312aff605982493b","category":"Apple"}
