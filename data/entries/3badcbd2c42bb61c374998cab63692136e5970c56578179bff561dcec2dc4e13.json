Users will take a short Hearing Test using the AirPods and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, and if hearing loss is detected, a personalized sound profile is created that allows the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 to make dynamic sound adjustments to increase sound as needed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says that the clinical-grade hearing aid feature will help people better engage in conversation and stay connected to the people and environment around them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPersonalized hearing profiles are automatically applied to music, movies, games, and phone calls without the need to adjust any settings. For those with little to no hearing loss, the Hearing Test will also help with specific adjustments at individual frequencies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to roll out the Hearing Aid feature for ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 this fall.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/12/airpods-pro-2-hearing-aid-fda-authorization/\">Apple Gets FDA Authorization for AirPods Pro 2 Hearing Aid Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-gets-fda-authorization-for-airpods-pro-2-hearing-aid-feature.2436023/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3badcbd2c42bb61c374998cab63692136e5970c56578179bff561dcec2dc4e13","category":"Apple"}
