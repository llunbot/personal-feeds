That changed at least somewhat last night, as Nintendo President Shinto Furukawa <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197\">shared on social media</a> that \"we will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year,\" which ends on March 31, 2025.</p>\n<p>In his pre-announcement announcement, Furukawa warned that an upcoming Nintendo Direct presentation planned for June would include \"no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor,\" suggesting more information may be coming closer to the end of the fiscal year than the beginning.</p>\n<p>Furukawa notes that the eventual announcement will come over nine years after Nintendo <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/nintendo-partners-with-dena-to-develop-mobile-phone-games/\">first alluded to the Switch's existence</a> with the March 2015 announcement of a console then called \"Project NX.\" Nintendo didn't show that hardware publicly until 19 months later, with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/nintendos-next-console-switch-is-a-consoletablet-hybrid/\">a three-minute preview trailer that dropped in October 2016</a>. Hands-on press previews for the Switch came <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/hands-on-with-nintendo-switch-jack-of-all-trades-master-of-some/\">three months after that</a>, and we then had to wait almost two more months for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/nintendo-switch-review/\">the console to finally hit store shelves</a> in March of 2017.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022407#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022407&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e5fe627b0d3bb9f616c6c19225064fade8b3e84c679674bab9171adcd3b07248","category":"Tech"}
