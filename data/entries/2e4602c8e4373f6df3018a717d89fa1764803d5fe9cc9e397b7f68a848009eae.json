But just how big a problem does the women’s peloton have when it comes to finding a healthy balance?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cyclist</em> spoke to a team manager, a sports director and a rider about the numerous complications of managing such growth, and the prevailing mood was one of optimism…</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>The toll of exponential growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/03041624/cyclingimages_-_tdff_2022_-_stage_4_femme-05004-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclingimages_-_tdff_2022_-_stage_4_femme-05004\" /><figcaption>Cyclingimages</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In its inaugural year in 2016, the Women’s WorldTour featured just 17 races, for a total of 34 race days across the season. Forbears of SD Worx-ProTime, Boels-Dolmans, rode to a stunning 13 WWT victories in that first year (along with two WWT GCs, the World Championships Road Race and a host of lower-level race wins). They had a squad of 12 riders, which was pretty average at the time – there was no second tier and there were 40 teams whose squads ranged from as few as eight riders up to as many as 21.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to 2024, and the number of races on the WWT calendar has jumped to 27, with the total number of race days more than doubling to 74. Squad sizes across the 15 WorldTour teams range from 12 riders to 19, but they have more than double the race days to cover – not including any lower-tier races that teams may also race. For now, while the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\" target=\"_blank\">scrap for points</a> that the men’s peloton faces <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/promotion-relegation-uci-rankings-women\" target=\"_blank\">does not exist in the same way</a>, with a further expansion of the calendar in 2025 to include 77 WWT race days, across 28 top-level races, on the surface the situation looks almost untenable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the men have apparently reached a steady state in terms of number of race days and squad sizes; an optimal scenario that allows them to dial in the finer points of performance and really focus on the detail – for better or worse – the women’s sport is still in a state of rapid expansion. With increased interest comes a rise in revenue, with more sponsors drawn to the sport, growing budgets for teams and, crucially, increased wages allowing ever greater numbers of women to turn professional. So far, so good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problems begin to arise when considering the bigger picture. The sport is changing, with racing becoming harder, partly due to an increased level across the board, partly due to improvements in nutrition that allow more riders to be at their best for longer, and partly due to pressures on riders to perform to justify their increased wages and the increased investments of sponsors. Add in the fact that the peloton is smaller, making races more difficult to control, and its shorter race distances allowing for less time to switch off, and what results is a perfect set of conditions to breed fatigue and burnout if squads aren’t managed effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/marlen-reusser\" target=\"_blank\">Marlen Reusser</a> spoke out after she pulled out of the 2023 World Championship ITT part-way through her attempt, citing mental burnout. She described the sensation of being on ‘an infernal and infinite spiral’ in <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/sometimes-you-need-to-say-stop-women-s-cycling-s-burnout-problem\" target=\"_blank\">an interview with <em>Rouleur</em></a><em>,</em> explaining her decision to withdraw: ‘I am not a machine. Cycling has so many great things to offer, so many great races. But it never stops and sometimes you need to say stop.’ This viewpoint was upheld by other top riders. Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig called Reusser ‘brave’ for speaking out, saying, ‘It is becoming so big, so to choose where you want to perform is hard. You need that balance where you can get some days off and with your family and with your loved ones.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+8\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Assembling the puzzle</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/20230726TDFFAZ0032-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"rider attacking at the tour de france femmes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/20230726TDFFAZ0032-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/20230726TDFFAZ0032-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/20230726TDFFAZ0032-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/20230726TDFFAZ0032-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/20230726TDFFAZ0032-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/20230726TDFFAZ0032-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/20230726TDFFAZ0032-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/20230726TDFFAZ0032-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/20230726TDFFAZ0032-A.S.O._Thomas_Maheux.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption>Jeanne Korevaar at the 2023 Tour de France Femmes.</figcaption><figcaption>ASO/Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For team managers and sports directors, achieving a satisfactory balance is a daunting challenge. ‘It felt like there weren’t enough riders to actually fill the teams,’ Dani Christmas, sports director at AG Insurance-Soudal, says of the early days of the Women’s WorldTour. ‘Whereas now we’ve definitely caught up with that, and you see teams growing year on year to try and keep up with the demand that is being placed on them.’ It’s a precarious balance, with a particular pinch-point in terms of race days in the jump from 2022 to 2023. ‘It’s those types of jumps that really make a big difference,’ says Christmas, though she thinks cycling’s awkward scheduling is ‘starting to get a little bit more streamlined’. ‘They’re not going to change most of the calendar because it’s deep-rooted in tradition, but the logistics and the staff structure is going to be more challenging in the latter part of the year,’ she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to clashes, both Christmas and Liv-AlUla-Jayco general manager Gene Bates highlight the gap between the end of the Tour of Scandinavia and the start of the Tour de Romandie: just two days, which necessitates two sets of everything, not just riders but vehicles, resources and support staff. That puts pressure on teams across the board. But beyond logistical issues, there is the very real concern over riders staying fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With squads of up to 30 riders, there is plenty of resource on the men’s side of the sport to send teams to three concurrent races and still have a ‘subs bench’. On the women’s side, the organic growth of squads simply hasn’t reflected the increase in race days, leading to sleepless nights for team managers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It is non-stop for us,’ says Bates, who is pragmatic about the potential pitfalls of having a smaller squad. ‘It’s a double-edged sword. It keeps me up a little bit at night. With 14 riders, it’s nothing to have two go down with broken collarbones, one to get ill, something else happens, and all of a sudden you’re down to ten riders.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When smaller squads are impacted by illness or injury, the knock-on effect can lead to riders who are perhaps unsuited to certain races being forced to make up the numbers. One of Bates’s most experienced riders, Jeanne Korevaar, points out the difficulty for both teams and riders in this case, as a rider more suited to flat classics she says ‘you cannot do a lot as support’ in the latter stages of a mountainous day, and that’s before getting on to fatigue that comes with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s leaders are mostly all-rounders, which can lead to a reliance on particular riders to perform year-round, and that in turn can lead to increased pressure, both physical and mental. Gene Bates agrees. ‘There seems to be a lot of pressure, and I’m not sure if that’s internal pressure from the athletes themselves, or external, from managers and sponsors, with the sudden growth and wage increases,’ he says. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bates believes that with proper management, however, the right balance can be achieved, ‘There’s a bit more thought-processing and planning going into it than probably five to ten years ago, where it was just “right, get out there and race”.’ Korevaar agrees: ‘Ten years ago, you could do all the races. Now you see more that you have to periodise because the level is so high.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a gradual increase in recruitment, this periodisation becomes crucial, and teams can implement a more targeted approach to each race, though there will always be the need for cover. Christmas concurs: ‘It is very much a balancing act and a bit of a puzzle trying to put it together so that you can give every rider a calendar that excites them, with a mix of target races where they know they need to perform at their best, and then some other races where they’re probably going there in more of a helper role.’ Bates agrees that while they ‘really try and go there with defined roles’ when it comes to the Grand Tours, ‘in every other race, there’s going to be one or two that are either preparing for the next race or they’re just in a supporting role.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n

it’s easy to assume that life might be tougher for the top echelon of women these days, many of the challenges outlined above are not unique to women’s cycling. Cycling as a sport is a complex system, but as the women’s peloton hurtles along the upward trajectory towards its – hopefully – optimal state, the myriad issues facing riders and team staff are offset more and more by positive opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, with a limited schedule and a diminutive peloton, riders needed to be able to do everything if their teams had any hope of celebrating a victory in a relatively brief season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I think ten years ago you had to be good at everything to get a contract because there wasn’t really enough of any kind of race,’ Christmas says. These days, with a broader suite of options available, riders are not expected to be able to do it all. Korevaar has been part of the Women’s WorldTour since its inception and says, ‘You see the change that we get with the riders that really go for general classification or really go for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\" target=\"_blank\">spring Classics</a>, instead of what you saw with, like, Annemiek [van Vleuten] – riders that can do everything.’ And she agrees that despite having to make difficult decisions about how to specialise, the increased number of races affords riders the opportunity to make the best of themselves as athletes. ‘You really work for that, because you can’t get better at everything,’ she says. ‘It’s also fun to see that you can really get better in things, if you take the time and really go for it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not all doom and gloom for staff either. Bates is keen to highlight the positives of an increasing number of race days, ‘I actually welcome it,’ he says. ‘I think it’s fantastic, a great opportunity to showcase our athletes to our sponsors and get more value for them. It gives them more to look forward to and for us to promote as a team as well.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-work-and-no-play-1\" target=\"_blank\">part one of this mini-series</a>, <em>Cyclist</em> reported on the senior generation of male riders who are relatively unified in their dissatisfaction with the direction the sport is headed, and <a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/dnlbenson/p/julian-alaphilippe-its-not-all-about?r=7n1qa&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email\" target=\"_blank\">Julian Alaphillippe has added his voice</a> to the collective, bemoaning the loss of instinct in racing, saying, ‘There is less space for instinct, for joy, for happiness. It’s more all about calculation.’ In a sport where the peak has been reached, ever greater steps must be taken to differentiate between the best and the very best. The number one change for the women, according to Bates, is the exponential increase in wages, while the evolution towards this optimal state on the science and data side is still ‘in its infancy’ – though he expects it to follow suit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, there remains a palpable sense of excitement, energy and motivation among those involved with women’s cycling, not only for where we are now, but for what is still to come. While frustrations persist, on the whole the growth is not only welcomed but celebrated, with increased professionalism affording new opportunities to the women who are capable of taking the step up to the highest level of the sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As to whether it’s still fun, both Bates and Christmas agree that there’s a time and a place. ‘It’s a different sport to what it was,’ Christmas admits. ‘A lot of the riders take it very, very seriously. In the past years, it’s exploded in terms of the professionalism that we’re seeing.’ Bates insists that while ‘knowing when it’s time for business’ is important, he adds that ‘the fun element is critical. If we take that away we’re taking away from the reason why they do it. And yes, it’s nice to get paid well, to do what you do, but at the same time, if that’s all you’re doing it for, it won’t last.’ Christmas agrees that there must be a balance between fun and professionalism, to give riders ‘the physical stimulus, but also the mental one as well’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By comparison with the men, she concludes: ‘We’re in a good place. So I think they can learn something from us?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thanks to Daniël of </em><a href=\"https://x.com/StatsOnCycling\" target=\"_blank\"><em>@statsoncycling</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/cyclingoracle\" target=\"_blank\"><em>@cyclingoracle</em></a><em> for help with collating statistical data.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-work-and-no-play-2\">All work and no play part 2: The women’s peloton is walking the tightrope</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"2e4602c8e4373f6df3018a717d89fa1764803d5fe9cc9e397b7f68a848009eae","category":"Cycling"}
