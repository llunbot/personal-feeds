Opened in 1980 by the father of current owner Neil Bilsland, the family-run business has been at the heart of Scotland’s racing and riding scene for decades. It gives back to the community it helped create and a visit has to be at the top of any cycling sightseer’s must-do list – if only for the infectious enthusiasm Neil has for the world he was born into.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Local heroes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I started working here as a youngster in the early 1990s,’ Neil says. ‘Child labour laws don’t apply to family businesses – or so my father tells me! This shop is pretty much all I’ve known. Its history is all over its walls, from Philippa York’s polka dot jersey, a Peugeot bike from the same era, Katie Archibald’s rainbow jersey, Neah Evans’ national champion’s jersey and even going back to my grandfather Arthur Campbell’s time. He was president of the Scottish Cyclists Union and the British Federation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘There’s a poster on the wall from the 1980 Worlds, with his head popping out of the commissaire’s car; we have his commissaire badges going back to Fausto Coppi winning in 1953. There are generations of cycling represented in the shop; it’s a shame I’m a better retailer than I’d ever be a rider.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>At your service</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Being family-run and independent means when you come in you deal with the owner,’ Neil says. ‘We’re all here because we love speaking to customers, helping and following them in their cycling journey – whether it’s their first commuter bike or, in a few years’ time, their race bike.We’ve been dealing with some of our customers for 20 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If it’s got two wheels, we’ll fix it. And bike-fits have become a much bigger part of what we do. Because almost every bike’s front end is proprietary, the shop that sells you the bike is going to be the best shop to fit you, because they’ll have the correct bars, the correct stem and the experience of that kind of system.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A global family</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘For the 2014 Commonwealth Games, the Malawian team brought their bikes in for a service,’ Neil says. ‘The bikes were OK but we ended up lending them two bikes for the road race and one of the staff members’ time-trial bikes for the TT. There’s a Scotland-Malawi partnership now. For the World Championships in August last year, a Malawi rider came across for three weeks with just a rucksack. So we provided bikes, transfers… I even did his washing for him!</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"642\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/pinarello-glasgow-2-642x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/pinarello-glasgow-2-642x970.jpg 642w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/pinarello-glasgow-2-198x300.jpg 198w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/pinarello-glasgow-2-768x1161.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/pinarello-glasgow-2-1016x1536.jpg 1016w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/pinarello-glasgow-2-750x1134.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/pinarello-glasgow-2-1140x1723.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/pinarello-glasgow-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Also during the Worlds, we had the only athlete representing Vatican City come to the shop. In the morning, we were sorting out the Malawi team, then in the afternoon, we worked on that guy’s bike. It was a Pinarello but it needed the gearing sorted.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Great escape</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We are pretty much smack bang in the city centre, but Glasgow Green, one of the biggest parks in Glasgow, is adjacent to the shop. From there, the National Cycle Network gives you options in every direction – north, south, east and west. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘To get out of the city by bike to nice, ‘roadie’ roads is only about 5km in any direction. North of the city is the Campsie Fells and the Carron Valley, including two classic climbs: the Crow Road and the Tak-Ma-Doon. You’re never very far from a good climb.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Italian connection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Pinarello has been fantastic for the shop,’ Neil says. ‘So good in fact that it makes me slap myself in the forehead and ask why I haven’t been selling Pinarello bikes for 15 years. We’ve talked about the history of the shop, but Pinarello’s own history in cycling is unmatched. I grew up watching Miguel Induráin winning the Tour de France, then we had the dominance of Team Sky. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘And obviously Pinarello’s bikes are amazing. The X Series, for example, just fits people so well. Whether you’re as short as 4ft 11in or as tall as 6ft 5in, there’s a Pinarello that will fit you.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• <a href=\"https://billybilslandcycles.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to find out more about Billy Bilsland Cycles in Glasgow</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/pinarello-billy-bilsland-cycles\">Pinarello focus: Billy Bilsland Cycles, Glasgow</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"186b368dc080f9aee0ee2291c4f0aa2ae950a6da1da77f0c8065f933d90607e9","category":"Cycling"}
