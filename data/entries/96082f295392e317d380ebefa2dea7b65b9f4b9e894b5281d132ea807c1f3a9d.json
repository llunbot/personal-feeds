{"title":"9to5Mac on The Talk Show Livestream Returning to Theater for VisionOS","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/05/theater-the-talk-show-live-3d/","date":1749160880000,"content":"\n<p>Nice write-up from Zac Hall at 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Theater for visionOS <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/10/sandwich-debuts-theater-for-vision-pro-with-exclusive-the-talk-show-live-event-in-immersive-video/\">premiered</a> a year ago with a clever\nsoftware launch campaign: exclusively streaming John Gruber’s The\nTalk Show post-WWDC event live with 3D video.</p>\n\n<p>The Apple Vision Pro app has continued to mature since its debut,<a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/06/the-best-plex-video-player-for-apple-vision-pro-just-got-way-better/\">\nadding extensive Plex support</a> and <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/12/23/apple-vision-pro-just-got-a-planetarium-and-its-friggin-awesome/\">a full-blown immersive\nplanetarium</a> that now hosts the <a href=\"https://sandwich.vision/press/partners/resolution-press-release.html\">2025 SXSW award-winning\n“Resolution” music experience</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Next up, Theater is returning as the exclusive home to The Talk\nShow Live event stream.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First, as Hall points out, if you haven’t heard or thought about the Theater app for VisionOS since my show last year, there is now a ton of interesting immersive content there. Second, I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve read commentary, or listened to people on podcasts, wonder why there are hardly any “<em>just make it feel like you’re there, in the audience, for the show</em>” immersive shows for VisionOS.</p>\n\n<p>That’s what Sandwich Vision did last year, and is doing even better this year, with my show. I thought it was kind of odd that it was me, of all people, and my once-a-year, not-that-big-a-deal-outside-the-Apple-nerd-media-world show, who was the first to livestream an immersive show experience for VisionOS. Maybe there were others first for Meta’s low-res headsets, but if there were, I’m not aware of them. My show last year really might have been first for any immersive headset.</p>\n\n<p>Afterward, I figured by this year, while it might not be commonplace — simply because Vision Pro ownership is, you know, not that high — it wouldn’t be unusual. But it still is. I honestly don’t get why that is. Anyway, like I wrote in the previous post, if you can make the show, <a href=\"https://ti.to/daringfireball/the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2025\">you really should attend</a>. But if you can’t make the show, you definitely should watch live <a href=\"https://theater.sandwich.vision/\">in Theater</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/05/9to5mac-on-the-talk-show-livestream-returning-to-theater\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"96082f295392e317d380ebefa2dea7b65b9f4b9e894b5281d132ea807c1f3a9d","category":"Tech"}
