{"title":"Apple Introduces M4 iMacs, With Updated Colors, a Nano-Texture Display Option, and USB-C Input Peripherals","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-introduces-new-imac-supercharged-by-m4-and-apple-intelligence/","date":1730147568000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Newsroom, in the first of what I expect to be a few days’ worth of M4 Mac updates:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The new iMac is available in an array of beautiful new colors, and\nthe 24-inch 4.5K Retina display offers a new nano-texture glass\noption. iMac features a new 12MP Center Stage camera with Desk\nView, up to four Thunderbolt 4 ports, and color-matched\naccessories that include USB-C.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The new colors don’t seem all that different from the old ones, except for green, which seems much more <em>just-plain-green</em> green. The old iMac green was more like teal? It also seems like maybe the new colors are a bit less saturated on the back?</p>\n\n<p>As a don’t-know-how-I-lived-without-it fan of the nano-texture Studio Display, I’m glad to see a nano-texture option available for the M4 iMacs. (It’s a $200 upgrade.) Fingers crossed that they offer a nano-texture option for the M4 MacBook Pros.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/28/m4-imacs-introduced\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d9894abdd8c80d308bc3b9f8bb54c282b23c268adc1c1f427e58cc68448ee5e0","category":"Tech"}
