It’s where the important business happens. Amongst all that, however, is new gear on display from some of the top cycling brands dotted throughout the convention floors.</p>\n<p>Here’s what caught our attention on day 3.</p>\n<p><strong>Also read:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/03/allite-super-magnesium-rims-reduce-vibrations-better-than-carbon-taipei-cycle-show-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">Allite Super Magnesium rims reduce vibrations better than carbon – Taipei Cycle Show 2023</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/03/random-finds-from-day-2-of-the-taipei-cycle-show-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">Random finds from day 2 of the Taipei Cycle Show 2023</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/03/opening-day-at-the-taipei-cycle-show-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">Opening day at the Taipei Cycle Show 2023</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Selle Italia Novus Boost Evo 3D</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505953-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<p><a href=\"http://cyclingtips.com/tag/Selle-Italia\" target=\"_blank\">Selle Italia</a> was a little bit late to the game on the whole 3D-printed saddle thing, following in the footsteps of Fizik and Specialized. But, as is a common refrain for those arriving at a concept second, or a distant third, the brand says it took the time to develop the tech and make it even better. For Selle Italia that has meant developing its own lattice structure to better control the different cushioning zones within the saddle.</p>\n<p>Now, after introducing its first model last summer, the Italian brand is already on to its second offering of the new-age tech.</p>\n<p>Like the first 3D printed model, the SLR Boost 3D, the Novus Boost Evo 3D is not a completely new model. Instead, it takes an existing model’s form factor and swaps out the padding for a 3D-printed polymer.</p>\n<p>The Novus Boost Evo 3D is a slightly more cushioned saddle than the SLR Boost, but is still billed as a race saddle and is chosen by many of the brand’s sponsored road cycling athletes. It also features a different padding lattice structure than the SLR Boost 3D.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505955-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /><figcaption><span><span>The Novus Boost Evo 3D </span></span><span>has a different lattice structure than Selle Italia’s first 3D printed model, the SLR Boost 3D.<br />\n</span></figcaption></figure>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505956-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /><figcaption><span>The SLR Boost 3D was Selle Italia’s first 3D-printed model.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>It will hit the market soon.<span> </span></p>\n<h2>New gravel handlebars from FSA</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505977-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<p><a href=\"http://cyclingtips.com/tag/FSA\" target=\"_blank\">FSA</a> is stepping up its gravel options for 2023 with two new models, one carbon and one alloy. The K-Force Loop AGX Carbon handlebar features ergonomic hand shapes at the hoods and drop bars, as well as the 25° flared drops that make gravel bars gravel bars. There’s 100mm of drop and 70mm of reach. For those not racing the pro category at Unbound, there’s a clip on carbon aero bar, or loop rather, extension. With the extensions, the package weighs 320 grams. Available in 420 mm, 440 mm, and 460 mm.<span> </span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505976-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /><figcaption>The Pro-Wing AGX brings similar specs, but in an alloy version.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The Pro-Wing AGX<span>  </span>is an alloy version with the same specs, just with a corresponding weight penalty (472 grams total weight) for the material change, and the loop is a permanent fixture.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505973-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /><figcaption><span>The Vibration Absorption Stem.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>There’s a new gravel stem in the mix as well, the VAS (Vibration Absorption Stem). The 291-gram stem features a polyurethane damping insert that surrounds the bar and sits between it and the stem, absorbing up to a claimed 47 percent of vibrations. There are three different polyurethane sleeves included, each with a different level of damping. This -6° stem is available in 80, 90, and 100 mm lengths.<span> </span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505974-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /><figcaption><span>The stem comes with three different sleeves, each with a different damping level. </span></figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Vision Metron wheels with the latest Power Ratchet System hubs</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505971-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<p><a href=\"http://cyclingtips.com/tag/Vision\" target=\"_blank\">Vision</a> had its high-end Metron SL range on display, complete with the 91mm deep Metron 91 SL, Metron 60 SL and Metron 45 SL. All three are disc brake wheels and weigh 1850, 1490, and 1390 grams respectively, per pair.

The hubs weigh 108 grams and 232 grams front and rear and contain a whopping 72 teeth within the clutch ratchet for engagement every 5°. That means that nearly as soon as you apply power, the free hub should engage and turn those watts into movement.<span> </span></p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505965-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /><figcaption>An exploded view of the PRS rear hub was on view.</figcaption></figure></figure>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505970-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /><figcaption>This cut-away version reveals all those 72 teeth doing their thing as well.</figcaption></figure></figure>\n<h2>Giant Revolt X Advanced Pro 0</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505996-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<p><a href=\"http://cyclingtips.com/tag/Giant\" target=\"_blank\">Giant</a> is getting in on the gravel suspension trend with the Revolt X Advanced Pro. It features a 40mm travel fork paired to a frame whose geometry has been adjusted to account for the taller fork. There’s also an included dropper post allowing this bike to get a little rowdy — though you can swap in Giant’s compliant D-Fuse rigid post or any round 30.9mm round seatpost if you like.<span> </span></p>\n<p>Big tire clearance adds more capability. Thanks to a flip chip in the rear dropout, the bike can accept up to a whopping 53mm tires.<span> </span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505998-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /><figcaption><span>Gravel suspension is a polarizing topic, but of there are people who want it, brands are going to make it. </span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The highest spec version was on display at the show, the $8,500 Revolt X Advanced Pro 0, but if that cooks your budget, there are two more build specs available at $6,200 and $4,800.<span> </span></p>\n<h2>KMC Racing Duo</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505767-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<p>In the quest for more efficiency, <a href=\"http://cyclingtips.com/tag/KMC\" target=\"_blank\">KMC</a> has developed a chainring and chain meant to be paired with one another for maximum watt savings. The brand calls the chainring teeth “jaws” and they cradle the chain rollers for a better chain-chainring interface. The chain itself has been upgraded as well with enhanced rollers and better chamfering.<span> </span></p>\n<p>KMC claims the Racing Duo lets a rider go 5 percent farther in a given time span when riding at 400 watts, though the brand doesn’t say what that is compared to.<span> </span></p>","author":"Will Tracy","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"f8595c4ce71b74119396f6830a80d9b999afb852d6c2108441f15bc7da988308","category":"Cycling"}
