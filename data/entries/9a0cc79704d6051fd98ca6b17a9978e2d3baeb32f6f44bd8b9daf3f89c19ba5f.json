On Tuesday, the company released a trailer for <em>Star Wars: Visions</em>, a series of short animated films that debuts on Disney+ on September 22. <em>Visions</em> will look strikingly different from other animated Star Wars escapades; the shorts were made by seven Japanese anime studios, each with its own distinct aesthetic.</p>\n<p>There are nine shorts in total: \"The Duel\" by Kamikaze Douga; \"Lop and Ochō\" by Geno Studios (Twin Engine); \"Tatooine Rhapsody\" by Studio Colorido (Twin Engine); \"The Twins\" and \"The Elder\" by Trigger; \"The Village Bride\" by Kinema Citrus; \"Akakiri\" and \"T-B1\" by Science Saru; and \"The Ninth Jedi\" by Production IG.</p>\n<p>\"We really wanted to give these creators a wide creative berth to explore all the imaginative potential of the Star Wars galaxy through the unique lens of anime,\" said executive producer James Waugh <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/news/anime-expo-lite-star-wars-visions\">during a panel at Anime Expo Lite in early July</a>. \"We realized we wanted these to be as authentic as possible to the studios and creators who are making them, made through their unique process, in a medium they’re such experts at.
