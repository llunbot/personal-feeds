The feature, which is still under development, may streamline the process of creating game worlds on the popular online platform, potentially opening up more aspects of game creation to those without extensive 3D design skills.</p>\n\n<p>Roblox has not announced a specific launch date for the new AI tool, which is based on what it calls a \"3D foundational model.\" The company shared a demo video of the tool where a user types, \"create a race track,\" then \"make the scenery a desert,\" and the AI model creates a corresponding model in the proper environment.</p>\n<p>The system will also reportedly let users make modifications, such as changing the time of day or swapping out entire landscapes, and Roblox says the multimodal AI model will ultimately accept video and 3D prompts, not just text.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048533#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048533&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0c74efd5bc2f3e250bd47f5ae83e6c97c9fa69261821afbe8854496a69446b5a","category":"Tech"}
