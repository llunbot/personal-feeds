[credit:\n                              Nintendo                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>Nintendo's Switch launched in March 2017, and all available information indicates that the company is on track to announce a successor early next year. It's that timing that makes the launch of Nintendo's latest Switch accessory so odd: The company has announced a first-party charging cradle for Joy-Con controllers, which up until now have been charged by slotting them into the console itself, via Nintendo's sold-separately <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N33MFPK/?tag=arstech20-20\">Joy-Con charging grip</a>, or with third-party charging accessories.</p>\n<p>The Nintendo of Europe account on X, formerly Twitter, <a href=\"https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1813846178439557413\">announced</a> that the charging accessory—formally called the \"Joy-Con Charging Stand (Two-Way)\"—will be released on October 17. It will work with both Joy-Cons and the <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-entertainment-system-controllers/\">Switch Online wireless NES controllers</a>, and the charging cradle can be separated from its stand (where it looks a lot like the Joy-Con charging grip but without the grip part).</p>\n<p>Power is provided via a USB-C port on top of the stand, which can either be connected to one of the Switch dock's USB ports or to a separate USB-C charger. Other Switch controllers, including the Pro Controller and the SNES and N64 replica controllers, are charged via USB-C directly.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037837#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037837&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0e776d0b2564c5261f8967070369e08f0b2c1ca0d318577ef767a75a6f7a0a36","category":"Tech"}
