Trump's mug shot, from his indictment in Fulton County, Georgia, would not be seen after its Thursday afternoon release.</p>\n<p>This included the Nintendo Wii News Channel. If you still have a Wii console hooked up in your living room, you can, with <a href=\"https://wii.guide/get-started\">an exploit</a>, an <a href=\"https://wii.guide/hbc\">SD card</a>, and some patience, still have an active News Channel on your Wii. If you were checking 2023's news on your 2006 console Thursday, you could have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Squibbus/status/1694960505159369169?t=A4V9CcXKrQwGuggEPmY6pA&amp;s=19\">seen Trump's image</a> in all its fuzzy, compressed notoriety. This inadvertent performance art was made possible by RiiConnect24, a service that has been providing Wii owners with online connectivity for a longer period than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jacg231102/status/1601789803032215552\">even Nintendo originally offered</a>.</p>\n<div><blockquote><p>I'M CRYING <a href=\"https://t.co/QRHoMyFl3h\">https://t.co/QRHoMyFl3h</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ZHknpMAM6r\">pic.twitter.com/ZHknpMAM6r</a></p>— Squibbus (@Squibbus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Squibbus/status/1694960505159369169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 25, 2023</a></blockquote></div>\n<p>Full disclosure: I am a sincerely soft target for a loosely organized crew of <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/33398/rebble-with-a-cause-how-pebble-watches-got-their-amazing-afterlife\">hackers keeping a service running long beyond its corporate end of life</a>. RiiConnect24 certainly falls in that category.
