The decision came from GCN+’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery to ‘consolidate its streaming services to offer more content in fewer places.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Launched in 2021, the GCN+ app hosted a plethora of live racing and over 200 cycling videos, films and documentaries. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What happens to existing GCN+ subscribers?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A statement released by Warner Bros. Discovery Sports UK says: ‘For live coverage they enjoyed on GCN+, customers will be directed to an appropriate platform – such as discovery+, Eurosport or Eurosport Extra in European territories, and be able to sign up to those services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Pro-rata refunds will be given to subscribers from December 19 onwards.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An announcement by Warner Bros. Discovery for where those outside of Europe can enjoy live racing will come soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Global Cycling Network posted on its YouTube channel that the show ‘will go on’, with GCN content continuing.
