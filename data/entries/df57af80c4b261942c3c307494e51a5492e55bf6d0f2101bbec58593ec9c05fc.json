The Birdfy camera connects to Wi-Fi and images that are captured are sent to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> app for viewing anywhere. The app is able to identify and catalog different bird species, providing real-time notifications when there are visits.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's a dual-lens front camera able to capture wide-angle views and bird portraits, and a side camera that provides another angle. The cameras offer 1080p quality with auto-tracking and full color night vision.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBirdfy's new multi-camera feeder is made from recycled ABS plastic for durability, and it has a solar panel that allows it to be placed anywhere in the yard without needing to be regularly recharged. IP66 waterproofing keeps it safe even in rain.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's also a <a href=\"https://www.birdfy.com/products/birdfy-bath-pro\">Birdfy Bath Pro</a>, which provides a water source for birds while also capturing images of birds bathing and playing. There's a wide-angle camera that can take photos and video clips, and the lens is able to zoom in to take close-up portraits. An integrated solar panel allows for a continuous power source, and there's an optional stand that can be purchased.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/birdfy-bird-bath.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1127\" height=\"634\" />\r<br />\nFor hummingbird fans, there's a new Hum Feeder, a more compact, lightweight, and affordable version of the company's original hummingbird feeder. The Hum Feeder has a flower-shaped design with a swivel feeding port, a 14oz nectar capacity, and a built-in 1080p camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Birdfy Feeder 2 Duo is priced at $360 and it is <a href=\"https://www.birdfy.com/collections/best-selling-products/products/birdfy-feeder-2-duo\">available for pre-order now</a>.
