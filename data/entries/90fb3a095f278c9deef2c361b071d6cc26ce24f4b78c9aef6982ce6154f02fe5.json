Control Center, the pull-down menu in the top-right, now has multiple swipe-accessible controls, accessed through a strange-until-you're-used-to-it long continuous swipe from the top. Developers are also getting access to the Control Center, so they can add their own apps' controls. The lock screen will also get more customization, letting you swap out the standard flashlight and camera buttons for other items you prefer.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030149#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030149&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"90fb3a095f278c9deef2c361b071d6cc26ce24f4b78c9aef6982ce6154f02fe5","category":"Tech"}
