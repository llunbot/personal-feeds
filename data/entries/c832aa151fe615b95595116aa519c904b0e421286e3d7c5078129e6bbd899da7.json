The official name is Asia Pacific (Jakarta) and the API name is <strong>ap-southeast-3</strong>. The AWS Asia Pacific (Jakarta) Region is the tenth active AWS Region in Asia Pacific and mainland China along with Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Ningxia, Osaka, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, and, Tokyo. With this launch, AWS now spans 84 Availability Zones within 26 geographic regions around the world.

(Jakarta) Region</strong></span><br /> As is the case with all of the newer AWS Regions, you need to explicitly enable this one in order to be able to create and manage resources within it. To learn how to do this, read <strong>Using the Asia Pacific (Hong Kong) Region</strong> in my post, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-asia-pacific-hong-kong-region/\">Now Open – AWS Asia Pacific (Hong Kong) Region</a>.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Connectivity, Edge Locations, and Latency</strong></span><br /> Jakarta is already home to a <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\">Amazon CloudFront</a> edge location that was opened <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/03/cloudfront-launch-indonesia/\">earlier this year</a>, along with two brand-new <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/\">AWS Direct Connect</a> locations. In addition to this in-country infrastructure, there are more than sixty other edge locations and multiple regional edge caches in Asia, as detailed on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/\">AWS Global Infrastructure</a> page.</p> \n<p>The region offers low-latency connections to other AWS regions in the area. Here are the latest numbers:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/11/19/cgk_latency_3.png\" /></p> \n<p>Many AWS services give you options to replicate your data across multiple AWS regions. You can <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/amazon-s3-replication-adds-support-for-multiple-destinations-in-the-same-or-different-aws-regions/\">replicate S3 buckets to multiple destinations</a> (and use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/s3-multi-region-access-points-accelerate-performance-availability/\">Multi-Region Access Points</a> so your users access the closest one), <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-ami-copy-between-regions/\">copy EC2 AMIs between regions</a>, set up <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cross-region-read-replicas-for-amazon-aurora/\">cross-region Amazon Aurora Read Replicas</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/cross-region-replication-in-amazon-ecr-has-landed/\">replicate container images</a>, and more. You can <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-amazon-dynamodb-global-tables-and-on-demand-backup/\">set up Amazon DynamoDB Global Tables</a> that span any desired regions, and you can <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-almost-inter-region-vpc-peering/\">set up inter-region VPC peering</a>.

This includes the direct AWS supply chain (construction, facility maintenance, electricity, and telecommunications) along with the growth that this drives in the broader Indonesian economy.</p> \n<p>We have been investing in Southeast Asia and Indonesia for many years. The first AWS office in Jakarta opened in 2018 to help support our customers, and now employs developer advocates, solutions architects, account managers, and partner managers, with hiring for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.jobs/en/internal/search?offset=0&amp;result_limit=10&amp;sort=relevant&amp;business_category%5B%5D=amazon-web-services&amp;distanceType=Mi&amp;radius=24km&amp;location%5B%5D=Indonesia%2C%20Jakarta&amp;latitude=&amp;longitude=&amp;loc_group_id=&amp;loc_query=&amp;base_query=&amp;city=&amp;country=&amp;region=&amp;county=&amp;query_options=&amp;\">other roles</a> now underway.</p> \n<p>Back in 2019 we announced a goal to train and empower hundreds of thousands of Indonesians with proficiency in cloud services by 2025. In collaboration with the Indonesian government and with the help of both AWS partners and educational institutions, we have already trained over 200,000 people. We are doing this through multiple routes and programs including:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://canggih.id/aws-gelar-laptop-for-builders-dan-kompetisi-santri-4-0/\"><strong>Laptops for Builders</strong></a> – This is a free program that teaches high school and vocational student in Bahasa, Indonesia about cloud fundamentals.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.dicoding.com/\"><strong>Scholarship Programs</strong></a> – Working closely with tech-education startup <a href=\"https://www.dicoding.com/\">Dicoding</a>, we are offering a free scholarship program for up to 100,000 cloud and back-end developers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn\"><strong>AWS Training &amp; Certification</strong></a> – Attendees are gaining new skills and certifications in areas such as AWS Cloud fundamentals, big data, security, and machine learning, with several <a href=\"https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/external-ecommerce;view=none?ctldoc-catalog-0=l-_id\">training options</a> available.</p> \n<p><span><strong>AWS Customers in Indonesia<br /> </strong></span>We have many amazing customers in Indonesia! Here are a few success stories:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloka.com/en-id/\">Traveloka</a> is a lifestyle superapp with a focus on Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Australia. They offer customers in those countries an end-to-end solution that spans travel, local services, and financial services, all powered by AWS. The company was born in the cloud, and counts on AWS to let them build apps quickly and with high scalability. The <a href=\"https://www.traveloka.com/en-sg/traveloka-flight-ticket-hotel-booking-app\">Traveloka app</a> has been downloaded over 60 million times, making it the most popular travel and lifestyle booking app in Southeast Asia.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.halodoc.com/\">Halodoc</a> is an Indonesian digital health startup. They are currently running a digital reservation program to help Indonesian citizens to book and receive their COVID-19 vaccinations, while also providing the government with easier monitoring and evaluation of the vaccine rollout. During the pandemic, they have also helped to provide testing and telemedicine services, all powered by a digital platform that runs on AWS and that allows them to scale in real-time according to market demand.</p> \n<p>Under the national movement of Learning Freedom (“Merdeka Belajar”), the Indonesian government is working to allow students to access educational resources from anywhere and at any time. Simak Online allows 300,000 students from 430 schools across Jakarta to access their learning materials and assignments, complete homework, take examples, and participate in online forum discussions. Previously hosted on-premises, <a href=\"https://www.simak-online.com/\">Simak Online</a> moved to AWS shortly before COVID-19 broke out in Indonesia. Before the move, they could support exams at just 50 schools simultaneously. Thanks to AWS, they can now scale up and down as needed and can support the national movement and allow students to learn online and on-demand.</p> \n<p><em>A translated version of this post is available on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/id/blogs/indonesia/kini-dibuka-region-aws-asia-pasifik-jakarta/\">AWS Indonesia Blog</a>.</em></p> \n<p>— <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffbarr\">Jeff</a>;</p>","author":"Jeff Barr","siteTitle":"AWS News Blog","siteHash":"6093e072e4117ec22616e844cb857d03ca62c57a411a8affc77cb5e8b6b15bf6","entryHash":"c832aa151fe615b95595116aa519c904b0e421286e3d7c5078129e6bbd899da7","category":"Tech"}
