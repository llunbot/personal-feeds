SRAM sells each of those user-replaceable parts individually from $18-85 (20-93€ / £18-83).

That definitely bugged a lot of mountain bikers coming from the faster-shifting previous generation of AXS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although SRAM says they looked at the numbers (because AXS tracks shifts), with the old setup, 88% of all shifting was single shift in regular use, just 9% a double shift, only 4% a triple shift, and a measly 1% trying to shift 4 gears at once. (<em>Please forgive SRAM’s rounding, not mine</em>.) So with Eagle Mechanical, they figure they could make you happy about 96% of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-9070-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_90-multi-click-or-70-single-click-shifters-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-9070-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_90-multi-click-or-70-single-click-shifters-scaled.webp\" alt=\"MY26 SRAM Eagle 90|70 Mechanical mountain bike T-type Transmission drivetrain, single or multi-click shifter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-9070-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_90-multi-click-or-70-single-click-shifters-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-9070-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_90-multi-click-or-70-single-click-shifters-297x99.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-9070-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_90-multi-click-or-70-single-click-shifters-1536x512.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-9070-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_90-multi-click-or-70-single-click-shifters-120x40.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-9070-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_90-multi-click-or-70-single-click-shifters-768x256.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-9070-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_90-multi-click-or-70-single-click-shifters-2048x683.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Eagle 90 2-click (<em>l</em>) &amp; Eagle 70 Single-Click (<em>r</em>) shifters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the new SRAM Eagle 90 &amp; 70 Mechanical mountain bike transmissions bring back fast multi-shifts, at least for non-ebikes. With 2 shifters available for each groupset, you can pick up to two shifts at a time from the standard MTB shifter. Or there’s a separate eMTB-specific Single Click Shifter so you can’t screw up, even shifting under full power from the ebike’s motor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new shifters also look a bit bigger/longer. That’s because SRAM optimized the new layout to sit closer to the bar and to align your cables with Stealth-routed brake hoses for clean and direct cable routing. A side benefit is shorter shift housing and reduced total cable bend angles for better shift performance overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just a note: new Eagle Mechanical shifting components are NOT backward-compatible with previous SRAM mountain bike or dropbar shifters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New short alloy cranks, too</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-crankset-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-crankset-scaled.webp\" alt=\"MY26 SRAM Eagle 90|70 Mechanical mountain bike T-type Transmission drivetrain, 90 cranks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-crankset-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-crankset-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-crankset-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-crankset-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-crankset-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-crankset-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-crankset-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Eagle Mechanical groups add their own simple forged alloy cranks, adopting the trend of ever-shorter crank arms.

Importantly to note, all T-type Transmission components are also cross-compatible. So if you buy a bike with Eagle 70 or upgrade your bike with Eagle 90 today, you could still swap to a wireless setup with just an AXS shifter &amp; derailleur down the trail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are essentially 4 variants of the new SRAM Eagle Mechanical Transmission – 90 &amp; 70 for mountain bikes and 90 &amp; 70 for eMTBs. The differences just come down to cranks specific to individual ebike motors and the eMTB shifters that allow only one shift at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-groupset-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-groupset-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-groupset-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-groupset-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-groupset-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-groupset-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-groupset-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-groupset-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-SRAM-Eagle-90-Mechanical-mountain-bike-T-type-Transmission-drivetrain_Eagle-90-groupset-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An Eagle 90 complete groupset sells for $670 / 730€ / £655, including the new mechanical rear derailleur, mechanical shifter with a clamp, plus a crankset, GX chain &amp; GX cassette.
