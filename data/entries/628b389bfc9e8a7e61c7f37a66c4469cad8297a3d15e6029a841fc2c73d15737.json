US District Judge Reed O'Connor of the Northern District of Texas, who recently refused to recuse himself from the case despite having purchased Tesla stock, denied Media Matters' motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>X Corp. sued Media Matters after the nonprofit watchdog group published <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/musk-endorses-antisemitic-conspiracy-theory-x-has-been-placing-ads-apple-bravo-ibm-oracle\">research</a> on ads being placed next to pro-Nazi content on X, formerly Twitter. X's lawsuit also names reporter Eric Hananoki and Media Matters President Angelo Carusone as defendants.</p>\n<p>Because of O'Connor's ruling, X can move ahead with its claims of tortious interference with contract, business disparagement, and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. A jury trial is scheduled to begin on April 7, 2025.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046511#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046511&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"628b389bfc9e8a7e61c7f37a66c4469cad8297a3d15e6029a841fc2c73d15737","category":"Tech"}
