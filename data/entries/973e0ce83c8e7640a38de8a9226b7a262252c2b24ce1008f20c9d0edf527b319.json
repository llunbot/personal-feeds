The updated iMac will have 16GB RAM as standard and features a selection of new colors including new shades of purple, pink, green, orange, and a brand new yellow, joining the silver seen on the previous generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this was the first Mac Apple announced would get an M4 chip, it wasn’t the first Apple product to ship with the M4. That chip made its debut in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369843/m4-ipad-pro-1tb-review.html\">iPad Pro</a> earlier in 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The update comes a year after the M3 iMac was released. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2508893/imac-m4-review.html\">Learn more about M4 iMac in our in-depth review</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>M4 iMac: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple announced the availability of the M4 iMac on October 28 and started pre-orders that day. The new iMac will ship on November 8. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pre-order the new iMac now. </p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac\" target=\"_blank\">Order the M4 iMac (U.S.)</a></div>\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/imac\" target=\"_blank\">Order the M4 iMac (U.K.)</a></div>\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>M4 iMac: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The price of the iMac is no different in the U.S., but, as expected, the price has dropped in the U.K.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how the lineup now looks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$1,299/£1,299</strong>: M4, 8-core CPU/8-core GPU, 16GB unified memory, 256GB SSD, 2 Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$1,499/ £1,499</strong>: M4, 10-core CPU/10-core GPU, 16GB unified memory, 256GB SSD, 4 Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$1,699/ £1,699</strong>: M4, 10-core CPU/10-core GPU, 16GB unified memory, 512GB SSD, 4 Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>$1,899/ £1,899</strong>: M4, 10-core CPU/10-core GPU, 24GB unified memory, 512GB SSD, 4 Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s added a new $1,899/£1,899 model with 24GB memory to the lineup. It’s also possible to configure the iMac with 32GB unified memory and up to 2TB SSD.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other build-to-order options include Nano texture glass, discussed below. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>M4 iMac: Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The current design is now four years old. For the 2024 models Apple has updated the color shades on offer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new M4 iMac offers a choice of seven new shades including green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, and blue, alongside silver. As before, the shade is much more bold on the back, with a subtle shade on the front that is designed to be less distracting. There is also a color-matched Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse or optional Magic Trackpad. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-iMac-M4-colors-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"New iMac M4 colors\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The iMac M4 color options. </p><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>The previous generation offered a similar selection of colors, but the shades were a bit bolder. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/m3-imac.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"M3 iMac\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>The iMac M3 color options.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>M4 iMac: Specs and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Processor</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>M4, 8-core CPU/8-core GPU</li>\n\n\n\n<li>M4, 10-core CPU/10-core GPU</li>\n\n\n\n<li>M4, 10-core CPU/10-core GPU</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The main change here is that there are now models with 10-core CPUs. The M3 only offered 8-core CPU with 10-core GPU. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There should be AI enhancements thanks to improvements to the Neural Engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple makes various comparisons with the M1 iMac and the previous Intel iMacs. Making claims that thanks to the M4 Neural Engine the M4 is 3x faster than on iMac with M1, 2.1x faster than iMac with M1 at gaming, and 6x faster than the “most popular Intel-based iMac model”. Of course this tells us little about the generational improvements from the M3 to the M4. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M4 is made using the same 3-nanometer process introduced with the M3. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1953800/apple-m3-cpu-gpu-speed-performance.html\">3nm process</a> allows more transistors to fit on a chip, which should provide a performance boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>RAM/unified memory</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>16GB as standard</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has always sold consumer-focused Macs with 8GB RAM as standard, but this is changing with the arrival of the M4 iMac, and probably as a result of the trend to automate tasks using AI. The new iMac for 2024 will ship with 16GB RAM as standard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The extra unified memory should help with the AI features. Apple has always insisted that 8GB is an adequate baseline amount of RAM, but it looks like this is no longer the case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is now a standard iMac model with 24GB unified memory, and it is possible to configure the iMac with 32GB unified memory. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-imac-features-slide.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple slide showing features of the m4 iMac \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-imac-features-slide.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2512w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-imac-features-slide.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-imac-features-slide.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-imac-features-slide.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-imac-features-slide.jpg?resize=1536%2C863&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-imac-features-slide.jpg?resize=2048%2C1151&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-imac-features-slide.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-imac-features-slide.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Screenshot</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ports and connectivity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The M3 model gained Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. It was thought that Apple might include Bluetooth 5.4 and Wi-Fi 7 in the new model, but it hasn’t. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also a rumor that the iMac could lose its USB-A/USB-3 ports. This rumor was true – there are only Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports on the new iMac. So if you still have old peripherals using the old style USB port it’s time to update. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Display </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Those buying the new M4 iMac get the option of a new nano-texture glass option for the first time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nano-texture glass option costs an extra $200/£200, but reduces reflections and glare, so it’s better suited to , in Apple’s words: “a sun-drenched living room or bright storefront”. Apple says the nano glass also </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Camera &amp; Speakers </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another change is that the M4 iMac gets a new 12MP Center Stage camera with Desk View.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Desk View makes use of the wide-angle lens to show the user and a top-down view of their desk at the same time – ideal for educators and anyone demoing a product. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Center Stage keeps everyone centered on a video call, so you can move around the room and the camera follows you. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The M4 iMac also offers the same studio-quality three-microphone array with beamforming and an immersive six-speaker sound system as previously. </p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple iMac (M4)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1361\" height=\"908\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-iMac-M4-colors-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple iMac (M4)\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-iMac-M4-colors-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1361w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-iMac-M4-colors-.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-iMac-M4-colors-.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-iMac-M4-colors-.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-iMac-M4-colors-.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-iMac-M4-colors-.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MW-Ed-Choice-90x90-1.png\" alt=\"Editors' Choice\" loading=\"lazy\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2508893/imac-m4-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,299 | $1,499 | $1,699 | $1,899\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac\" target=\"_blank\">$1299 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1858924-REG/apple_mwuc3ll_a_imac_8_core_16gb_256gb_silver_24.html/BI/21318/KBID/22251/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1645786/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$1299 at  B&amp;H</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6467303/pdp\" target=\"_blank\">$1299 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"973e0ce83c8e7640a38de8a9226b7a262252c2b24ce1008f20c9d0edf527b319","category":"Apple"}
