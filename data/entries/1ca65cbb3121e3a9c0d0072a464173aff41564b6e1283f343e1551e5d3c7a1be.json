It's 50 percent \"tougher\" than the first-generation ceramic shield, and two times tougher than \"glass found in any other smartphone.\" It's not clear how Apple is defining tougher, but Apple has typically focused more on drop protection than scratch protection when marketing the material.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple first started using the Ceramic Shield material in 2020 with the ‌iPhone‌ 12 models, and at the time, Apple said that it was developed in partnership with Corning. Corning makes the Gorilla Glass that Apple competitors like Samsung use, including the new \"Gorilla Armor\" that Samsung included for the Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the ceramic infused glass appears to be an Apple exclusive.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnce the ‌iPhone 16‌ models launch, we're sure to see a variety of drop and scratch tests that will provide more insight into the benefits of the second-generation Ceramic Shield. Pre-orders for the new devices start this Friday, and an official launch will follow on September 20.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16\">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/iphone-16-ceramic-shield-improvements/\">iPhone 16 Models Get 50% Tougher Ceramic Shield for Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-models-get-50-tougher-ceramic-shield-for-display.2435802/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1ca65cbb3121e3a9c0d0072a464173aff41564b6e1283f343e1551e5d3c7a1be","category":"Apple"}
