Other emoji on the list have shifted position and there are a few that are new to the top 10 list, such as thumbs up and face with hearts.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Unicode Consortium also broke emoji down by category to discover the top used smileys, people emoji, symbols, clothing, animals, travel emoji, objects, and food emoji, with graphs of the frequency of use <a href=\"https://home.unicode.org/emoji/emoji-frequency/\">available on the Unicode Consortium website</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/emoji-smileys-2021.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nParty popper is the most popular event emoji, for example, followed by balloon and gift. Fire is the most popular weather emoji, unsurprisingly, and the most popular plant emoji is the rose.
