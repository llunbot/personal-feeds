This year's count is now higher than anything seen since 2000, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html\">declared the highly contagious virus eliminated from the US</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the start of the year, Oregon has tallied <a href=\"https://www.oregon.gov/oha/ph/diseasesconditions/diseasesaz/pages/measles.aspx\">31 cases of measles, all in unvaccinated people</a>. The cases have been accumulating in sustained waves of transmission since mid-June.</p>\n<p>Last month, when the outbreak tally was still in the 20s, health officials noted that it was nearing a state record set in 2019. There were 28 cases that year, which were linked to a large outbreak across the border in Washington state. But, with that record now surpassed, the state is in pre-elimination territory.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047323#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047323&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"994e8790395be840c5d2228dfe362fff4b2008047e9ee179c505fd42bae9fa92","category":"Tech"}
