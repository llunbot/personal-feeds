It is also compatible with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> and other Qi-based devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA USB-C cable comes along with it for charging purposes, and there's a built-in light sensor that dims at night so it's ideal for the night stand.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Base Station Mini with Magnetic Alignment is available <a href=\"https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-462641-14535369?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fbase-station-mini-magnetic\">from the Nomad website</a> for $69.95.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Nomad.
