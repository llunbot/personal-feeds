The blog cites unverified sources from Alibaba for its information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the dummy units align with previous rumors about the iPhone SE 4's design – showing a device matching the iPhone 14's dimensions with a notched display and single rear camera – the claim of a larger model contradicts all prior reporting on Apple's plans. No other leakers or supply chain reports have mentioned a larger SE model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Mac Otakara</em> has provided accurate information in the past, but has also shared some claims that didn't pan out. The blog itself notes that the \"final precision design and size expansion have not been decided,\" suggesting a degree of uncertainty even in their own reporting. <em>Mac Otakara</em> further underlined its lack of conviction by telling <em>MacRumors</em>: \"It is possible that only the 6.1-inch model will actually be released.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's plans can always change, but the idea of a larger model seems highly improbable based on current information, especially considering <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/cirp-iphone-15-vs-14-sales-q1/\">previous reports</a> of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/28/apple-reevaluate-iphone-15-lineup/\">poor sales of Plus models</a> in its flagship smartphone lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone SE 4 is anticipated to launch in March 2025, and will likely feature Face ID instead of Touch ID, an OLED screen instead of LCD, an A18 chip, a new Apple-designed 5G modem, and a standalone 48MP main camera.
