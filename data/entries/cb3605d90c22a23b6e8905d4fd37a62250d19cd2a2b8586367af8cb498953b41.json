But you shouldn’t when it’s this cheap: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LNQCX/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the M1 MacBook Air for $799</a>, a savings of $200 and matching the lowest price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MacBook Air has Apple’s first M1 processor with just seven GPU cores, but it’s still a very capable machine. In our review, we called its performance “shocking,” and our opinion hasn’t changed more than two years later. With all that speed, you also get a fantastic 13.3-inch display and Magic Keyboard, excellent battery life, and the classic MacBook Air design that Apple abandoned with the latest redesign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re not sure how long this deal will last or how long the MacBook Air will even be around, so if you want one go grab one right now.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cb3605d90c22a23b6e8905d4fd37a62250d19cd2a2b8586367af8cb498953b41","category":"Apple"}
