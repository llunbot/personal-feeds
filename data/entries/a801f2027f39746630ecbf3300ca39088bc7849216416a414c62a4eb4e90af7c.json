In iOS 17, Apple made this process more streamlined if you’re right near another device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Select an item or items to share, like a set of images in the Photos app, tap AirDrop, and then bring the top of your iPhone near the top of someone else’s iPhone. When they get close, both iPhones start to jitter a little bit (as if in excitement), then there’s a flashy animation and a haptic “bump” as the media transfers. This feature works with any iPhone capable of running iOS 17. (Apple’s documentation about how to use it is nearly non-existent for some reason.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the proximity element, a person sending over AirDrop doesn’t need to be in the other person’s contacts. Apple must assume that if you’re that close, it’s an intentional operation by both parties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are other ways to sync and transfer items, AirDrop’s proximity method is a great new piece of glue for reducing the number of steps and often the frustration of AirDrop transfers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
