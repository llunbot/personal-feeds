Surging to the line for a bunch sprint finish, Cavendish beat Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Arnaud De Lie (Lotto Dstny) and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-biniam-girmay\" target=\"_blank\">Biniam Girmay</a> (Intermarché-Wanty) to end his career on a high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the less pressurised nature of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> crits, it won’t have been the most competitive sprint that Cavendish has faced in his long career, but that won’t have bothered him as he crossed the line with his arms in the air one last time. His retirement comes at the end of a year in which he finally claimed the outright record for most Tour de France stage wins from Eddy Merckx with victory on Stage 5 in Saint-Vulbas, his 35th stage success since making his debut at the race back in 2007. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>The last dance… <a href=\"https://t.co/6JJK1lmjEJ\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/6JJK1lmjEJ</a></p>— Tour

announced on LinkedIn that he has left his position as director of racing at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a> to begin a ‘new phase’ of his career after a season of uncertainty about his non-attendance at races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said, ‘I’ve always enjoyed and thrived working in a high-performance environment and I will continue to have significant involvement in the sport. My focus is now on a new challenge within professional cycling.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cummings was notably absent from races such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a>, Tour de France, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-of-britain\" target=\"_blank\">Tour of Britain </a>despite his pivotal position in the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news comes after Ineos Grenadiers revealed a new staff and performance structure for the upcoming season that includes Kurt Asle Arvesen as lead sport director, Tom Helleman from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/dsm-firmenich-postnl\" target=\"_blank\">dsm-firmenich PostNL</a> as lead performance coach and Dr Mehdi Kordi as head of performance support and innovation. The latter worked with the Dutch athletics team that claimed gold medals at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Paris Olympics</a> in the women’s marathon and 4x 400m mixed relay.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>GB Paralympics team subbed</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"962\" height=\"753\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/53961127235_fb3bf8f8d2_o.jpg.article-962.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/53961127235_fb3bf8f8d2_o.jpg.article-962.jpg 962w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/53961127235_fb3bf8f8d2_o.jpg.article-962-300x235.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/53961127235_fb3bf8f8d2_o.jpg.article-962-768x601.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/53961127235_fb3bf8f8d2_o.jpg.article-962-750x587.jpg 750w\" /><figcaption>ParalympicsGB/imagecomms</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/british-cycling-2024-paris-paralympics\" target=\"_blank\">Archie Atkinson</a> has told <em>Cyclist</em> that he agrees with fellow Paralympian Zac Shaw’s comments criticising high-end store Fortum &amp; Mason for effectively snubbing the Paralympics GB team. The department store organised an after-party for Team GB following a reception at Buckingham Palace in which they met the King, but it was only for Team GB and not Paralympics GB.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>Hi <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fortnums?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@Fortnums</a> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44b.png\" alt=\"👋\" /> as you’re aware, the Olympic and Paralympic medalists were invited to Buckingham Palace yesterday. It would be nice to understand why you hosted an after party for the Olympic medalists but made the decision not to invite the Paralympic medalists? Why? <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png\" alt=\"😅\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png\" alt=\"😅\" /></p>— Zac Shaw (@shawzac) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shawzac/status/1854876121159926016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">November 8, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Atkinson, who won a silver medal in the men’s C4 pursuit at the Paralympics this summer, said, ‘We were told to wear tracksuits to meet the King. The Olympics squad had been given suits as kit issue for events like these. We were told they weren’t giving us them for environmental reasons. But if it’s actually funding reasons then I completely understand, I would just rather they be honest about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Having to go to the Palace in a tracksuit makes us stand out and feel inferior to the Olympic athletes who were dressed smartly.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atkinson was able to attend the after-party with Olympian friends, and added they were shocked by the fact Paralympians hadn’t been invited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortnum &amp; Mason has since responded to the after-party snub by saying there is a ‘separate reception in the works’ and that it was a ‘failure of communication on our part’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pro Log will return in 2025.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-log-mark-cavendish-retires\">Pro Log: Mark Cavendish wins final race; Paralympians snubbed; Steve Cummings leaves Ineos Grenadiers</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"9bc4e9c7be72597809420285cc1fdb452b3ade8a69ad7be25a5a5679bae918d8","category":"Cycling"}
