Fair’s simple offset seatpost head hardware lets riders shift their saddle forward or back more than an inch. Because maybe the geometry of your bike isn’t quite as progressive as you’d like. And especially with wireless droppers on some bikes even without internal cable routing, you might not have many other options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another sneaky upgrade in there too, is that Fair also made an ultralight titanium &amp; alloy hardware kit for those happy with the position of their RockShox Reverb AXS dropper, but who want to shed 22g off their bike…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fair Drop Best AXS +/- 27mm of RockShox Reverb offset</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_on-blue-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_on-blue-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Fair Drop Best AXS lightweight offset seatpost head for RockShox Reverb AXS dropper post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_on-blue-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_on-blue-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_on-blue-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_on-blue-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_on-blue-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_on-blue-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_on-blue-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Fair)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fair Drop Best AXS brings their excellent problem-solving offset seatpost head guts to the most popular wireless dropper seatpost.

Then, they followed it up this past spring with a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fair-bicycle-drop-best-uc-seatpost-offset-gives-most-riders-modern-bike-fit-options/\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Compatibility</a> version that could fit most droppers on the market, and a lot of proprietary seatpost heads, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is incredibly simple. By replacing the saddle rail cradle and the upper rail clamp head, Fair’s Drop Best could shift your seating position forward or back, with little to no impact on saddle height. It was an almost magic solution for bikes with too steep or too slack seattube angles. And it was especially helpful for mountain bike riders with especially high or low saddle heights on bikes designed with odd “virtual” seattube angles on account of complex frame/suspension designs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more on my thoughts on why this is a great idea, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fair-bicycle-drop-best-uc-seatpost-offset-gives-most-riders-modern-bike-fit-options/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>here</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the whole setup has been manufactured in Switzerland, and independently ISO tested beyond MTB standards in Germany,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, there still had not been a version that would fit the more unique seat head guts of the Reverb AXS posts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until now!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_angled-up-close-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_angled-up-close-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Fair Drop Best AXS lightweight offset seatpost head for RockShox Reverb AXS dropper post, up close detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_angled-up-close-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_angled-up-close-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_angled-up-close-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_angled-up-close-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_angled-up-close-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, anyone with a wireless Reverb AXS dropper is likely familiar with its 1-bolt adjusting and rail-pinching clamp hardware. Fair’s solution was to replace all of that with a new set of CNC-machined aluminum cradles that fit into the post’s round head, matching rail clamps, and a mix of titanium and alloy hardware to secure it all in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_back-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_back-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Fair Drop Best AXS lightweight offset seatpost head for RockShox Reverb AXS dropper post, back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_back-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_back-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_back-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_back-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_forward-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_forward-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Fair Drop Best AXS lightweight offset seatpost head for RockShox Reverb AXS dropper post, forward\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_forward-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_forward-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_forward-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fair-Drop-Best-AXS-lightweight-offset-seatpost-head-for-RockShox-Reverb-AXS-dropper-post_forward-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In full Drop Best fashion, the Drop Best AXS can be installed forward or reverse to extend your saddle rail adjustment range 27mm in front of or behind the stock position.
