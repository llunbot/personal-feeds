All review \nscores are whole points. We no longer use half points or decimals \nwhen scoring a product. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Utter garbage and an embarrassment. </li>\n<li>A product that should be avoided at all costs. </li>\n<li>Bad — not something we’d recommend. </li>\n<li>Mediocre — has multiple outstanding issues. </li>\n<li>Just okay. This product works well in some areas but likely \nhas significant issues in others. </li>\n<li>Good. There are issues but also redeeming qualities. </li>\n<li>Very good. A solid product with some flaws. </li>\n<li>Excellent. A superb product with minor or very few flaws. </li>\n<li>Nearly perfect. </li>\n<li>The best of the best. </li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those are great descriptions and that’s a useful 10-point scale! But by these guidelines, the AI Pin should have gotten a 2. Maybe a 3, tops, but I’d say “should be avoided at all costs” fits. Definitely far short of 4’s “mediocre”.</p>\n\n<p>But this isn’t the first time <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/03/dell-xps-15-grading-on-a-curve\">I’ve found The Verge’s review scoring incoherent</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/11/the-verge-review-scale\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c96227801511d0e34abbcfb0295da1a8880d7edfc9b7ce356b75aa0681d68f5b","category":"Tech"}
