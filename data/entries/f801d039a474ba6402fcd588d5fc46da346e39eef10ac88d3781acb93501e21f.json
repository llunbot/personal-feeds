Its maker, Louisville, Kentucky-based Justice AV Solutions, says its products are used in more than 10,000 courtrooms throughout the US and 11 other countries. The company has been in business for 35 years.</p>\n<h2>JAVS Viewer users at high risk</h2>\n<p>Researchers from security firm Rapid7 <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/05/23/cve-2024-4978-backdoored-justice-av-solutions-viewer-software-used-in-apparent-supply-chain-attack/\">reported</a> that a version of the JAVS Viewer 8 available for download on javs.com contained a backdoor that gave an unknown threat actor persistent access to infected devices. The malicious download, planted inside an executable file that installs the JAVS Viewer version 8.3.7, was available no later than April 1, when a <a href=\"https://x.com/2RunJack2/status/1775052981966377148\">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) reported it. It’s unclear when the backdoored version was removed from the company’s download page. JAVS representatives didn’t immediately respond to questions sent by email.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026911#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026911&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f801d039a474ba6402fcd588d5fc46da346e39eef10ac88d3781acb93501e21f","category":"Tech"}
