Such thoughts started with road bikes because they tend to have a high level of finishing and tend to be more ornate and flashier. During the Greg Lemond era, Campagnolo C-Record parts—more aerodynamic than their predecessors—seemed to be designed in a form that went well beyond the required function. Never mind that these parts were heavier than their predecessors. However, with all the cables and controls of a road bike, even with aero brake levers, they tended to look cluttered.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2166\" height=\"1218\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/FixedGearGallery.jpg?fit=1200,1218&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/FixedGearGallery.jpg?w=2166&amp;quality=75 2166w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/FixedGearGallery.jpg?resize=1200,675&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/FixedGearGallery.jpg?resize=2000,1125&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/FixedGearGallery.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/FixedGearGallery.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/FixedGearGallery.jpg?resize=2048,1152&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>About 20 years ago I started monitoring the bikes that were submitted by readers to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050831160818/http://www.fixedgeargallery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fixed Gear Gallery</a>, with the goal of identifying the one bike that was the most aesthetically pleasing. What seemed to be apparent from looking over hundreds and hundreds of bikes was: the simpler the bike the better. Clutter was visually distracting to the form.

There were some surprising candidates that caught my eye, including a cheap step-through “swan” city bike that had gracefully flowing frame tubes. The Ibis Scorchers also stood out, mostly because of their pleasantly down-swept handlebars and custom riser stems.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-33.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-33.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-33.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-33.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-33.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-33.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-33.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-33.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-38.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-38.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-38.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-38.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-38.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-34.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-34.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-34.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-34.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-34.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-34.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-34.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/2022-Philly-Bike-Expo-Bishop-Bikes-Track-Bike-34.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2022-philly-bike-expo-gallery-01/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>2022 Philly Bike Expo Bishop Track Bike</em></a></p>\n<p>Amongst the fixed gears, track bikes were categorically distinct because they were both simple in form and designed for the sole purpose of going as fast as possible in circles.

Some lugs hardly have points at all, like the minimalist “bikini” style which became popular in the late 70s with their pleasing swoopy shapes. How lugs are finished can also matter a lot to their visual appearance. Some are left with very distinct edges that look like the flattop mesas of Canyonlands National Park.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-23.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-23.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-23.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-23.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-23.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-23.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-23.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-23.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-29.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-29.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-29.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-29.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-29.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-29.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-29.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-29.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-41.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-41.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-41.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-41.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-41.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-41.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-41.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-41.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>For a while it became common to round off or blunt the edges of lugs, like the short and pointy ones found on a 1970s Schwinn Paramount. Around that same time a number of US builders started spending extra time to gradually taper lugs down to almost nothing while defining the most delicate of edges.  If the paint was too thick, this work could be washed out. Many of these builders would also do lug filling, using silver or brass to ease the transition from one tube direction to another with a small or shallow fillet.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/ChrisBishopLug.jpg?fit=1200,1080&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/ChrisBishopLug.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=75 1920w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/ChrisBishopLug.jpg?resize=1200,675&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/ChrisBishopLug.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/ChrisBishopLug.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cmy-902u8LQ/?igsh=Y2poNHZydHdranR1\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Bishop, lug shaping, 2022</a></em></p>\n<p>In the 1970s, builders like Tom Ritchey and Peter Johnson were purveyors of this art, while today, it can be seen in the exquisite work of Chris Bishop (above).

The chrome finish certainly catches the eye. Some years back, Bianchi offered its Pista fixie/track bike with a chrome finish, and from a distance, it demands attention. However, up close you realize that the TIG-welded construction, while nicely done, isn’t anything worth dwelling on. Maybe that is a clue, this contrast of two scales.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-FINAL.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-FINAL.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-FINAL.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-FINAL.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-FINAL.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>1975 Ritchey Track Bike</h3>\n<p>If you see the Ritchey track bike from afar, you will notice the overall form, beginning with the proportions. There is the size of the frame, the slender tubing, the competitive gear ratio, and just the right amount of seat post and stem extension. There is, of course, the chrome finish, which unfortunately has suffered in spots over its nearly 50-year life, but this isn’t so apparent from a distance. Up close, one immediately starts to pick up on the frame details including the refined lug work, the made-from-scratch fork crown with tight clearance, the fastback seat binder, and “park bench” chainstay brace.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-10.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-10.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-10.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-10.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-10.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-10.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-10.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-34.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-34.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-34.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-34.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-34.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-34.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-34.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-34.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>After that, one might notice the component selection and modifications, including the drilled chainring and crank and the lack of dust covers on the hubs.

With that in mind, it’s worth asking whether this whole discussion is about something objective or subjective, or some combination. We’re not all going to agree. That’s why each of us has favorite builders, brands, components, and paint colors. We might shake our heads at the bikes other people are passionate about, but that’s what keeps it all so interesting. But this aesthetic quest certainly keeps me searching for the perfect bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-20.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-20.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-20.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-20.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-20.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-20.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-20.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-21.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-21.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-21.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-21.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-21.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-21.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-21.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-22.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-22.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-22.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-22.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-22.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-22.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1975-Tom-Ritchey-Track-Bike-22.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The hope is always there that maybe the next bike a builder creates, or the next bike seen locked to a public rack, will raise the bar higher, yet only in a relative sense.
