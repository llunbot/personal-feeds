We’ve probably all come across somone still rocking an iPhone 8, as a mere battery swap typically gives these devices a new lease on life. Nevertheless, Apple has been really boosting the iPhone lately, which could entice certain customers to upgrade more often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1070324/iphone-14-pro-review.html\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> is just two years old, you may find yourself coveting an iPhone 16 Pro upgrade this fall. After all, Apple has made some significant changes in the past couple of years, and if the rumors about the iPhone 16 Pro features are true, there are at least ten reasons why this upgrade may not feel like just a minor step.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>1. Apple Intelligence</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of iOS 18’s biggest highlights is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a>. Coming later this year, this native AI solution will supercharge your mobile computing experience. Well, except that it’s not coming to your iPhone 14 Pro, as it’s restricted to the 15 Pro and future models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By upgrading to an iPhone 16 Pro, you’ll be unlocking advanced features like email and notification summaries, text enhancement tools, image and emoji generators, and more. Apple Intelligence on its own could notably impact how you use your device, let alone when bundled with the hardware changes we will list below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>2. Titanium design</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the iPhone 15 Pro models, Apple retired the stainless steel body in favor of a titanium one. While on paper this may seem like a trivial tweak, it actually makes a lot of difference. For starters, the company redistributed the internal weight, which causes the phone to feel lighter, especially when held for prolonged periods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, Apple rounded the frame and got rid of the sharp edges that would leave marks on your fingers when used for a long time. So, despite personally upgrading from an iPhone 14 Pro to the (heavier) 15 Pro Max, I found myself operating the new handset more comfortably.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the ergonomics, titanium is less prone to scratches and fingerprint marks than stainless steel. This makes it look fresher and less worn out. And with the iPhone 16 Pro models, Apple is rumored to apply a glossy layer on the frame to further enhance the cosmetics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3. Larger displays</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, flagship iPhones, including the 14 Pro, have been offering 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch variants. This could be changing this fall, as rumors point to larger iPhone 16 Pro models. If the leaked details turn out to be accurate, the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max will feature 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays, respectively. This would make the viewing experience much more immersive and comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>4. Improved display</strong> performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of displays, rumors also suggest that the iPhone 16 Pro models will be adopting finer OLED panels. Apple is reportedly looking into the the micro-lens technology, which would increase the display’s brightness while maintaining the same power consumption. Alternatively, the company could rely on this technology to retain the current brightness while consuming less energy. Regardless of the route Apple takes, the iPhone 16 Pro’s screen is expected to outshine that of the 14 Pro. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 15 Pro Max cameras\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPhone 15 Pro Max cameras\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPhone 15 Pro Max cameras\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-2.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>5. Superior cameras</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone is many users’ primary (and even sole) camera, as it has advanced enough to capture high-resolution moments. While the iPhone 14 Pro packs an excellent 48MP wide lens, upgrading to a 16 Pro model will unlock even more advanced photography tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starers, the smaller iPhone 16 Pro is rumored to adopt the 15 Pro Max’s tetraprism lens. This would extend the maximum digital zoom from 15x to 25x and the optical one from 3x to 5x.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you opt for the iPhone 16 Pro Max variant, then you may be able to utilize a super telephoto periscope lens, which could increase the optical zoom beyond 5x and enhance portrait shots of faraway subjects. That’s not to mention that the ultra-wide lens’ resolution is expected to receive a welcome bump from 12MP to 48MP.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>6. Action button</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the original iPhone, every Apple smartphone had had a Silent switch. Since many of us keep their phones muted at all times, the company decided to give users more choice. Starting with the iPhone 15 Pro models, an Action button has replaced the classic switch. It allows users to remap its functionality, and will get even <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2398097/ios-18-public-beta-features-to-try-first.html\">more flexible and useful in iOS 18</a>. This includes taking photos, recording audio, translating, triggering actions from the Shortcuts app, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if the Silent toggle doesn’t mean much to you, you’ll particularly appreciate the Action button when you upgrade your iPhone 14 Pro to a 16 Pro.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 15 Pro action button\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPhone 15 Pro action button\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPhone 15 Pro action button\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iPhone-15-Pro-Max-3.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>7. Capture button</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Clicky upgrades may not strictly revolve around the Action button, however. The iPhone 16 Pro models are rumored to introduce an all-new Capture button, which could allow users to open the Camera app, control its zoom, take photos, and more. So, if you often use your iPhone 14 Pro to capture everyday life moments, you’ll want to grab an 16 Pro model this fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>8. Faster charging speeds</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent iPhones, including your 14 Pro, support up to 27W wired and 15W MagSafe wireless charging. Upgrading to an iPhone 16 Pro model may speed up fueling your device by increasing these rates to 40W and 20W, respectively. This would spare you the need to wait too long when topping up your phone’s juice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>9. Overhauled internal</strong> components</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 16 Pro’s battery upgrades may not be strictly limited to faster charging speeds, though. Rumors also hint at the stacked battery technology’s adoption, which could increase the energy density and help preserve the maximum capacity for a longer period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple may also incorporate a graphene thermal system, which can prevent overheating more efficiently than its copper counterpart. The iPhone 16 Pro may also encase the battery with metal to help maintain neutral temperatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>10. Higher storage capacity</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, the iPhone 16 Pro could increase the maximum storage capacity from 1TB to 2TB. This would allow you to store around double the data on your device. Given that iPhones now produce larger videos and run more complex apps, the 2TB option—coupled with the universal USB-C port and more capable A18 Pro chip— could help future-proof your device.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 14 Pro cameras\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3356w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p><br /></p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPhone 14 Pro cameras\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3356w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p><br /></p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPhone 14 Pro cameras\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3356w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iphone14-pro-cameras02-1.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p><br /></p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>iPhone 14 Pro is starting to show its age</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the iPhone 14 Pro is still relatively fresh, the rumored <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> upgrades truly highlight its shortcomings. When it first launched, we celebrated the always-on display, Dynamic Island, and 48MP main camera lens. They undoubtedly were groundbreaking coming from an iPhone 13 Pro. Now, all of these changes seem trivial when juxtaposed with an upcoming iPhone that packs Apple Intelligence, two new buttons, a superior build, a larger display, even better cameras, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since smartphone upgrades have generally been iterative in recent years, I’m quite surprised by Apple’s present advancements in this field. The company is still managing to uncover and patch iPhone shortcomings, without necessarily coming up with completely different form factors—like foldables. The iPhone is constantly evolving, but it’s still just an iPhone.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"56c358d4335f285c71f720748c111388c794d71c15f87e21e5d6dc1b1bddd264","category":"Apple"}
