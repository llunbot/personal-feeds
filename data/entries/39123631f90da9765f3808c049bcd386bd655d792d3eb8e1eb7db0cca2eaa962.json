In season two, Baba Voss (Momoa) is struggling to reunite his family while protecting them as the threat of war looms between the Kingdom of Paya and the Trivantian Republic. Despite his best efforts, his wife and sighted children are pulled to the forefront of the conflict, where they come to the attention of his estranged brother, Edo Voss (Bautista), a powerful and cunning Trivantian general, whose long-simmering hatred for his brother imperils them all even further.</blockquote>The show's second season premiere joins a busy fall season for ‌Apple TV+‌, with the second season of the hit comedy show Ted Lasso having <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/23/ted-lasso-second-season-debuts/\">premiered last week</a>, and upcoming shows, such as \"The Morning Show\" with their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/the-morning-show-season-two-trailer/\">second season premiering in September</a>.  <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/29/apple-tv-plus-see-season-two-august-27-2/\">Apple Releases Trailer for Season Two of 'See' Ahead of August 27 Premiere</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-trailer-for-season-two-of-see-ahead-of-august-27-premiere.2305894/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=aZIkqlzjIIg:Gw4Ta7RWUT8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=aZIkqlzjIIg:Gw4Ta7RWUT8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/aZIkqlzjIIg\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"39123631f90da9765f3808c049bcd386bd655d792d3eb8e1eb7db0cca2eaa962","category":"Apple"}
