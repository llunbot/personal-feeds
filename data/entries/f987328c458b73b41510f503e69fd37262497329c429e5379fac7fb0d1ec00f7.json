The November Update for Windows 10 (also known as version 21H2) has rolled out to Windows Insiders in the Release Preview channel and is also available to download as an ISO file. Microsoft expects the current build, version 19044.1288, to be the same one that is released to the general public next month.</p>\n\n<p>As milestone updates go, Windows 10 21H2 includes few user-visible improvements. One noteworthy addition is support for the WPA3 Hash-to-Element (H2E) standard, a more \"computationally efficient\" addition to WPA3 that provides protection against side-channel attacks (see the Wi-Fi Alliance PDF <a href=\"https://www.wi-fi.org/download.php?file=/sites/default/files/private/202012_Wi-Fi_Security_Roadmap_and_WPA3_Updates.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). Another is support for GPU compute support for the Windows Subsystem for Linux.</p>\n<p>Microsoft hasn't said whether the 21H2 update will be the last major servicing update for Windows 10 now that Windows 11 is here. We do know that Microsoft will be bringing Windows 11's new Microsoft Store to Windows 10 eventually, and the older OS will continue to receive updates for Microsoft Edge and (presumably) other built-in apps that get their updates through the Microsoft Store.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806460#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806460&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f987328c458b73b41510f503e69fd37262497329c429e5379fac7fb0d1ec00f7","category":"Tech"}
