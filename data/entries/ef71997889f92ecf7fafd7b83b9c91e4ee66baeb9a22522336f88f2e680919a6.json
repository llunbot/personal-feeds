While the company has not yet announced its release date, it apparently believes there will be sufficient stock ready in the country by the end of January to launch in February. Interestingly, Gurman expects Apple to make a Vision Pro-related announcement \"in the next week or so\" to \"take some of the spotlight away from CES,\" which starts on Tuesday, January 9.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn January 21, all Apple Stores in the United States will hold an unusual three-hour long meeting for all employees that will likely involve training and explanation of the sales procedure related to the device. Further training sessions are apparently planned for the subsequent days, followed by the reception of new inventory racks and backroom equipment.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman also noted that Luxshare, the Chinese assembler of the Vision Pro, held a delivery ceremony last month to mark the first official shipments of the completed product, and Apple has now purportedly filed design patents \"for every hardware and software element of the device,\" which further suggests that launch is likely to be very soon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt remains unclear whether the Vision Pro will be immediately available via online pre-order. Apple may initially only offer an online reservation for an appointment at an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a> that would involve light seal and headband fitting. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman believes that the launch of Vision Pro in other countries around the world will not \"actually be that much later\" than its release in the United States. Apple is said to be considering the United Kingdom, Canada, and China as the next markets to receive the product.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/canada/\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/luxshare/\">Luxshare</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/gurman-vision-pro-launch-imminent/\">Gurman: Vision Pro Launch 'Imminent' as Retail Stores Prepare</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-vision-pro-launch-imminent-as-retail-stores-prepare.2415695/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ef71997889f92ecf7fafd7b83b9c91e4ee66baeb9a22522336f88f2e680919a6","category":"Apple"}
