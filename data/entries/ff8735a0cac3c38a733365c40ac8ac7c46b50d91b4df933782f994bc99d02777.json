Those impacted are seeing a blank reading where the weather data should be, but tapping into the Weather app shows the expected information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome users have been able to fix the issue by opening up the Watch app on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, toggling the 24-Hour Time switch in the Clock app Settings, and waiting a few seconds before toggling it back to the original position. Others have had luck turning off Location Services on the ‌iPhone‌ temporarily and then toggling it back on after a short waiting period.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese solutions have not worked for all users, however, so there may be no fix for everyone affected until another version of watchOS comes out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>Update 7:00 p.m.</b>: A number of users who initially saw the complication working properly after updating to watchOS 10.0.2 are once again seeing broken Weather complications, suggesting any fix after the update was temporary at best.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-9/\">watchOS 9</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135\">Apple Programming</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/watchos-10-0-2-weather-complication-fix/\">watchOS 10.0.2 Fixes Weather Complication Bug on Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 [Update: No]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-0-2-fixes-weather-complication-bug-on-apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-update-no.2404909/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ff8735a0cac3c38a733365c40ac8ac7c46b50d91b4df933782f994bc99d02777","category":"Apple"}
