Thanks to organizations like the High Fives Foundation, those rides aren’t just limited to the able-bodied. This year, the High Fives Foundation has hosted more than 40 adaptive bike camps for athletes with life-changing injuries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The High Fives Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit based in Truckee, CA that focuses on “preventing life-changing injuries and providing resources and hope if they happen.” To date, they’ve improved the lives of 715 athletes and <a href=\"https://highfivesfoundation.org/programs/military-to-the-mountain/\" target=\"_blank\">veterans</a> from 46 states and Canada. Assisting the athletes with numerous adaptive sports, High Fives has five main pillars of sport that they focus on with mountain biking one of the five. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HIgh-Fives-foundation-adaptive-mountain-biking.jpg\"><img width=\"886\" height=\"592\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HIgh-Fives-foundation-adaptive-mountain-biking.jpg\" alt=\"High Fives adaptive MTB camp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HIgh-Fives-foundation-adaptive-mountain-biking.jpg 886w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HIgh-Fives-foundation-adaptive-mountain-biking-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HIgh-Fives-foundation-adaptive-mountain-biking-800x535.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HIgh-Fives-foundation-adaptive-mountain-biking-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HIgh-Fives-foundation-adaptive-mountain-biking-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HIgh-Fives-foundation-adaptive-mountain-biking-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/High Fives Foundation)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the growth of adaptive MTB trails in areas like the Reno-Tahoe area, Park City, and more, adaptive athletes have more opportunities than ever to get back out on a bike. “The amount of freedom I felt being able to rip on a bike again is truly indescribable. I no longer felt any limitations of my disability,” says Nick Harris, High Fives athlete #406. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023 alone, High Fives has hosted more than 40 adaptive bike camps at four different locations with riders tackling more than 55 different trails. “The best part of the High Fives adaptive bike camps is seeing how many different types of bikes, riding styles, and trail preferences exist. It does not matter your age, ability, or skill, fun can be had on a mountain bike trail. I love getting to witness athletes practice skills all summer long. By the end of the season, the progression is incredibly impressive,” states Dani Trujillo, HIgh Fives’ Director of Programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To stay up to date on events for 2024,<a href=\"https://highfivesfoundation.org/events/\" target=\"_blank\"> follow their calendar here</a>.
