However, 2023's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> Pro is now available for very similar approximate prices from third parties. There are at least 50 differences between the two devices, so which should you choose?\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iPhone-16e-vs-15-Pro-Buyers-Guide-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro launched in September 2023 for $999, and was discontinued upon the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> one year later. It continues to be available from third-party retailers, as well as used or refurbished, for prices around $600 to $750 depending on the configuration.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOur guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two ‌iPhone‌ models is best for you, and serves as a way to clearly see what additional features the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro brings to the table. The ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro is a much more feature-rich device than the ‌iPhone 16e‌, but the latter has a small number of advantages:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Better chip</strong>: The A18 chip is made with TSMC's latest fabrication technology and sports a higher CPU clock speed, making it more powerful and efficient than the A17 Pro.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Audio</strong>: The ‌iPhone 16e‌ features wind noise reduction and audio mix for better quality audio capture.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Thinner and lighter design</strong>: With an aluminum frame, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ is 0.45mm thinner and 20 grams lighter than the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Longer battery life</strong>: Thanks to the custom-designed Apple C1 model, the efficiency of the A18 chip, and a 21% bigger battery, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ boasts battery life that's at least three hours longer than the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro.</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs a device that's 18 months newer with a more powerful chip, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ may be more likely to be supported by the latest version of iOS for longer than the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro. It is also likely to be useable for longer through battery degradation, especially if you're comparing it to a used ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn every other respect, the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro is superior. Here is every difference between the two models:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPhone 16e‌</th>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPhone 15‌ Pro</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n

16e‌. With little to no price difference to obtain a display with ProMotion and always-on functionality, ‌MagSafe‌, ‌Dynamic Island‌, and a brighter display, many customers will easily be able to justify getting the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro over the ‌iPhone 16e‌. Perhaps most noticeably, the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro unlocks a wealth of additional camera software features and boasts multiple additional pieces of camera hardware, such as the LiDAR scanner, telephoto camera, and ultra wide camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 16e‌ still offers many of the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro's most compelling capabilities, such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> support, USB-C, the Action Button, and a 48-megapixel main camera, so the average user will miss out on few meaningful features. As a result, there are some scenarios where it is worth choosing the ‌iPhone 16e‌ over the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro. For example, if battery life or device longevity is your top priority, it remains the superior option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSimilarly, if you have only basic needs and do not care for the \"Pro\" rear camera setup or features like ProMotion and the always-on display, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ is likely the better choice. In this instance, you will still benefit from the device's generous roster of features. The ‌iPhone 16e‌ is still a very well designed and balanced device, especially for casual ‌iPhone‌ users and those coming from a much older model.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-16e-vs-iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 15 Pro Buyer's Guide: Which Is Best for $599?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-vs-iphone-15-pro-buyers-guide-which-is-best-for-599.2453958/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"626882db307407ce50517ab87e60262708052e09ed993d7c3a99ab105eddf614","category":"Apple"}
