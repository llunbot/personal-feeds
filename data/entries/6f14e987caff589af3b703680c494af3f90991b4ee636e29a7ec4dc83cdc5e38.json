By comparison, sub-6GHz 5G is generally slower than mmWave, but the signals travel further, better serving suburban and rural areas. All four iPhone 15 models support sub-6GHz 5G outside of the U.S., and sub-6GHz networks are still more common than mmWave networks in countries that have rolled out 5G.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAustralia, China, Japan, and Singapore are some of the countries outside of the U.S. that have deployed mmWave networks so far.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/everything-apple-announced-fall-2023-event/\">announced the iPhone 15 series</a> on Tuesday during its \"Wonderlust\" event. All four new models are equipped with a USB-C port and the Dynamic Island, while the Pro models have many additional features, including the A17 Pro chip, a lightweight titanium frame, a customizable Action button, 5x optical zoom on the Pro Max model, Wi-Fi 6E support, an increased 8GB of RAM, and more. The devices are available to pre-order starting this Friday at 5 a.m. Pacific Time, and will be released on Friday, September 22.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/5g/\">5G</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mmwave/\">mmWave</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/mmwave-5g-iphone-15-us-only/\">iPhone 15: mmWave 5G Remains Limited to U.S. Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-mmwave-5g-remains-limited-to-u-s-models.2401470/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6f14e987caff589af3b703680c494af3f90991b4ee636e29a7ec4dc83cdc5e38","category":"Apple"}
