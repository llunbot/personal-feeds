For today's deal roundup, we're spotlighting a <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F498089523&amp;subid1=dealmaster120721\" target=\"_blank\">new Nintendo Switch bundle</a> from Walmart that packages the base version of the mega-popular game console with a 12-month subscription to Nintendo's Switch Online service and an official carrying case at no extra cost. That comes out to roughly $40 in extras bundled into the Switch's normal going rate of $299.</p>\n<p>It's true that the bigger, bolder display on the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/\" target=\"_blank\">new Switch OLED</a> has made the standard model look a bit dated by comparison—even if the two are equal in terms of performance—and Switch Online isn't quite as essential to enjoying the Switch as similar services from Microsoft (Xbox Live Gold) and Sony (PlayStation Plus) are for their respective machines.</p>\n<p>However, if you're just jumping on the Switch bandwagon and don't want to drop an extra $50 for the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/nintendo-switch-oled-where-to-preorder/\" target=\"_blank\">still-hard-to-find</a> Switch OLED's upgraded display, this is as good a deal as we can find for the console as of this writing. (Presuming you don't want the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/nintendo-switch-lite-is-the-best-portable-system-nintendo-has-ever-made/\" target=\"_blank\">handheld-only Switch Lite</a>.) Switch Online isn't necessary, but it's still required to use the online modes of games like <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/smash-bros-ultimate-review-the-best-fighting-game-on-any-nintendo-system/\" target=\"_blank\">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> </em>and <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/mario-kart-8-is-still-great-in-its-deluxe-switch-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a></em>, and it gives access to a handful of <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/switch/online-service/nintendo-entertainment-system-nintendo-switch-online-switch/\" target=\"_blank\">classic NES</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/switch/online-service/super-nintendo-entertainment-system-nintendo-switch-online-switch/\" target=\"_blank\">SNES</a> games worth rediscovering. (A collection of N64 and Sega Genesis games are available in a pricier \"Expansion Pack\" tier that's not included in this deal, but <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/n64-collection-goes-live-on-nintendo-switch-and-its-a-me-disappointment/\" target=\"_blank\">those are something of a mess</a> at the moment.) A carrying case is generally a must for traveling with the Switch, too. While we'd definitely like to see Nintendo offer more attractive deals for the nearly five-year-old console, there's at least <em>some</em> value here for last-minute shoppers looking for a device that remains in high demand.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817911#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817911&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"03d90c7fe9735bde3683b01b720a05e72bd7018efcc32235bf976865c518ac2a","category":"Tech"}
