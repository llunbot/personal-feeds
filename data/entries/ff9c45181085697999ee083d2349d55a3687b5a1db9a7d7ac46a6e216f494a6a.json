Addressing employees at the location of the company's Starship factory, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1776669097490776563\">Musk spoke about</a> the \"high urgency\" needed to extend the \"light of consciousness\" beyond Earth. That is not because humanity's home planet is a lost cause or should not be preserved. Rather, Musk said, he does not want humanity to remain a one-planet civilization that will, inevitably, face some calamity that will end the species.</p>\n<p>All of this is fairly familiar territory for spaceflight enthusiasts—and observers of Musk. But during the last eight years he has become an increasingly controversial and polarizing figure. Based on his behavior, many people will dismiss Musk's Mars comments as those of a megalomaniac. At least in regard to spaceflight, however, that would be wrong. Musk's multiplanetary ambitions today are more credible because SpaceX has taken steps toward doing what he said the company would do.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015351#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015351&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ff9c45181085697999ee083d2349d55a3687b5a1db9a7d7ac46a6e216f494a6a","category":"Tech"}
