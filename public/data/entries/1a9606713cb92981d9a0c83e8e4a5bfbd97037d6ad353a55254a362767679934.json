As a result, Model S and Model X sales combined <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/tesla-misses-2022-q4-target-share-price-drops-further/\">represented only 5 percent</a> of Tesla's global sales in 2022.</p>\n<p>In 2022, a dual-motor all-wheel-drive Tesla Model S went for $104,990. In January, Tesla chopped about 10 percent off the price, dropping it to $94,990. Today, it's another $5,000 cheaper at $89,990.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921920#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921920&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
