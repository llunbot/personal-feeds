The “<em>best of both worlds</em>“. And it delivers the same in a much more affordable and only slightly heavier carbon frameset. Like seriously, at a claimed 990g for a medium frame, this is only 165g more than the <em>racing sport</em> Falcn RS model, and with almost exactly the same aerodynamic performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_white-frameset-detail-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_white-frameset-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ridley Falcn affordable carbon aero road bike, frameset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_white-frameset-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_white-frameset-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_white-frameset-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_white-frameset-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_white-frameset-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_white-frameset-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_white-frameset-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A switch to Essential-level hi-mod carbon for the Falcn vs. the Elite-series carbon of the Falcn RS frame is the most obvious switch. And Ridley still manages to keep the more basic Falcn frame under 1kg. But at the same time, this new Falcn swaps out the proprietary D-shaped aero seatpost of the RS for a conventional and more universal-fit round seatpost. Sure that cuts into aerodynamic gains to a tiny extent, but likely will make many riders happy with more standard seatpost options.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a

carries over the identical aero tech of the RS – think fully integrated cable routing through the headset, the diffuser fork crow to smooth airflow over the downtube, dropped seatstays, and aerodynamic tube shaping. Plus, it also gets the UDH for max drivetrain compatibility, and 34mm max tire clearance to fit bigger tires for more grip, comfort, control, and reduced rolling resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_Essential-series-hi-mod-carbon-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_Essential-series-hi-mod-carbon-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ridley Falcn affordable carbon aero road bike, essential hi-mod carbon detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_Essential-series-hi-mod-carbon-jpg.webp 1333w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_Essential-series-hi-mod-carbon-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_Essential-series-hi-mod-carbon-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_Essential-series-hi-mod-carbon-768x1152.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_Essential-series-hi-mod-carbon-1024x1536.webp 1024w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_headtube-tire-clearance-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_headtube-tire-clearance-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ridley Falcn affordable carbon aero road bike, 34mm tire clearance detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_headtube-tire-clearance-jpg.webp 1333w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_headtube-tire-clearance-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_headtube-tire-clearance-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_headtube-tire-clearance-768x1152.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_headtube-tire-clearance-1024x1536.webp 1024w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_front-end-detail-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_front-end-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ridley Falcn affordable carbon aero road bike, detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_front-end-detail-jpg.webp 1333w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_front-end-detail-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_front-end-detail-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_front-end-detail-768x1152.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ridley-Falcn-affordable-carbon-aero-road-bike_front-end-detail-1024x1536.webp 1024w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Geometry is identical as well, so the bike is race-ready.
