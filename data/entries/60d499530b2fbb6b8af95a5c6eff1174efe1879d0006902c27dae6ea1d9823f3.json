While Android phones have a toggle for emergency alert tests in Settings, iPhones do not. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iphone-emerg-test-alerts-message.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what you need to do to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/weatest_opt-in_instructions.pdf&amp;xcust=1-1-353280-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">make sure you receive the next test</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Open the Phone app</li><li>Tap Keypad</li><li>Tap the keys *5005*25371#</li><li>Tap the green call button</li><li>An alert that says “Test alerts enabled” will appear.</li><li>Tap Dismiss.</li></ul><p>If you want to disable the alerts, follow the same steps, but dial *5005*25370# instead. Government test alerts are available in <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202743&amp;xcust=1-1-353280-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">all U.S. states and Puerto Rico for all U.S. carriers</a>. </p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"60d499530b2fbb6b8af95a5c6eff1174efe1879d0006902c27dae6ea1d9823f3","category":"Apple"}
