Minnesota’s <a href=\"https://www.wildebikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wilde Bikes</a> updated its two most popular steel gravel bikes, the <a href=\"https://www.wildebikes.com/collections/bikes/products/rambler-all-arounder-gravel\" target=\"_blank\">Rambler</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wildebikes.com/collections/bikes/products/rambler-sl\" target=\"_blank\">Rambler SL</a>. They are both decked out in new colors, and importantly, are now UDH-equipped for compatibility with all drivetrain options. Each shares the same double-butted, chromoly steel frame paired with either a beautiful segmented steel fork for the Rambler, or Wilde’s Wayfinder Carbon fork for the Rambler SL.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>UDH update for the steel Wilde Rambler gravel bikes </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-rear-dropout.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-rear-dropout.webp\" alt=\"Wilde Bikes Rambler Upgrade rear dropout\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-rear-dropout.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-rear-dropout-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-rear-dropout-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-rear-dropout-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-rear-dropout-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-rear-dropout-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Wilde Bikes)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the standout news here is a new UDH dropout.

(<em>Photo/Ron Frazelle</em>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve got a few hundred miles on mine, on both road and dirt, and it’s one of the best riding bikes I’ve ridden in a long time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Some Design Notes from Jeff Frane of Wilde</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“The Rambler continues a lineage that started with the Space Horse and Space Horse Disc. I believe that even if you have a different bike for every purpose, you’ll still want to have one bike that can truly do it all. The Rambler has all the relevant mounts and features, paired with contemporary gravel geometry and a comfortable high stack riding position, to take you wherever you want to go. My own Rambler is built with 650b wheels and a vintage eight-speed triple drivetrain, and I use it for long mixed terrain rides, touring, and quite often light singletrack in the Minnesota River Bottoms and local bootleg trails. It’s never let me down and seldom felt like the wrong choice”.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-downtube-logo.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-downtube-logo.webp\" alt=\"Wilde Bikes Rambler Upgrade downtube logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-downtube-logo.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-downtube-logo-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-downtube-logo-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-downtube-logo-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-downtube-logo-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wilde-Bikes-Rambler-Upgrade-downtube-logo-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rambler Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1246\" height=\"719\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image.png 1246w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-297x171.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-120x69.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-768x443.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wilde Rambler – Retail Pricing &amp;
