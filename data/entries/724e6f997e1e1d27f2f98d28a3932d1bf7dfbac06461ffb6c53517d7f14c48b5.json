This <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK8V9LSV/\">20,000mAh Baseus Blade model is powerful, fast, and nearly half-off at Amazon today</a>. That means that instead of paying $100 for this handy battery, you can get it for $53, its lowest price yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally use the slightly thinner but less powerful Blade 2 model, which I absolutely adore, so you can be assured that the larger model performs just as well. Plus it has even better specs, with a much bigger capacity (20,000mAh as opposed to 12,000mAh) and more power (100W vs. Blade 2’s 65W). Since this power bank has enough oomph to charge your MacBook (or any other laptop), it can also juice up smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, earbuds, and even handheld consoles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two USB-C and two USB-A ports on this power bank, so you can charge multiple devices at once (though the power to each port will drop). The power bank’s display delivers information about the remaining battery, charging power for each port, and the estimated charging time left so you’ll know what you’re getting. And since it supports passthrough charging you can keep the Blade powered up while it juices up other devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Baseus Blade is a fantastic way to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK8V9LSV/\">recharge your devices on the go, especially at its sale price of just $53</a>. But it won’t stick around forever, so it’s best to hurry up and add it to your cart.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get the Baseus Blade power bank for hearly half off</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK8V9LSV/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"724e6f997e1e1d27f2f98d28a3932d1bf7dfbac06461ffb6c53517d7f14c48b5","category":"Apple"}
