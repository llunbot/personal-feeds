Inside a slightly enlarged driveside hub flange, DT fit a 40% larger diameter Star Ratchet ring so they could boost engagement to a quick 4° by increasing tooth count to 90T, without resorting to smaller, weaker, more failure-prone engagement teeth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>DT Swiss sent up one of the first 240 DEG hubs to use and abuse, to see how it fared long-term. And we can comfortably say, that if you are looking for proven DT Swiss durability but feel like you need faster engagement, then 240 DEG is for you!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>DT Swiss 240 Ratchet DEG hub speeds up engagement</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_90T-vs-35T-vs-18T-ratchets.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_90T-vs-35T-vs-18T-ratchets.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 240 Ratchet DEG fast engagement MTB hub, 90T vs. 36T vs. 18T ratchets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_90T-vs-35T-vs-18T-ratchets.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_90T-vs-35T-vs-18T-ratchets-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_90T-vs-35T-vs-18T-ratchets-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_90T-vs-35T-vs-18T-ratchets-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_90T-vs-35T-vs-18T-ratchets-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_90T-vs-35T-vs-18T-ratchets-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The premise is simple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many more mountain bike hub makers have in recent years developed faster-engaging hubs. And more mountain bikers have decided they want more POEs (points of engagement) in their hubs. DT Swiss had generally refrained from more. Because with their Ratchet system it meant smaller teeth, which negated much of the positive full engagement and bulletproof durability that comes from their iconic Star Ratchet design in the first place (vs. the more flimsy pawl solution). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But with Hope <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hope-pro-5-hubs-pick-up-faster-with-108-poes-reduced-drag/\" target=\"_blank\">Pro 5</a> now offering 108 POEs, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/qvist-factory-tour-unique-double-ratchet-hubs-made-in-germany-pre-order-now/\" target=\"_blank\">Qvist</a> 120 POE, Zipp <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/zipp-3zero-moto-wheels-get-updated-with-zm2-hubs-featuring-12-pawls-132-poe/\" target=\"_blank\">3Zero Moto</a> 132 POE, Project 321 <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-project-321-hubs-get-slick-centerlock-plus-6-bolt-design-tougher-axles/\" target=\"_blank\">G3</a> 288 POEs, and Industry Nine <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/industry-nine-hydra-hubs-offer-mythical-performance-w-690-points-of-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\">Hydra</a> a whopping 690 POE through various freehub systems (to name just a few)… DT Swiss felt they kinda needed to catch up.

Of course, that means it’s not a simple upgrade to existing hubs, but needed an all-new hub shell design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new hardened steel DT 240 DEG ratchet rings are 10mm larger in diameter than their original star ratchet. That means that the 90-teeth on the Ratchet DEG ring are the same size as the 54-teeth on the upgrade Ratchet &amp; Ratchet EXP rings. That means you get the same strength and durability, but with much faster engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-DEG-hub-left-vs-240-Ratchet-EXP-hub-right.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1850\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-DEG-hub-left-vs-240-Ratchet-EXP-hub-right.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 240 Ratchet DEG fast engagement MTB hub, construction cutaway comparison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-DEG-hub-left-vs-240-Ratchet-EXP-hub-right.jpg 1850w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-DEG-hub-left-vs-240-Ratchet-EXP-hub-right-297x144.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-DEG-hub-left-vs-240-Ratchet-EXP-hub-right-1536x747.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-DEG-hub-left-vs-240-Ratchet-EXP-hub-right-120x58.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-DEG-hub-left-vs-240-Ratchet-EXP-hub-right-768x374.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>DT 240 DEG (l) vs. 240 EXP (r)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A side benefit of the new, bigger diameter Ratchet DEG rings is that the 240 DEG hub has slightly wider bearing spacing and the hubs are easier to service. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_bearing-spacing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_bearing-spacing.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 240 Ratchet DEG fast engagement MTB hub, bearing spacing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_bearing-spacing.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_bearing-spacing-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_bearing-spacing-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_bearing-spacing-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_bearing-spacing-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_bearing-spacing-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Graphic/DT Swiss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The wider spacing works because the outer driveside bearing now fits inside of the ratchet.

DT says a new 240 DEG 90T weighs 270g vs. a comparable standard flange 240 EXP 36T hub at 225g – just a 45g weight penalty for almost 3x as fast engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>But wait, do I actually need faster engagement?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_in-a-wheel-in-a-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_in-a-wheel-in-a-bike.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 240 Ratchet DEG fast engagement MTB hub, in a bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_in-a-wheel-in-a-bike.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_in-a-wheel-in-a-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_in-a-wheel-in-a-bike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_in-a-wheel-in-a-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_in-a-wheel-in-a-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_in-a-wheel-in-a-bike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_in-a-wheel-in-a-bike-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious first qualifier here is… do you really need or even want faster hub engagement? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, road and gravel riders are perfectly well served with 36T engagement. More POEs means faster response from coating to putting down power to the rear wheel, but a bit more drag. Really, you only want or need more POEs if you are riding more technical terrain or prefer a more connected feel in your drivetrain, to have your bike jump the instant you stomp on the pedals. But of course, faster engagement also does some wacky feedback with full-suspension bikes (especially big travel &amp; high-pivot bikes) to the point that Ochain exists to put some slack back in your drivetrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_riding-rocks.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_riding-rocks.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 240 Ratchet DEG fast engagement MTB hub, rock all-mountain riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_riding-rocks.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_riding-rocks-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_riding-rocks-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_riding-rocks-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_riding-rocks-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_riding-rocks-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_riding-rocks-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I can say that personally, I have gotten used to 36T/10° engagement as the performance standard. And I am happy with that. But I ride a lot of steep and rocky technical trails where I need to often quickly ratchet on the pedals to get up over an obstacle or through an especially tight section of trail. In those instances, the 90T/4° DT Swiss 240 DEG hub was a big functional improvement. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Riding with the DT Swiss 240 Ratchet DEG hub</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_wheel-up-close.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_wheel-up-close.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 240 Ratchet DEG fast engagement MTB hub, dirty wheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_wheel-up-close.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_wheel-up-close-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_wheel-up-close-1536x853.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_wheel-up-close-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_wheel-up-close-768x427.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We rode the new DT Swiss 240 Ratchet DEG hub hard, built into a 30mm internal XM481 alloy rim with 32 spokes for more than half a year, starting in the middle of winter.

The 36T/10° movement translates to 30mm at the pedal vs. just 12mm for the DEG 90T/4° movement. It’s enough difference that a bike instantly felt more responsive when we swapped the wheels over to the 240 DEG. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, I liked the 240 DEG hub’s engagement a lot. But I don’t feel the need to ditch my old wheels just because of their slightly slower hubs. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_GT-Sensor-ST-trail-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_GT-Sensor-ST-trail-bike.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 240 Ratchet DEG fast engagement MTB hub, in GT Sensor ST trail bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_GT-Sensor-ST-trail-bike.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_GT-Sensor-ST-trail-bike-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_GT-Sensor-ST-trail-bike-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_GT-Sensor-ST-trail-bike-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_GT-Sensor-ST-trail-bike-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_GT-Sensor-ST-trail-bike-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the next mountain bike wheelset that I build WILL for sure have a DT 240 DEG hub in it. I don’t ride any bikes with real pedal kickback issues, so the faster hubs with proven DT Swiss reliability will be a welcome addition to my MTB stable. And in the meantime, I think I’ll look at upgrading my current DT Swiss Ratchet &amp; Ratchet EXP mountain bike hubs to their 54T/6.6̅° ratchets which should split the difference between the 90T &amp; 36T ratchets I have been riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DT Swiss Ratchet DEG – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_rear-hub.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_rear-hub.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 240 Ratchet DEG fast engagement MTB hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_rear-hub.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_rear-hub-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_rear-hub-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_rear-hub-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DT-Swiss-240-Ratchet-DEG-hub-review_90T-MTB-fast-engagement_rear-hub-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, DT Swiss is only making the new 90T Ratchet DEG faster engagement system available in a single hub line – the $500 / 377€ 240 DEG rear hub. Their thinking is that the weight weenies who buy 180 hubs don’t want the weight penalty, and the 350 &amp; 370 buyers are looking more for lower prices. You can only get the DT 240 DEG hubs in 6-bolt classic flange for J-bend spokes (28- or 32-hole drilling) and MTB spacing – 12mm thru-axle Boost or Super Boost. The 240 DEG does of course require its own special freehub bodies, but those come in Shimano MicroSpline or SRAM XD. Sorry no HG option, so limited compatibility beyond the latest 12-speed MTB groups from Shimano &amp; SRAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are already a few new pre-built premium carbon mountain bike wheels that feature new 90T engagement hubs too. The latest DT Swiss carbon 1200-series wheels offer two options that feature Ratchet DEG engagement inside special straight-pull 180 DEG hubs. For $2912 / 2500€ you can get a set of 1540g XMC1200 all-mountain wheels or 1801g EXC1200 enduro wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the slightly more affordable carbon XMC &amp; EXC 1501-series offer a bit heavier builds with special straight-pull 240 DEG hubs for almost $900/800€ less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.dtswiss.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DTSwiss.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-dt-swiss-240-deg-hub-boosts-engagement-with-oversized-90t-ratchet-ring/\">Review: DT Swiss 240 DEG Hub Boosts Engagement with Oversized 90T Ratchet Ring</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"a72afc93f0a4a68d60b7656ecb22c7e753095136c01d7e6d4080031b60ff907e","category":"Cycling"}
