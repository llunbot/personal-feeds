The app is designed to alleviate fears from experts worried that ‌AirTags‌ can be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/05/airtags-anti-stalking-measures-not-sufficient/\">used maliciously to track</a> the location of individuals. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/airtag-found-moving-with-you/\">previously introduced several safety features</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/03/apple-airtags-anti-stalking-measures/\">an alert </a>that will let an ‌iPhone‌ user know if an AirTag that does not belong to them is following them. There was no such protection for Android users prior to the introduction of the Tracker Detect app, which Apple said it was working on back in June.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAn <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227\">Apple Support document</a> on the feature says that if the app detects an AirTag or Find My-compatible item tracker nearby for at least 10 minutes, a sound can be used to help locate it. Conducting a scan will reveal any nearby ‌AirTags‌, and after offering up a tool to play a sound to locate the AirTag, Apple will offer information on how to disable it by removing the battery.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/android-tracker-detect-app/\">Apple Releases 'Tracker Detect' App to Prevent Android Users From Being Tracked by AirTags</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-tracker-detect-app-to-prevent-android-users-from-being-tracked-by-airtags.2327341/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=auryFVEsFvU:ntHMx8l0JL4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=auryFVEsFvU:ntHMx8l0JL4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e074f291725d7ae91acb4ab0ef7de1d73f758db19f9c81ccff342edea1c87215","category":"Apple"}
