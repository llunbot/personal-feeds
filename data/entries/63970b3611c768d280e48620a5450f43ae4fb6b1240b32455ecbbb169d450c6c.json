Method Financial’s authentication technology allows instant access to a consumer’s full liability portfolio using just personal information and consent, eliminating the need for usernames and passwords.</p>\n\n<p>With just a few lines of code, Method’s APIs enable real-time, read-write, and frictionless access to all consumer liability data with integrated payment rails. Method leverages integrations with over 15,000 financial institutions to stream up-to-date, high-fidelity data from users’ accounts and to facilitate payment to them. </p>\n\n<p>Method has helped 3 million consumers connect over 24 million liability accounts at companies like Aven, SoFi, Figure, and Happy Money, saving borrowers millions in interest and providing access to billions of dollars in personalized loans.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/29/method\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"63970b3611c768d280e48620a5450f43ae4fb6b1240b32455ecbbb169d450c6c","category":"Tech"}
