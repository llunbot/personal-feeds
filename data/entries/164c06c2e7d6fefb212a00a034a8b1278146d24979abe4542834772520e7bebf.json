The latest news has to do with Google Shopping's integration with Google Search. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/11/google-refutes-eu-antitrust-charges-on-comparison-shopping-adsense/\">In 2017,</a> the EU ruled that Google Shopping's integration with Search was a violation of antitrust laws. Today, Google <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-10/google-loses-eu-court-fight-over-2-8-billion-antitrust-fine?srnd=technology-vp\">lost its appeal</a>, and the court held up the €2.4 billion ($2.8 billion) fine. Google can still appeal the ruling one more time, but this time, the company would go before the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the highest court in the EU.</p>\n<p>As in many other antitrust lawsuits that Google is facing around the world, EU regulators took issue with Google artificially promoting its own services over the competition on the search results page. Google Maps, Google Shopping, and Google Flights all automatically get premium spots above the organic search results.</p>\n<p>Google's verticals provide Google Search results with rich, often helpful content that goes above and beyond the standard \"10 blue links\" interface, but there's no reason non-Google services can't also provide this data. Google <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/google-sends-anti-regulation-propaganda-to-small-businesses-using-google-maps/\">often says</a> that regulation will remove these rich results from search, but it has a whole \"<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/intro-structured-data\">structured data format</a>\" that allows for rich results from non-Google sites, so the claim doesn't add up. Google <a href=\"https://www.localvisibilitysystem.com/2015/06/29/facebook-reviews-now-get-you-rich-snippet-review-stars-in-the-local-search-results/\">regularly shows</a> rich-result content from third-party sites today; it's just not pinned to the top of the page.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811821#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811821&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"164c06c2e7d6fefb212a00a034a8b1278146d24979abe4542834772520e7bebf","category":"Tech"}
