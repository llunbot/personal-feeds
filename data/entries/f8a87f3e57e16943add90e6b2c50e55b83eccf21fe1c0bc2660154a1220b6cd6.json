As @analyst941 notes, this could be achieved by daisy-chaining displays, but it could also indicate that the larger iPad features multiple Thunderbolt ports instead of just one.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA 14.1-inch ‌iPad would be the largest iPad to date, beating the current 12.9-inch iPad Pro size. The leaker suggests that Apple could adopt a new name for the larger forthcoming device(s) to differentiate them from the current crop, such as \"iPad Ultra\" or iPad Studio,\" although this specific claim appears to be based on speculation rather than hard evidence.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is believed to have been working on iPads with even larger displays since mid-2021, but rumors have been conflicted about when the first models will arrive and in what size.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em> has repeatedly discussed Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/27/apple-exploring-larger-ipads/\">interest in bigger iPads</a>, while reliable display analyst Ross Young at one stage reported that a 14.1-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ with a mini-LED display was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/09/14-inch-ipad-pro-with-mini-led-display-rumored/\">slated to launch in the first quarter of 2023</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever in December 2022, Young reversed his prediction and said that Apple is no longer planning to launch the new 14.1-inch form factor. Young suggested that the device was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/14-1-inch-ipad-for-2023/\">canceled entirely or significantly delayed</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSeparately, in October 2022, <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/26/16-inch-ipad-next-year-report/\">reported</a> that Apple is developing a 16-inch iPad that it hopes to release in the fourth quarter of 2023. Despite that, larger ‌iPad‌ models were missing from ‌Mark Gurman‌'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/08/airpods-apple-watch-ipad-apple-tv-2023/\">Apple device roadmap for this year</a>, saying that there will be no significant ‌iPad‌ hardware updates in 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe anonymous source behind today's rumor leaked accurate information about the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/31/iphone-14-pro-camera-cutout-indicators/\">iPhone 14 Pro's Dynamic Island on the <em>MacRumors</em> Forums</a> before the device was announced last year. However, they do not have a long-term track record with rumors yet, so there is no guarantee the latest information they shared will prove to be accurate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to preview iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 during the WWDC 2023 keynote on June 5.
