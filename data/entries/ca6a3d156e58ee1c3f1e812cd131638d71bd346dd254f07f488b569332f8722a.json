A blistering final two laps from the Italians – Simone Consonni, Filippo Ganna, Francesco Lamon, and Jonathan Milan – put them back in front inside the final 125 metres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Italians completed their effort with a time of 3:42.032, three-tenths of a second faster than the world record it had set a day earlier in the first round of competition. Denmark’s time of 3:42.198 was also faster than the old world record.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-7.28.13-pm-1340x1281.jpg\" /><figcaption>A breakdown of the super-close men’s team pursuit final.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Italy’s was the sixth team pursuit world record that has been broken on the super-fast Izu Velodrome this week, after the German women set three new records, Great Britain’s women set one, and after the Italian men’s world record from the first round.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moments before the gold-medal race, Australia and New Zealand faced off for the bronze medal. The two teams were neck and neck before a touch of wheels at the back of the Kiwi train threw New Zealand’s medal hopes into disarray.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia’s bronze medal will come as some comfort after its team pursuit campaign was derailed in qualifying when <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/australians-handlebar-snaps-during-olympic-team-pursuit-qualifying/\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Porter’s handlebar snapped mid-race</a>.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/italy-takes-team-pursuit-gold-with-another-world-record/\">Read More</a>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"ca6a3d156e58ee1c3f1e812cd131638d71bd346dd254f07f488b569332f8722a","category":"Cycling"}
