major changes to its Kickr indoor training offering with the release of the new Kickr Move direct-drive turbo trainer and Kickr Bike Shift stationary bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kickr Move builds on the Kickr V6 with a new integrated movement track fitted directly into the base which Wahoo says allows eight inches of fore-aft movement to improve comfort and create a more realistic ride feel.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n

new Kickr Move aims to provide a more realistic ride feel, with the eight inches of fore-aft movement claiming to accommodate the natural flow riders have when training outdoors. Wahoo says less than eight inches found riders maxing out the movement too often, and it wanted to provide enough of a range of movement while maintaining a reasonable weight and price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The movement has a ‘gravity track’ at either end of the range, which purports to provide a slight increase in resistance when at the extremes, to help prevent riders jolting when they reach the movement limits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also a lockout lever that can be activated by foot while still on the bike, which returns the bike to a static state. For those with a Wahoo Climb unit, an adapter can be purchased to make it compatible with the Kickr Move. The adapter fits to the base of the Climb, allowing it to rock and accommodate the movement from the Kickr Move.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-MOVE_WFBKTR123_PRODUCT_DETAILS_02614-01-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Wahoo Kickr Move and Bike Shift\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-MOVE_WFBKTR123_PRODUCT_DETAILS_02614-01-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-MOVE_WFBKTR123_PRODUCT_DETAILS_02614-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-MOVE_WFBKTR123_PRODUCT_DETAILS_02614-01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-MOVE_WFBKTR123_PRODUCT_DETAILS_02614-01-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-MOVE_WFBKTR123_PRODUCT_DETAILS_02614-01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-MOVE_WFBKTR123_PRODUCT_DETAILS_02614-01-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-MOVE_WFBKTR123_PRODUCT_DETAILS_02614-01-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-MOVE_WFBKTR123_PRODUCT_DETAILS_02614-01-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-MOVE_WFBKTR123_PRODUCT_DETAILS_02614-01-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-MOVE_WFBKTR123_PRODUCT_DETAILS_02614-01-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Wahoo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the trainer remains relatively unchanged from the Kickr V6, with the same max power and power accuracy claims – 2,200 watts and +/- 1% – as well as existing training features such as ERG Easy Ramp and race mode connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The movement track does add a hefty chunk to the price however, now £1,399.99 in comparison to the V6’s £1,099.99, as well as to the actual weight – it’s gained 7kg for a claimed weight of 29kg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kickr Move uses a new ‘out-of-box experience’ which Wahoo says focusses on tailored video content and online information to help riders get the most out of their smart trainer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shifting focus</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT_WFBIKE2_PRODUCT_ECOSYSTEM_WIDE_02531-01-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Wahoo Kickr Move and Bike Shift\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT_WFBIKE2_PRODUCT_ECOSYSTEM_WIDE_02531-01-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT_WFBIKE2_PRODUCT_ECOSYSTEM_WIDE_02531-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT_WFBIKE2_PRODUCT_ECOSYSTEM_WIDE_02531-01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT_WFBIKE2_PRODUCT_ECOSYSTEM_WIDE_02531-01-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT_WFBIKE2_PRODUCT_ECOSYSTEM_WIDE_02531-01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT_WFBIKE2_PRODUCT_ECOSYSTEM_WIDE_02531-01-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT_WFBIKE2_PRODUCT_ECOSYSTEM_WIDE_02531-01-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT_WFBIKE2_PRODUCT_ECOSYSTEM_WIDE_02531-01-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT_WFBIKE2_PRODUCT_ECOSYSTEM_WIDE_02531-01-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/Wahoo_KICKR-BIKE-SHIFT_WFBIKE2_PRODUCT_ECOSYSTEM_WIDE_02531-01-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Wahoo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Kickr Move is all about improving on the existing offering, the Kickr Bike Shift’s goal is to provide stationary bike tech at a (slightly) more affordable price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kickr Bike Shift is made from steel rather than aluminium to reduce costs, as well as allow for a narrower top tube to provide better fit options for smaller riders.
