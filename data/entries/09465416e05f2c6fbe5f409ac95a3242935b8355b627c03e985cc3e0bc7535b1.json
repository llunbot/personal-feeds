The Apple Silicon MacBook Pro designs are both thicker and heavier than the Intel-era MacBook Pros they replaced. The MacBook Air gave up its distinctive taper. Even the iPhone 15 Pro was a shade thicker than its predecessor.</p>\n<p>But Apple is apparently planning to return to emphasizing thinness in its devices, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-16/when-is-apple-intelligence-coming-some-ai-features-won-t-arrive-until-2025-lxhjh86w\">according to reporting from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman</a> (in a piece that is otherwise mostly about Apple's phased rollout of the AI-powered features it announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference last week).</p>\n<p>Gurman's sources say that Apple is planning \"a significantly skinnier iPhone in time for the iPhone 17 line in 2025,\" which presumably means that we can expect the iPhone 16 to continue in the same vein as current iPhone 15 models. The Apple Watch and MacBook Pro are also apparently on the list of devices Apple is trying to make thinner.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031910#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031910&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"09465416e05f2c6fbe5f409ac95a3242935b8355b627c03e985cc3e0bc7535b1","category":"Tech"}
