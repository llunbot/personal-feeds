The cables are available in 3-meter (approximately 10 feet) and 4.5-meter (15 feet) lengths, priced at $98.99 and $129.99 respectively.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/owc-usb4-long-cable.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nBoth cables support data transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps, matching the maximum throughput of Thunderbolt 4. The 3-meter version delivers up to 240W of power delivery, while the 4.5-meter cable supports up to 60W charging capabilities, according to OWC.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIntel only guarantees Thunderbolt 4 performance over cables up to 2 meters in length, so while these cables aren't officially certified as Thunderbolt 4, they do maintain compatibility with Thunderbolt 3 and 4 devices, including docks and hubs. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOWC says it achieves the extended length capabilities through fiber optic technology, which provides better immunity to electromagnetic interference compared to traditional copper cables. The technology is reminiscent of the Light Peak project that Intel and Apple initially developed before settling on copper-based Thunderbolt solutions. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe release presents a more affordable alternative to <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW5H3AM/A/thunderbolt-4-usbhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW5H3AM/A/thunderbolt-4-usb\">Apple's 3-meter Thunderbolt 4 cable</a>, which is priced at $159. Like Apple's offering, the OWC cables feature a braided nylon covering for durability and flexibility.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlso from today, OWC's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/owc-thunderbolt-5-hub-unveiled/\">previously announced</a> Thunderbolt 5 hub is <a href=\"https://www.owc.com/solutions/thunderbolt-5-hub\">now available to purchase</a>, having been on pre-order since November. Priced at $189.99, OWC's hub is one of the first accessories to support Intel's latest Thunderbolt standard, and offers Thunderbolt 5 compatibility with Apple's latest Mac mini and MacBook Pro Models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips. The new cables and hub are available to order directly from the <a href=\"https://www.owc.com\">OWC website</a>. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/owc/\">OWC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thunderbolt-5/\">Thunderbolt 5</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/owc-debuts-40gbps-usb4-cables-up-to-15-feet-long/\">OWC Debuts 40Gbps USB4 Cables Up to 15 Feet Long</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/owc-debuts-40gbps-usb4-cables-up-to-15-feet-long.2446782/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bc9c8ef7b274ed5820bc131c1c157e28f74b8060ef66836f753124f98154434f","category":"Apple"}
