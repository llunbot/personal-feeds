{"title":"How to Watch Apple's iPhone 13 Event on September 14, 2021","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-iphone-13-event-september-14-2021/","date":1631440800000,"content":"Apple is hosting an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/apple-september-14-event/\">online streaming media event</a> for the public and press on September 14, 2021 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Apple is expected to announce its new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> lineup alongside an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-7/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a>, and potentially other products during the event, dubbed \"California Streaming.\" Here's how you can watch it and when, wherever you are in the world.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/apple-event-september-14.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are multiple ways to watch the September 14 event, with details listed below. We've also included a useful guide on when the event will take place in your particular time zone.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple Events Website</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nWith the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">Apple Events website</a>, you can watch the event live on a Mac, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>‌, PC, or any other device with a web browser. The Apple Events website works in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and other main browsers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nJust navigate to <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">www.apple.com/apple-events/</a> using a web browser at the appropriate time to watch. You can visit the site now to add an event reminder to your calendar.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>YouTube</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple also plans to stream the event live on YouTube, which is perhaps the easiest and most efficient way to watch because the YouTube live stream can be viewed on every platform where YouTube is available, which is pretty much all platforms, from smartphones and tablets to consoles and smart TVs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nApple has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvGOlAkLSLw\">posted a placeholder for the September 14 event</a> on YouTube, and you can visit it now to set an event reminder through YouTube.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple TV App</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple used to have a dedicated Apple Events app on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, but ahead of WWDC 2020, it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/18/events-app-apple-tv-app-wwdc/\">folded into the Apple TV app</a>. On event day, there will be a prominent ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ app section dedicated to the live stream, which can be watched on any device where the ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ app is available.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/appleevents1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThis includes the ‌‌Apple TV‌‌, iPhones, iPads, Macs, and some smart TVs. If you have an ‌‌Apple TV‌‌, the ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ app is one of the best ways to watch the event live. Apple hasn't updated the ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ app with the new event as of yet, but it should be added soon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>When to Watch the Apple Event</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple's event will take place at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, like most Apple events.
