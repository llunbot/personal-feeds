The all-new Viral Derive is designed for singletrack touring, bikepacking racing, backcountry rides, and all-country riding, made for everything from a rigid fork to a 120mm travel front fork.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Derive-SS-Bridge-Detail.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Derive-SS-Bridge-Detail.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Derive-SS-Bridge-Detail.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/10/Derive-SS-Bridge-Detail.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><span>There are multiple mounting points for fenders and racks and mounting for three water bottles of all sizes, including a 3-pack mount on the underside of the downtube and a top tube ‘gas tank’ mount. It comes standard with the new <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/pinion-smart-shift-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinion Smart Shift electronic shifting system</a>, with wiring and battery internally hidden and protected. It is still compatible with the mechanical gearbox if you prefer no electronics.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Viral-Derive-Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Viral-Derive-Review-8.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Viral-Derive-Review-8.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Viral-Derive-Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Viral-Derive-Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Viral-Derive-Review-10.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Viral-Derive-Review-10.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/05/Viral-Derive-Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/viral-derive-review/\" target=\"_blank\">original Derive</a> held its own on multiple singletrack overnighters, both loaded down and unloaded!</em></p>\n<p>Check out more on the all-new Derive at <a href=\"https://viral.bike/shop/p/viralderive\" target=\"_blank\">Viral Bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2025-viral-derive-29er/\">The All-New 2025 Viral Derive is 29er Only and Has Internal Dynamo Routing</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"3a22a3bf1f906229c6156041fb908609b62c4cdbca7c79e7b0110e95cef3c8db","category":"Cycling"}
