But it is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-mail-features-missing-mac-ipad/\">a weirdly glaring omission</a>. <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-intelligence-is-available-today-on-iphone-ipad-and-mac/\">Apple itself started promoting screenshots</a> of the Apple Intelligence inbox categorization in Mail for Mac back in October, when the .1 OS updates shipped with the initial round of Apple Intelligence features.</p>\n\n<p>I am reliably informed that the new Mail categorization features are coming soon to iPad and Mac, which I suspect means in the .3 updates. But the first .3 betas aren’t out yet.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/13/whats-new-in-macos-15-2-sequoia\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c92a4808bb2d3bf4b2580a5b181ac6f526a8b4eed6211945970465ece832f370","category":"Tech"}
