Google has moved with uncharacteristic speed to release Gemini 2.5 Pro (Experimental) for free users, too. The next time you check in with Gemini, you can access most of the new AI's features without a Gemini Advanced subscription.</p>\n<p>The Gemini 2.5 branch will eventually replace 2.0, which was only released in late 2024. It supports simulated reasoning, as all Google's models will in the future. This approach to producing an output can avoid some of the common mistakes that AI models have made in the past. We've also been impressed with Gemini 2.5's vibe, which has landed it at the top of the <a href=\"https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard\">LMSYS Chatbot arena leaderboard</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1906131622736679332\">Google says</a> Gemini 2.5 Pro (Experimental) is ready and waiting for free users to try on the web. Simply select the model from the drop-down menu and enter your prompt to watch the \"thinking\" happen. The model will roll out to the mobile app for free users soon.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/googles-new-experimental-gemini-2-5-model-rolls-out-to-free-users/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/googles-new-experimental-gemini-2-5-model-rolls-out-to-free-users/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"351fd358e859ab41bbfbda2b99ad6f932b429e47c97d8e9e599cde618d29cd75","category":"Tech"}
