That’s true whether you’re comparing this iPad mini to the last one, or if you’re comparing it to the other iPads Apple sells.</p>\n<p>The mini almost always seems to get the short end of the stick on the rare occasions when it’s updated at all. It has been saddled with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/09/ipad-mini-4-review-a-lighter-faster-tablet-with-a-better-screen/\" target=\"_blank\">older, slower processors</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/11/review-apples-retina-ipad-mini-is-the-small-tablet-we-wanted-a-year-ago/\" target=\"_blank\">inferior screens</a> or dated designs. This iPad mini, on the other hand, has a fully modern design and a cutting-edge Apple A15 chip in it. It’s a fantastic tablet—<em>if</em> you’re the kind of person who is already ride-or-die for the iPad mini.</p>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                <h3>Apple iPad mini (2021)                                                </h3>\n                        <div>\n                                                            <ul><li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/1305166/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-mini&amp;subid1=ArsiPadMini2021\" target=\"_blank\">From $499 at Apple</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                        \n                                    <li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://amzn.to/39tjJSM\" target=\"_blank\">From $499 at Amazon</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                                                    </ul></div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <div>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<p>That’s a big if, because as great as the mini is, its position in Apple’s lineup remains awkward.
