One scene had 70 angles and takes to choose from, so he used a single multicam clip to play nine angles simultaneously to choose the most ideal shots. There was around 83TB of footage to comb through.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRichman primarily uses an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, and because he works remotely, he connects to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> that runs professional video editing software Avid. When he's on the go, he's still able to work on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> thanks to the syncing between Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe video that Apple shared has a lot more insight into the editing process, along with some of the concepts and ideas that the team took into account when working on Severance season two.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe second season of the show wrapped up last week, and the entire season is now available for streaming on ‌Apple TV‌+.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/apple-behind-the-mac-severance/\">Apple's 'Behind the Mac' Video Dives Into Severance Season 2 Editing Techniques</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-behind-the-mac-video-dives-into-severance-season-2-editing-techniques.2454094/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"82c034f0aa69ef2dc704bfbffa88016dbcf7eea73a128da8114d230cdbcf136c","category":"Apple"}
