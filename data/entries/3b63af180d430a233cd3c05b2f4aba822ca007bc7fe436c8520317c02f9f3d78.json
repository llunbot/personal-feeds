While we are pretty good at making the non-biological parts work, we’ve always had a problem with keeping the organic components alive and well. This is why machines driven by biological muscles have always been rather small and simple—up to a couple centimeters long and typically with only a single actuating joint.</p>\n<p>“Scaling up biohybrid robots has been difficult due to the weak contractile force of lab-grown muscles, the risk of necrosis in thick muscle tissues, and the challenge of integrating biological actuators with artificial structures,” says Shoji Takeuchi, a professor at the Tokyo University, Japan. Takeuchi led a research team that built a full-size, 18 centimeter-long biohybrid human-like hand with all five fingers driven by lab-grown human muscles.</p>\n<h2>Keeping the muscles alive</h2>\n<p>Out of all the roadblocks that keep us from building large-scale biohybrid robots, necrosis has probably been the most difficult to overcome. Growing muscles in a lab usually means a liquid medium to supply nutrients and oxygen to muscle cells seeded on petri dishes or applied to gel scaffoldings. Since these cultured muscles are small and ideally flat, nutrients and oxygen from the medium can easily reach every cell in the growing culture.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/a-biohybrid-robotic-hand-built-using-real-human-muscle-cells/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/a-biohybrid-robotic-hand-built-using-real-human-muscle-cells/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3b63af180d430a233cd3c05b2f4aba822ca007bc7fe436c8520317c02f9f3d78","category":"Tech"}
