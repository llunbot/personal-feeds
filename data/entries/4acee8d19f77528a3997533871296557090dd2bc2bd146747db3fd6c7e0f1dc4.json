These features have alerted many people to conditions like atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea, and even cancer, allowing them to seek medical attention earlier than they would have otherwise.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn several interviews over the years, Cook has said that Apple's greatest contribution to the world <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/08/cook-apple-health-most-important-contribution-to-mankind/\">will be in the health space</a>, and the Apple Watch is a testament to that. Over the next decade, we can expect even more health features on the Apple Watch, such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/apple-watch-blood-pressure-feature-snags/\">blood pressure measuring</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-watch-glucose-monitoring-feature/\">potentially even non-invasive blood glucose monitoring</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is not marketing hype to say that the Apple Watch has made a profound impact on humankind, and it is exciting to see what the next decade holds.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/apple-watch-launched-10-years-ago-today/\">Apple Watch Launched 10 Years Ago Today</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-launched-10-years-ago-today.2455882/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4acee8d19f77528a3997533871296557090dd2bc2bd146747db3fd6c7e0f1dc4","category":"Apple"}
