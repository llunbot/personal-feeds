If these measurements are accurate, the bezels would be around 10% to 15% thinner than on previous iPad Pro models released between 2018 and 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther key new features rumored for the next iPad Pro models include Apple's latest M3 chip, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/\">thinner enclosure</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/\">landscape front camera</a>, rear camera design tweaks, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/\">potentially MagSafe wireless charging</a>. New accessories are also expected, including an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/\">updated Magic Keyboard</a> with a partly-aluminum enclosure and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/new-apple-pencil-to-launch-this-month/\">updated Apple Pencil</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Instant Digital\" has a mostly-accurate track record with Apple rumors over the past year.
