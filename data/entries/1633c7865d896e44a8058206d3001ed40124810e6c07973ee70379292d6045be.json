How can a shorter saddle be more comfortable than a longer bike seat?</p>\n<p>Alex Locatelli, product manager at Fizik, bike fitter Dan Smith from UK Bike Fit, and Jeff Schneider, global head of product and marketing at Cadex and Giant group, have helped us answer some common questions about short saddles.</p>\n<h3>What is a short-nose saddle?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Power Arc Pro\" title=\"Specialized Power Arc Pro\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> In 2015, the Power saddle stood out with its cut-out, wide wings and stubby front.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James Huang / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A short-nose saddle is shorter and wider than a conventional saddle, and can make riding in an aggressive, aerodynamic position more comfortable.</p>\n<p>A typical short-nose saddle is about 245mm long, 30mm shorter than a standard saddle.</p>\n<p>Unlike a conventional saddle with a narrow, pointy tip, the front of a short-nose saddle is usually square.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Fizik Tempo Argo R3 saddle\" title=\"Fizik Tempo Argo R3 saddle\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cut-outs or pressure-relief channels are common on short saddles.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Because you can comfortably adopt an aggressive position, short-nose saddles were common on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/time-trial-bikes/\">time trial bikes</a> long before their adoption on the road.</p>\n<p>Short-nose saddles often but not always have a cut-out.
