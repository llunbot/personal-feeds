Intel-based Mac mini instances were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/01/amazon-aws-mac-instances/\">already available since last year</a>, but M1 models will provide improved performance, allowing developers building apps for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV to benefit from faster builds.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the announcement:<blockquote>If you are a Mac developer and re-architecting your apps to natively support Macs with Apple silicon, you may now build and test your apps and take advantage of all the benefits of AWS. Developers building for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV will also benefit from faster builds. EC2 M1 Mac instances deliver up to 60% better price performance over the x86-based EC2 Mac instances for iPhone and Mac app build workloads.</blockquote>More details are available <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fblogs%2Faws%2Fuse-amazon-ec2-m1-mac-instances-to-build-test-macos-ios-ipados-tvos-and-watchos-apps%2F\">on the Amazon Web Services website</a> and there is also a <a href=\"https://pages.awscloud.com/M1MacPreview.html\">sign-up form</a> for the M1 Mac mini instances preview.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon-web-services/\">Amazon Web Services</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/02/amazon-ec2-m1-mac-mini-instances/\">Amazon's EC2 Service to Offer M1 Mac Mini Instances for Faster Build Times</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/amazons-ec2-service-to-offer-m1-mac-mini-instances-for-faster-build-times.2325930/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=C4YZPaDHvv8:H1tl2mYmP0o:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=C4YZPaDHvv8:H1tl2mYmP0o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4a948566e363a614bdf6182f3530065b9342a9d5ad794473056994eaa9323ed6","category":"Apple"}
