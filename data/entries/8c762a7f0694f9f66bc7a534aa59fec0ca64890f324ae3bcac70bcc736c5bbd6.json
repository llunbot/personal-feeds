The software comes two weeks after the release of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-2/\">visionOS 1.0.2 update</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe new ‌visionOS‌ update can be installed by opening the settings app and going to the software update section. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith ‌visionOS‌ 1.0.3, Apple added an <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213958\">option to reset the Vision Pro headset</a> if the passcode set on the device has been forgotten. It also includes unspecified bug fixes. Apple's release notes:<blockquote>This update provides important bug fixes and adds an option to reset your device if you’ve forgotten your passcode.</blockquote>The Vision Pro launched without a way to reset the device without first unlocking it with a passcode, so those who did end up forgetting their passcodes had to go to an Apple retail store to reset it. With the update, if a passcode is rejected a certain number of times, users will get an option to erase the Vision Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that erasing the Vision Pro does not remove Activation Lock, so a person who stole the headset and used this feature to wipe it would still not be able to log in with their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/12/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-3/\">Apple Releases visionOS 1.0.3 With Reset Option for Forgotten Passcode</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-3-with-reset-option-for-forgotten-passcode.2419277/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8c762a7f0694f9f66bc7a534aa59fec0ca64890f324ae3bcac70bcc736c5bbd6","category":"Apple"}
