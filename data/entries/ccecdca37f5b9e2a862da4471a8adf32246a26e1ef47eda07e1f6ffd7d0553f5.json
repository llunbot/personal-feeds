However, a computer problem has kept the mission's loyal support team in Southern California from knowing much more about the status of one of NASA's longest-lived spacecraft.</p>\n<p>The computer glitch cropped up on November 14, and it affected Voyager 1's ability to send back telemetry data, such as measurements from the spacecraft's science instruments or basic engineering information about how the probe was doing. So, there's no insight into key parameters regarding the craft's propulsion, power, or control systems.</p>\n<p>\"It would be the biggest miracle if we get it back. We certainly haven't given up,\" said Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in an interview with Ars. \"There are other other things we can try. But this is, by far, the most serious since I’ve been project manager.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001426#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001426&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ccecdca37f5b9e2a862da4471a8adf32246a26e1ef47eda07e1f6ffd7d0553f5","category":"Tech"}
