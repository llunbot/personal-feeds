If you’re planning to pick up that new Mac mini, MacBook Pro, or iMac, November could be an exciting month for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those have been announced already, though, and we don’t think there’s a lot else going on outside of the usual Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade releases. The next OS betas—iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, macOS 15.2, and so on—have already begun and will continue through November, but their release is expected in December.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple just announced a trio of new Macs sporting the M4 processor line (M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max) at the end of October. All of them ship on Friday, November 8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2502772/the-m4-imac-has-16gb-ram-and-a-12mp-center-stage-camera-standard.html\">M4 iMac</a>:</strong> In addition to the upgrade to an M4 processor and 16GB of RAM minimum, the iMac gets an improved 12 megapixel camera that supports Center Stage and Desk View.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2505587/the-m4-macbook-pro-gets-a-great-camera-at-last-thunderbolt-5-more-ram.html\">M4 MacBook Pro</a>:</strong> The M4 MacBook Pro is much like the prior model, but with the upgraded 12 megapixel camera that supports Center Stage and Desk View, and 16 GB of RAM at minimum. There are three processors available—M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. M4 Pro and M4 Max models also sport Thunderbolt 5 ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2505587/the-m4-macbook-pro-gets-a-great-camera-at-last-thunderbolt-5-more-ram.html\">M4 Mac mini</a>:</strong> Apple’s smallest Mac gets its first redesign in years, and is now much smaller (5 inches x 5 inches), and a little taller. You can get it with the M4 or M4 Pro, prices still start at $599, and it comes with 16GB of RAM minimum.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1 updates are with us, bringing the first set of Apple Intelligence features. Apple has already begun the beta-testing cycle for<strong> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2499054/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-siri-genmoji-install-release-beta.html\">iOS 18.2</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS 15.2</a></strong>. That will continue throughout November with several updates, but the wide release isn’t scheduled until December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big new features in the x.2 release are the image-generation-related features of Apple Intelligence: Genmoji, Image Playground, Visual Intelligence for iPhone 16, and Image Wand in notes. ChatGPT integration is another big improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in TK.
