He can ride a bike very fast. He is The Next Eddy Merckx<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png\" />. He has as much alcohol-free beer as he can stomach, and <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/05/the-beer-remco-didnt-drink/\">sometimes even remembers to open it.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all of these pale in comparison to one thing: his lucrative Pizza Hut endorsement deal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/remco-evenepoel-is-the-face-of-pizza-hut/\">As we shared in March</a>, Evenepoel signed a five-year contract with the pizza chain – an alliance that was described in an accompanying press release as a “tasty collaboration”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the months since, Evenepoel has been doing his level best to promote a pizza brand that he appears to find almost sinful:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/COBIAOgn5Bu/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/COBIAOgn5Bu/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Remco Evenepoel (@remco.ev)</a></p></div></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, given how long Evenepoel goes between his “cheat days”, it seems that it’s the team staff of Deceuninck-Quick Step that are the real beneficiaries of the sponsorship deal:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQqtRNnHNK6/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQqtRNnHNK6/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Remco Evenepoel (@remco.ev)</a></p></div></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, Evenepoel’s partnership with Pizza Hut continues to bear fruit for his sponsor, which – in brutal news for Belgium – claims to be “the tastiest pizza chain in Belgium”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Het Nieuwsblad <a href=\"https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20210817_92112814\">reports</a>, the young Belgian recently filmed a commercial. Even more exciting news, however, is that there’s going to a new item added to the menu: the ‘Remco’ pizza. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does that look like? We do not know for sure, but Pizza Hut has teased some clues: company CEO Stef Meulemans claims that “it will be a recipe without meat and with lots of vegetables that our new face also likes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A deep scroll of Evenepoel’s social media profiles reveals <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BNmfRoDggCL/\">some big moods</a> for a 16-year-old, but does not disclose whether he is actually vegetarian – or indeed, what vegetables he and his face like. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-lombardia-corvos-4-1340x894.jpg\" /><figcaption>At Il Lombardia, Evenepoel crashed off a bridge and landed on a rotting fowl. Is this the origin story for his current preference for vegetarian pizza? I’m not ruling it out. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That leaves us with some guesswork. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olives? Perhaps! Capers? Why not. Baby spinach? Carrot? Fetta and sundried tomatoes? Girthy slabs of swede? Whole brussels sprouts? A massive eggplant looming resplendent from the marinara sauce? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these could be on the Remco. We don’t know. We just know that it’s coming to a Pizza Hut near you, if you’re in Belgium.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More on this vital story as we have it. </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/remco-evenepoel-will-have-a-pizza-named-after-him/\">Read More</a>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"29f47f93e182447131f38a547ab415f6d3cc8b0426bca41d8bc48be8259c8086","category":"Cycling"}
