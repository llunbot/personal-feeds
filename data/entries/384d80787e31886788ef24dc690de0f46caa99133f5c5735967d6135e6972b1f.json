href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F219022%2Fgiro-aries-spherical-bike-helmet\">Aries Spherical </a>claims big gains in performance and makes a subtle shift in aesthetics, while acing the Virginia Tech Helmet Rating safety test, receiving 5/5 stars.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, I was smitten with the look of the Aries, because frankly, the Giro aesthetic needed a change, and I feel that Giro nailed it. A more prominent Aura II reinforcement arch across the top allows for a beautifully minimal appearance and a strikingly low profile. So compact is the Aries that I had to double-check the label inside to confirm I was indeed holding a size large. Up front, a boxy central vent is cut aggressively into the leading edge, creating a racy and muscular look. Out back, Giro spared no material from being cut away in creating an aggressively tapered shape that balances the looks of the helmet perfectly. The finish on the vents isn’t just clean, it’s razor sharp. The contrasting gloss and matte panels work together to create a seductive visual depth across the helmet’s surface. This masterpiece of form, I learned quickly, was equally impressive in function.</p><p></p><p>The fit of the Aries is excellent and that’s no surprise. Giro figured out bike helmet fit ages ago by using data to map the human head and dial in the shape of their helmets to fit the greatest possible number of people. That said, the Aries is noticeably more luxurious and secure than the range-topping Giro helmets of yesteryear, despite minimal use of padding, which has been replaced with an array of thoughtfully sculpted internal channels. On the road, the Aries continued to pamper while remaining perfectly positioned. Bumps, wind gusts, and full gas sprints never caused any slips or wiggles. Thanks to this supreme stability, I could ride with minimal tension on the Roc Loc 5 adjustment dial, which made the Aries feel even lighter and comfier. </p><p></p><p>Giro claims that the Aries is 2.3% better vented than its predecessor, the Aether. While it’s hard to validate this numerical improvement, I can confirm this helmet moves prodigious amounts of air through its structure, and I am honestly concerned that its venting is so effective that it may not be the optimal helmet for riding in cold conditions. Adding to the Aries’ robust strategy for moisture control, a new DryCore brow pad hides a silicone rubber strip inside its lower edge, where Giro claims it diverts sweat away from the eyes and outward toward the temples. While I can’t confirm with certainty that DryCore actually diverted sweat in this way, it did help keep my forehead dry and seat off of my lenses. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps most importantly, the Giro Aries is the best-performing helmet ever tested by the Virginia Tech Helmet Test Lab. This safety rating speaks to the effectiveness of <em>MIPS Spherical</em> technology, which uses a ball-and-socket design intended to redirect impact forces away from a rider’s head during a crash, with the goal of reducing the risk of concussion. </p><p></p><p>Even after all this praise, $300 is a lot to pay for a helmet. Certainly, there are helmets that compete with the Aries and cost considerably less.

The extra weight of this helmet is noticeable, but so is the excellent ventilation, sleek profile, and enhanced visibility of AVIP (Attention, Visibility, Interaction, and Protection) on the colorway we tested. </p><p></p><p>Beginning with the ventilation, the Omne features five front vents and three rear vents. The three central front vents are matched at the rear, at the opposing end of deep and wide internal channels. It’s a simple but effective layout for ventilation that works well to move air freely over the top of your head. </p><p></p><p>The Omne Air profile looks much better than many helmets which are nearly double the cost. While the aesthetics of some POC helmets have polarized opinions, the Omne takes an understated approach to create a look that’s hard to resist. On the back of the Omne Air, POC has included the option of AVIP (Attention, Visibility, Interaction, and Protection), which is a fancy way of describing the color (very bright) orange. In all seriousness, it’s an effective means of getting motorists’ attention as they approach from behind and actually looks surprisingly cool. It also comes in several less brilliant color options.</p><p></p><p>Branding on the Omne Air is still prevalent but more subdued relative to other POC products from the past. If anybody asks, the acronym stands for Piece Of Cake, but the brand is pronounced “Pock”, not “P, O, C”. </p><p></p><p>Once a head impact has become unavoidable, <em>MIPS Integra</em> steps in to redirect impact forces away from your head, with the goal of reducing rotational forces that reach the brain. Virginia Tech Helmet Lab testing resulted in a score of 4 out of 5 stars for Omne Air. I found the fit of the Omne comfortable and secure, but not airy like the Ventral, POC’s range-topping road helmet. Nevertheless, my head did stay cool and dry while riding in warm conditions with plenty of climbing involved. No pressure points developed, and the plush padding and excellent fit kept the Omne perfectly positioned throughout my rides.</p><p></p><p>For riders looking for a well-vented helmet with a great fit and sleek Scandinavian aesthetics, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F203141%2Fpoc-omne-air-mips-bike-helmet\">POC Omne Air MIPS</a> is a smart choice at a great price. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F203141%2Fpoc-omne-air-mips-bike-helmet\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FTGWLGL/?tag=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-2.jpeg\"><img width=\"2272\" height=\"1515\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-2.jpeg\" alt=\"POC Omne Air MIPS road bike helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-2.jpeg 2272w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-2-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-2-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-2-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-2-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-2-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-2-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>POC’s Omne Air MIPS is a great helmet that costs less than the high-end competition.

A sleek, rounded profile is punctuated by 18 vents and clad with Trek’s OCLV carbon fiber which gives the Velocis a contemporary and race-ready stance. Tipping the scales at just 240g in size medium, this range-topping option from Trek makes a strong impression right out of the box.</p><p></p><p>Inside the shell, you’ll find the <em>MIPS Air</em> – the lightest and best-vented version of MIPS –  integrated into the padding of the Velocis. MIPS systems are designed to redirect impact forces away from a rider’s head during a crash, with the intention of reducing the risk of concussion. For those of us who like to keep padding fresh, the <em>MIPS Air</em> padding is designed to be removed and washed. Just be sure to remove the padding carefully, as it’s connected mechanically to the shell of the Velocis. Although this version of MIPS prioritizes weight savings and ventilation, it’s worth mentioning that the Velocis did receive a 5-star rating from the Virginia Tech University Helmet Lab. This 5-star rating is made even more impressive, given the extremely minimal appearance and feel of not only the MIPS Air but the entire Velocis helmet.  </p><p></p><p>The fit of the Velocis is comfortable, if not exceptionally luxurious. The interior feels firm and secure, with no obvious pressure points. Unlike the Giro Aries, the Velocis is felt at all times while riding.  A three-position yoke in the back of the Velocis allowed for a customized fit and secure hold. Thanks to the yoke, I was also able to get my 60cm head into a medium, which was a nice benefit to both looks and weight savings.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, the 360° BOA® fit system was an unfortunate drawback to the Velocis. While I typically get along well with BOA® generally, I found the feel of the BOA in the single lace adjustment system sloppy and the squeaky sound it made during adjustments unbecoming of a $300 helmet. I suspect the BOA dials need more structure and support than the single-lace adjustment system can offer, so while the idea is great, I felt the execution was not. </p><p></p><p>Once the adjustment was sorted and I was out riding, I found the Velocis a joy to wear. Trek sculpted the leading edge of the Velocis to minimize interference with peripheral vision, which helps when riding with a more aggressive head and neck posture. Sunglasses are easily and securely stored thanks to channels cut into the interior foam. The Velocis is also noticeably quieter than other helmets in its class, speaking to its sleek and minimal shape. Many riders commented on the Velocis, mostly complimenting its looks and conspicuous display of carbon fiber.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=15585&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fequipment%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-helmets%2Froad-bike-helmets%2Ftrek-velocis-mips-road-bike-helmet%2Fp%2F34588%2F\">Trek Velocis MIPS</a> defends its high price point well with a long list of features and a tangible quality that few helmets can match. Its ability to balance the demands of weight-savings, aerodynamics, and cooling makes it a great choice for racing or hunting trophies and crowns on Strava.  </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=15585&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fequipment%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-helmets%2Froad-bike-helmets%2Ftrek-velocis-mips-road-bike-helmet%2Fp%2F34588%2F\">Check Price at Trek Bikes</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trek-Velocis-MIPS-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trek-Velocis-MIPS-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Trek Velocis MIPS road bike helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trek-Velocis-MIPS-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trek-Velocis-MIPS-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trek-Velocis-MIPS-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trek-Velocis-MIPS-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trek-Velocis-MIPS-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trek-Velocis-MIPS-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trek-Velocis-MIPS-1-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trek-Velocis-MIPS-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Trek’s latest version of the Velocis helmet is one of the best all-around models on the market.

A durable outer shell with an impressive array of vents covers a luxurious interior featuring Giro’s renowned fit, industry-leading Roc Loc 5 retention system, and a MIPS liner for rotational impact protection. </p><p></p><p>Quite surprisingly, I found the fit to be as comfortable as Giro’s range-topping Aries Spherical, which costs $300. Out on the road, the most noticeable difference between these two helmets was the slightly less efficient airflow through the Agilis despite its whopping number of vents. That said, compared to other helmets in the same price point, the Agilis moves air most admirably. </p><p></p><p>In addition to its agreeable shape, adjustments to the retention system and straps are simple and quick, meaning you can truly customize the Agilis fit and ride in total comfort. It stayed secure on my head at all speeds.</p><p></p><p>At the $100 price point, the only readily apparent shortcomings are found in a few extra grams of weight, and a slightly rougher finish around the edges of the vents.

The overall finish of the shell and vent edges is exquisite, and the lack of any visible bare foam lends it a contemporary, luxurious look. The profile is unique, with a somewhat rectangular stance and a large shelf at the lower trailing edge. This look won’t please everyone, but trade-offs between aesthetics and big aero gains are nothing new. </p><p></p><p>The Evade 3 is compatible with ANGi, which is a live tracking device, crash detector, and safety beacon that can be added to the <em>Mindset</em> adjustment harness. Once the optional ANGi sensor is paired with the Specialized Ride app, any force consistent with head impact triggers an alarm on your phone and starts a countdown. If you are unable to stop the alarm before the countdown ends, the app sends text and email messages to your emergency contacts with your location. A subscription is required for the ANGi system to operate. </p><p></p><p>Speaking of crashes, the Evade 3 received a 5-star safety rating from the Virginia Tech University Helmet lab which is not all that surprising given its high price tag. The Evade 3 features the MIPS Node Air, which is the most comfortable, best-ventilated, and lightest version of MIPS available. This low-profile version of MIPS is intended to protect the brain from rotational impact forces in certain types of crashes, and its 5-star performance in Virginia Tech’s impact testing makes a strong case for its effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>As with other magnetic buckles, I found the one on the chin strap of the Evade quite fiddly, and perhaps a solution in search of a problem. Once the Evade 3 was secured and adjusted, however, I found the fit to be excellent and did not notice the extra heft of the helmet at all. </p><p></p><p>After riding in the Evade 3 in warm conditions, I can confirm it vents much better than many non-aero helmets, let alone other aero helmets. I would have no hesitation taking it out for a full gas race or ride with lots of climbing in warm weather.

Now, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fkask-protone-icon-helmet\">Kask Protone Icon</a> retains the overall aesthetic of the original but updates the internal shaping to increase ventilation while decreasing aerodynamic drag. A new retention system, which Kask calls<em> Octafit+</em>, includes a new cradle, stabilizer, and rubber inserts that connect to a wider section of the occipital lobe, providing a more secure hold.</p><p></p><p>According to Kask, some subtle changes have been made to the exterior structure as well, aimed at improved aero efficiency, but thankfully these are subtle and don’t change the look at all. Cycling brands have to iterate to stay relevant, and it’s often a case of newer not meaning better, so I applaud Kask for staying true to the winning formula of the original Protone in developing its successor. </p><p></p><p>After putting the Protone Icon on, it was clear that the <em>Octafit+ </em>system gives it a more comfortable and stable fit than the original. Vertical adjustment of the cradle is very easy, with just a gentle push up or pull down in either direction, so finding the correct tilt and a comfortable hold is a breeze. The leather chin strap is a great touch. As someone who likes to occasionally grow some scruff, I find that the leather is better able to resist grabbing and irritating the skin on my throat and should help keep the strap looking better over time than polyester, which is more affected by sweat and friction.  </p><p></p><p>Kask does not use MIPS rotational impact systems, instead using an internal testing protocol called “WG11” to evaluate all their helmets’ performance in rotational impact. Kask claims that the level of friction generated by the head form used in MIPS testing is too great and that the Kask head form provides a more realistic test protocol. Sadly, the Protone Icon has not been tested by the Virginia Tech University Helmet Lab, so its ability to protect against concussions is less quantifiable than some of its competition.</p><p></p><p>Out on the road, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fkask-protone-icon-helmet\">Kask Protone Icon</a> performs perfectly. The torrential airflow and low weight combine to keep things cool and relaxed during even the most searing efforts.

As for KinetiCore, it’s a MIPS alternative that features crumple zones in the EPS foam intended to reduce rotational impact forces that reach the brain in the event of a crash. Given the 5-star rating in Virginia Tech’s independent helmet impact testing, KinetiCore promises to work as advertised. </p><p></p><p>Unboxing the Vento Kineticore, I was immediately impressed with the finish quality. The edges of the vents are finished cleanly, and the contrasting matte and gloss-painted panels give the helmet a seductive look. It’s also light, at just 285 grams, nearly 20% lighter than the S-Works Evade 3, a perennial favorite in the aero helmet category.</p><p></p><p>I found the fit to be a bit wide, with a moderate pressure point immediately evident at the front of the helmet. I was surprised since I’ve always gotten on well with Lazer’s fit, going back to its iconic Genesis design. The back of the Vento Kineticore is remarkably comfortable since the tightening mechanism, dubbed <em>ScrollSys</em>, is built into the rear shell of the helmet, instead of pressing against the occipital lobe. </p><p></p><p>While I found the <em>ScrollSys</em> mechanism easy to understand and operate, the feeling of adjusting it was harsh, loud, and jerky. There was a lot of back-and-forth before I found the sweet spot. My experience with <em>ScrollSys</em> slightly diminished my opinion of the Vento Kinteticore because it would be an experience I’d have every time I put the helmet on. I enjoyed <em>RollSys</em>, as found on the Genesis, but this iteration is an example of newer and different not always resulting in a better experience. </p><p></p><p>Out on the road, the Vento Kineticore performed very well, moving air efficiently through its well-placed vents to keep my head cool and dry. The Vento Kineticore was also noticeably quiet at high speeds, compared to other helmets I tested. While I still felt a bit of pressure at the front and back, the feeling didn’t get any worse after a few hours of riding, so I suspect that the Vento Kineticore is just a better fit for those with slightly wider or rounded head shapes.</p><p></p><p>I also applaud Lazer for offering some bold color combinations. The red and plum test model looked amazing when worn with the bright red S-Phyre RC903 shoes, which are made by Lazer’s parent company, Shimano.

The Portland, OR-based brand has developed a bold design language that’s quite likable. An aggressive stance in the front transitions to a gracefully arched form at the back. It all flows together gracefully, and the contrasting gloss and matte finishes give the Trace a nice visual depth. </p><p></p><p>The fit is excellent, with even pressure, supple padding, and perfectly balanced mass from front to back. Adjusting the Trace is quick and easy, thanks to a simple, quiet, and solid-feeling twist dial. The retention system – dubbed <em>Vaporfit</em> – uses minimal material and is barely noticeable against the occipital lobe once the Trace is on and adjusted. </p><p></p><p>I’d hoped that in a $260 helmet, Smith would use MIPS Air to maximize comfort and breathability, however, Smith opted for a basic MIPS liner that connects to the inside of the EPS structure. It’s a non-issue, though, because Smith controlled the interior shape and pad placement so well that the Trace feels just as comfortable as helmets with MIPS Air. </p><p></p><p>Though the independent helmet impact test lab at Virginia Tech has yet to test and rate the Trace MIPS, its construction supplemented with a MIPS liner and Koroyd provides confidence in its protective qualities. Koroyd is a material designed to dissipate energy during a crash before it can reach your head. The Koryod material is clearly visible in the construction of the Trace, a honeycomb of protection sandwiched between the EPS foam and MIPS liner. </p><p></p><p>On the road, the Trace is brilliant, keeping me cool, dry, and essentially disappearing into the background. The Trace stays firmly in place over rough sections of road, giving me confidence that it would make a great helmet for not only road but also for gravel riding. If you’re looking for a boldly styled, super-comfortable, lightweight, and safe helmet for road, gravel, and even commuting, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F143188%2Fsmith-trace-mips-helmet\">Smith Trace MIPS</a> makes a compelling argument to be your next helmet.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F143188%2Fsmith-trace-mips-helmet\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://smithoptics.pxf.io/c/2227671/1154578/14604?subId1=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smithoptics.com%2Fen_US%2Fp%2Fhelmet%2Ftrace-mips-road-helmet%2FE007280XL5559.html\">Check Price at Smith Optics</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJX2YRPQ/brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet-20\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tABUS Powerdome\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$130 w/o MIPS, $170 with MIPS</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>240g (Large)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rotational Impact Protection System</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>MIPS (optional)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Number of Vents</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>10</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>S, M, L</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Virginia Tech Helmet Safety Rating</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>4-star (MIPS version)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Shiny White, Shiny Black, Velvet Black, Flip Flop Purple.</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABUS-Powerdome.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1245\" height=\"830\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABUS-Powerdome.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Helmets of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABUS-Powerdome.jpeg 1245w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABUS-Powerdome-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABUS-Powerdome-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABUS-Powerdome-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABUS-Powerdome-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ABUS-Powerdome-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Prodigious ventilation</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Uber compact profile</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightweight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Affordable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>None</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJX2YRPQ/brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet-20\">Abus Powerdome</a> is a lightweight, compact helmet that prioritizes ventilation and comfort. The fit differs from some better-known helmet brands, as the Powerdome sits a bit higher on the head rather than surrounding it. </p><p></p><p>We like the idea of a helmet achieving decent aero performance through a super compact profile versus a bulbous shape that adds weight and sacrifices ventilation for increased laminar airflow. The Abus Powerdome achieves the former, with a tidy profile that is well-appointed with vents, including a huge air inlet at the top of the helmet, modeled after the “Powerdome” of high-performance cars and which gives the helmet its name as a functional design element.</p><p></p><p>Due to its low weight and compact shape, I honestly forgot the Powerdome was even there during some intense rides in hilly terrain. Rough descents were no bother, as the Powerdome stayed in place perfectly at all times. The strap system is simple and free of flapping at high speed. All in all, the experience of riding in the Powerdome was better than its mid-range pricing would suggest.</p><p></p><p>Although our test helmet did not come equipped with a rotational impact protection system, Abus offers the Powerdome with a MIPS system as well. Without MIPS, the Powerdome sells for $130, and with MIPS the price jumps to $170. MIPS creates a low-friction layer within the helmet that allows the outer layer of the helmet to move 10-15mm during angled impacts, with the goal of limiting the rotational force applied to your head and reducing the chance of a concussion. Since safety is the reason to wear a helmet in the first place, we always recommend springing for a helmet with a rotational impact protection system.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJX2YRPQ/brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet-20\">Abus Powerdome</a> achieves impressive comfort, ventilation, and weight savings. We also love the look of it from every angle and were impressed with how quietly it cut through the air. If you want a simple but elegant helmet that is comfortable and looks the part for racing and riding on the rivet, check out the Abus Powerdome.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJX2YRPQ/brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fbell-xr-spherical-helmet\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBell XR Spherical\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$225</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>285g (Medium)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rotational Impact Protection System</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>MIPS Spherical</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Number of Vents</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>13</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>S, M, L</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Virginia Tech Helmet Safety Rating</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>5-star</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Colors</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Black, Blue, Green, Camo, Pink, Titanium, White/Black</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-XR-Spherical.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"695\" height=\"463\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-XR-Spherical.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Helmets of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-XR-Spherical.jpeg 695w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-XR-Spherical-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell-XR-Spherical-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Good fit</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Good ventilation</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Excellent coverage</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Looks a lot like a XC MTB helmet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Magnetic strap clasp is fiddly</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Big branding</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fbell-xr-spherical-helmet\">Bell XR Spherical</a> helmet doesn’t look like most road helmets, but what it may lack in looks, it makes up for in spades with a great fit, impressive ventilation, a little extra head coverage, and the incorporation of MIPS Spherical technology. </p><p></p><p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it’s easy to see some XC mountain bike influence in the XR Spherical. Its overall shape, especially around the lower trailing edge, is rather square and chunky and it drops down at the back of the head more than most road helmets. The gradient fade paint scheme is cool, but is somewhat diminished by the enormous Bell logos flanking the XR’s trailing edge. </p><p></p><p>The fit is sublime, which is no surprise given Bell’s, and sister company, Giro’s, decades of experience making cycling helmets. Pressure is perfectly distributed around the interior and luxurious padding combines with intelligently sculpted channeling to create an easy but secure hold. The Float adjustment system is smooth and quiet.</p><p></p><p>Personally, I don’t care for using magnetic buckles on chin straps. I find it to be a feature in search of a benefit. I’ve been told that I have the hands of a carpenter, so maybe it’s just me. </p><p></p><p>As of publication, Virginia Tech University has yet to test the Bell XR Spherical. That said, given the above-average head coverage and the use of MIPS Spherical technology, which uses a ball-and-socket design to redirect rotational impact forces away from a rider’s head during a crash, it looks and feels quite protective.</p><p></p><p>If you’re in the market for a road bike helmet that provides a little more coverage than most, or you’re looking for a versatile option that

Tonic KinetiCore</a> is the brand’s entry-level helmet road cycling model, but managed to impress, even compared to the range-topping Vento Kineticore aero helmet. At $80, it makes a strong case as a clear standout in the entry-level pricepoint of road helmets. </p><p></p><p>The Tonic’s fit is excellent, and I found it more comfortable than the range-topping Vento. I found the simple twist-dial adjustment knob in the retention system to be a refreshing change after fussing around with the Vento Kineticore’s ScrollSys adjustment. The Tonic is also much lighter than the Vento. All this prompts the question, why is the Tonic so inexpensive? For starters, the ventilation of the Tonic is limited, meaning that riding hard in hot conditions could cause excessive sweating. The Tonic also has a very safe aesthetic, verging on being a bit dull to look at. It certainly doesn’t look expensive or race-inspired. Storing sunglasses in the Tonic wasn’t a great experience either, so I ended up just clasping the glasses to the back of my jersey collar. </p><p></p><p>The Tonic uses Lazer’s KinetiCore technology,  a MIPS alternative that features crumple zones in the EPS foam intended to provide rotational impact protection in the event of a head-impact crash. The system promises to work great, as the Virginia Tech University Helmet Lab awarded 5 out of 5 stars to The Tonic Kineticore after crash-testing.</p><p></p><p>Overall, riding in the Tonic was great, although I did start to feel a bit warm even just cruising around town in mildly warm spring weather. The Tonic stayed in place well, thanks to its perfect fit and ample, soft padding. Aside from not having a great place to easily store my sunglasses and its somewhat bland appearance, I didn’t have any other complaints about it.

We have analyzed and tested a diverse lineup to help you understand the options and pick the best helmet for your next ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Types of Road Bike Helmets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can road bike is just about any helmet you choose, helmets designed specifically for road cycling are the best fit for the task. Road bike helmets aim to balance sleek and streamlined designs with lightweight constructions and good ventilation while remaining protective in the event of a crash and head impact. They generally fall into two categories, lightweight and vented or aero. They differ from their mountain bike counterparts mostly by their lighter weight, reduced head coverage, and lack of a visor. If you’re looking for the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-helmet/\">best mountain bike helmet</a>, don’t worry, we’ve tested those too. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-1.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-1-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Giro Aries Spherical lightweight vented helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-1-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Lightweight and well-ventilated helmets, like the Giro Aries Spherical pictured here, are versatile and make the most sense for most riders. (photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Lightweight-Vented Road Bike Helmets</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the more common style of helmet that the majority of road cyclists choose for most types of riding. Airflow will be better in a lightweight-vented helmet than in an aero helmet since air is directed through vents and onto your scalp, rather than along the helmet’s surface. Riders who sweat more than average, spend a lot of time climbing, or often ride in extreme heat will benefit more from the superior cooling power of a lightweight-vented helmet. Can’t decide between an aero or a lightweight-vented helmet? The good news is that most brands have begun to incorporate aero shaping into the back and sides of lightweight-vented helmets, without compromising ventilation at the front and top of the helmet, where it is most needed.

(photo: Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Aero Road Bike Helmets</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most helmet manufacturers offer an aerodynamically shaped helmet that is designed to smooth airflow over your head, resulting in faster speeds on the bike at the same level of rider effort. Keep in mind that these aerodynamic gains do typically incur marginal losses in ventilation, and add some weight to the helmet. Aero helmets may also perform better in a temperate or cold climate, as they shield your head more from cold air and light rainfall. While most aerodynamic equipment is a massive commitment of resources, an aero helmet can reduce your aero drag without draining your coffers. Research also indicates that dollar for dollar, an aero helmet is a more effective way to reduce aero drag when compared to frames and wheels. Models like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-s-works-evade-3-mips-helmet\">Specialized S-Works Evade 3</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Flazer-vento-kineticore-helmet\">Lazer Vento KinetiCore</a> are good examples of aero road bike helmets. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giro-Aries-Spherical-fit-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giro-Aries-Spherical-fit-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding in the Giro Aries Spherical road bike helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giro-Aries-Spherical-fit-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giro-Aries-Spherical-fit-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giro-Aries-Spherical-fit-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giro-Aries-Spherical-fit-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giro-Aries-Spherical-fit-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giro-Aries-Spherical-fit-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giro-Aries-Spherical-fit-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giro-Aries-Spherical-fit-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>For a helmet to protect your head and be comfortable, it’s important to get the correct size. (photo: Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Helmet Fit</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Helmet fit will be personal to everyone. Some helmets will feel more oval in shape and others more circular; some will feel more luxurious and others more minimal. With some adjustment and fine-tuning, you should be able to achieve a comfortable and safe fit with any helmet in this guide, provided it’s the correct size. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great first step is to measure the circumference of your head just above your ears, in centimeters. Taking this step will quantify which size helmet you will be able to wear in each model. When you looking at helmets, look for the centimeter range corresponding to each size in the manufacturer’s size guide or printed on the box. There is no standard centimeter range for “small”, “medium”, and “large” sizes, so knowing the actual centimeter sizing of your head can save some time here. Whenever possible, it is always a good idea to try and helmet on before buying to ensure it fits properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the correct size is chosen, and the retention system, tightening mechanism, and strap systems are adjusted to your needs, you will ideally have a snug but accommodating fit, without any pressure points. The helmet should also cover your temples easily and come close to the tops of your ears. When swaying your head side-to-side, the helmet should stay firmly in place. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Smith-Trace-MIPS-straps-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Smith-Trace-MIPS-straps-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Smith Trace MIPS straps\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Smith-Trace-MIPS-straps-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Smith-Trace-MIPS-straps-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Smith-Trace-MIPS-straps-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Smith-Trace-MIPS-straps-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Smith-Trace-MIPS-straps-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Smith-Trace-MIPS-straps-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Smith-Trace-MIPS-straps-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Smith-Trace-MIPS-straps-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>A helmet’s straps are key to keeping it on your head in the event of a crash. When adjusted properly, it should be secure with the straps laying flat and not conflicting with the ears. (photo: Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Chin Straps</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A helmet’s strap system connects the helmet’s straps beneath your chin and keeps the helmet in place during a crash. When adjusted properly, the outer junctions of the straps by the ears should sit comfortably below your ear lobes, and both sections of the strap should be as close as possible to your head, to minimize flapping in the wind. Under your chin, the strap should fit such that you can slide two fingers between the bottom of your chin and the strap, ensuring you can breathe comfortably. The chin strap is always adjustable, so it can be dialed in to fit the user’s head shape. The straps around the ears are typically also adjustable, though the systems vary slightly between brands and models to allow the user to position them to avoid unwanted ear contact. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Abus-Powerdome-retention-system.jpeg\"><img width=\"2536\" height=\"1720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Abus-Powerdome-retention-system.jpeg\" alt=\"ABUS Powerdome road bike helmet adjustable harness\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Abus-Powerdome-retention-system.jpeg 2536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Abus-Powerdome-retention-system-297x201.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Abus-Powerdome-retention-system-800x543.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Abus-Powerdome-retention-system-120x81.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Abus-Powerdome-retention-system-768x521.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Abus-Powerdome-retention-system-1536x1042.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Abus-Powerdome-retention-system-2048x1389.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>The adjustable harness and its tightening mechanism, like this one on the ABUS Powerdome, are used to fine-tune a helmet’s fit for security and stability.

Most helmets enable adjustment of the entire retention system at the rear interior of the helmet. By adjusting where the retention system is anchored inside the helmet, you can dramatically change the interior volume and fore/aft tilt of the helmet to perfect the fit for your specific head shape. Ideally, by adjusting the retention system correctly, you will place the adjustable harness and its tightening mechanism so that it cradles the base of your occipital lobe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Tightening Mechanism</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll use the tightening mechanism on the adjustment harness every time you put on or remove the helmet to fine-tune the fit. Some companies use BOA dials like you’ll find on many shoes, or some other sort of simple twist dial. Other companies use more complicated mechanisms with varying success. This part of the helmet just needs to work, and its operation should be intuitive, fast, and quiet while performing the important function of keeping the helmet snug, secure, and comfortable on your head.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell_XR-Spherical_MIPS-1.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell_XR-Spherical_MIPS-1-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Bell XR Spherical rotational impact protection.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell_XR-Spherical_MIPS-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell_XR-Spherical_MIPS-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell_XR-Spherical_MIPS-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell_XR-Spherical_MIPS-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell_XR-Spherical_MIPS-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell_XR-Spherical_MIPS-1-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bell_XR-Spherical_MIPS-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Most helmets feature some type of rotational impact protection system, like the Bell XR MIPS Spherical which has dual shells that can move independently of each other with the goal of reducing forces transferred to the brain. (photo: Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Rotational Impact Protection</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rotational impact protection systems have become relatively standard in cycling helmets over the past decade or so. MIPS – Multi-directional Impact Protection System – is the industry leader and the most common form of rotational impact protection. Most brands have licensed some iteration of this technology or developed a proprietary system to achieve similar results. The goal with MIPS and similar systems is to create a low-friction layer, or slip-plane, within the helmet that allows the outer layer of the helmet to move 10-15mm during angled impacts, thus limiting the rotational force applied to your head/brain, and reducing the chance of a concussion. MIPS itself now takes various forms and iterations including a more standard MIPS liner, MIPS Spherical (dual shells that function like a ball and socket), MIPS Integra, and MIPS Air which incorporates the technology into the pads themselves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other brands have created their own technologies that aim to provide the same type of rotational impact protection with different designs. Lazer has developed KinetiCore which involves small isolated blocks of EPS foam within the helmet that are designed to crush and crumple on impact and is used in the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Flazer-tonic-kineticore-helmet\">Tonic KinetiCore</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F143188%2Fsmith-trace-mips-helmet\">Vento KinetiCore</a>. Bontrager uses a cellular structure called WaveCel in some of their helmets that is intended to work in much the same way. Similarly, Smith incorporates Koroyd into many of its helmets, including the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F143188%2Fsmith-trace-mips-helmet\">Trace MIPS</a>, which is a cellular structure like WaveCel that is meant to crush and crumple on impact while allowing air to pass through. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Safety Rating</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All helmets must pass tests to be certified for sale in their respective countries. Since 1999 in the US, the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) is the certifying agency that must approve a helmet before it can be legally sold. In Europe, the cycling standard is CE-EN1078. Most modern helmets that are sold in multiple markets pass both certifications. In some cases, cheap products purchased online may not meet these certification standards, which is why we recommend that cyclists always buy reputable name-brand helmets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we do not perform impact testing on the helmets we test and review, we have come to rely on the independent test lab at <a href=\"https://www.helmet.beam.vt.edu/bicycle-helmet-ratings.html\">Virginia Tech</a> for quantifiable data regarding the protective qualities of bicycle helmets. As of the publication date of this article, they have tested 193 different road, mountain, and commuter cycling helmets. Using specialized equipment, they evaluate each helmet using 24 impact tests. They measure a helmet’s ability to decrease both linear acceleration and rotational velocity to determine how well each model may reduce the risk of concussion. Their numerical results translate to a star rating, 1-5, with 5 being the highest and most protective. The lab has not tested every model on the market or included in our review, but many of the models listed above have been rated. In fact, our best overall road bike helmet, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F219022%2Fgiro-aries-spherical-bike-helmet\">Giro Aries Spherical</a>, is the top-rated model for protection that they have tested to date. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-weight-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-weight-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Giro Aries Spherical on the scale\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-weight-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-weight-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-weight-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-weight-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-weight-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-weight-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Giro-Aries-Spherical-weight-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Light is right, right? The Giro Aries Spherical weighs in at a feathery 271 grams in a size medium. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Weight</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As with most things in the sport of road cycling, weight is a consideration for helmets as well. While it is not the end all be all, lighter is generally considered better if all other things are equal, and helmets must pass the same certification tests irrespective of weight. The weight of the helmets we tested varies between 230 grams and 350 grams, so the differences between them may seem pretty significant. In reality, a 350-gram helmet is still relatively lightweight, though it will feel slightly heavier on the head than a featherlight 230-gram model. That said, riders focused on endurance riding or road racing will generally be most concerned with weight, as even an extra 50 grams can increase neck strain with each passing hour on the bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Function Over Form?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though a bike helmet is a great example of form following function, it’s important to like the way your helmet looks. Consider the arrangement and finish of the helmet’s vents. Vents should be arranged in a way that’s pleasing to your eye, augmenting the helmet’s overall shape. Vents should also be finished cleanly, without rough edges of foam visible. Also, consider the helmet’s overall shape and profile. Does the helmet look overly bulbous once you have put it on, or does it have a compact, streamlined form? Remember that the back of the helmet is the portion most visible to people when you are riding together. It’s worth noting that brightly colored helmets, including silver and white, also increase your visibility to motorists while you ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lazer-Vento-KinetiCore-style-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lazer-Vento-KinetiCore-style-scaled.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lazer-Vento-KinetiCore-style-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lazer-Vento-KinetiCore-style-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lazer-Vento-KinetiCore-style-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lazer-Vento-KinetiCore-style-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lazer-Vento-KinetiCore-style-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lazer-Vento-KinetiCore-style-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lazer-Vento-KinetiCore-style-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lazer-Vento-KinetiCore-style-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>While helmets are designed to protect your head, we always appreciate a little style as well.

Some helmets have dedicated spaces for storing sunglasses, and others enable lights to be clipped to the helmet at the back and sides for night riding. Specialized has developed the ANGI (Angular and G-Force indicator) system,  which is a crash detection sensor that can be purchased separately and added to your helmet. ANGi requires a subscription, but this little device can notify your emergency contacts in the event of a crash. ABUS has also developed a sensor called QUIN that aims to function in a similar way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The helmets we tested vary in price from $80 up to $300. While spending top dollar may get you more premium finishes, better ventilation, and fancier features, even the least expensive helmets we tested will serve you well if you’re operating on a tighter budget. If you’re a recreational or more casual rider, or you simply aren’t concerned with having the flashiest and most expensive gear, then a helmet like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F173247%2Fgiro-agilis-mips-bike-helmet\">Giro Agilis MIPS</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikehelmet&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Flazer-tonic-kineticore-helmet\">Lazer Tonic KinetiCore</a> will get the job done at a fraction of the cost of the more expensive options. Regardless of price, the most important thing is to get a helmet that fits properly and to wear it whenever you throw your leg over the bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Road Bike Helmets</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How much should I spend on a road bike helmet?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Any type of cycling can be very expensive, and the costs aren’t limited to the latest bikes and components. Even a fancy helmet can set you back several hundred dollars. It’s hard to put a price tag on head protection, however, but thankfully, many brands make budget-friendly models that perform nearly as well as their more expensive counterparts. They may be slightly heavier, not as well-ventilated, and perhaps not as stylish, but even a less expensive helmet will protect your head much better than none at all. And, even less expensive models must pass the same certification tests as the high-end models, and many of them perform better in Virginia Tech testing. So, just because a helmet doesn’t cost as much doesn’t mean that you have to sacrifice head protection in most cases. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How do I find the right fit?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p> A properly fitting helmet is critical to your comfort and the helmet’s protective efficacy in the event of a crash. The first thing you need to do is get the correct shell size. Trying a helmet on is a surefire way to find the right size, so we recommend doing that whenever possible. Alternatively, measuring your head will show you what size you need. Using a soft measuring tape, measure the circumference of your head just above the ears to find your size in centimeters. If you don’t have a soft measuring tape, a piece of string and a ruler can be used instead. This measurement should fall within the recommended size range of one of a helmet’s multiple shell sizes. Helmet manufacturers have size charts on their websites where you can find the sizing information for each specific model.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Do I need MIPS or another rotational impact protection system?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Rotational impact protection systems like MIPS have been around for the past decade or so and have become pretty ubiquitous among all types of cycling helmets. Most, but not all, helmets these days come with some form of MIPS or another design that is intended to work similarly. While there is some speculation about the effectiveness of these systems, research suggests that they do help reduce the rotational forces that reach the brain in certain types of impacts. Now, even a helmet without a rotational impact protection system will protect your head from direct impact and help to dissipate impact forces. That said, we are happy to have additional safety features built into helmets, no matter how small the added protection may be. So, the answer is no, you don’t <em>need</em> MIPS or something similar in your helmet, but we’ll take all the protection we can get. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Will an aero helmet actually make me faster?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Aerodynamic helmets are designed to allow air to move more freely around and over the helmet with the goal of reducing drag. They do this by having smoother surfaces and more sculpted designs than their all-around counterparts. An aero helmet will almost always have less drag than a helmet that isn’t specifically designed to be super aerodynamic, and most have undergone extensive wind tunnel testing to ensure they work as intended. In general, an aero helmet will provide a marginal gain in efficiency, which, when added up over time can result in a more substantial savings of time and energy. That said, aero helmets tend to have a slight reduction in ventilation and a slight increase in weight, comparatively, so that is something to be considered. Still, if saving a few watts and seconds is important to you, an aero helmet can help you do that, and it costs a lot less than an aero bike or aero wheels. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>If I crash and hit my head, should I replace my helmet?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Yes. Helmets are designed to protect your head by absorbing impact forces through crushing and cracking of the EPS foam and outer shell. Any time your helmeted head impacts the ground, the structural integrity and protective qualities of the helmet can be compromised and it should be replaced. Even if there is no visible damage to the foam or any other part of the helmet, there may be damage that cannot be seen. It is always recommended that you replace your helmet after it has taken an impact. Some brands even offer crash replacements at a discounted rate. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-shoes/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Shimano S-Phyre RC9 road bike shoe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Road Bike Shoes of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-helmet/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"mountain bike helmets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Mountain Bike Helmets of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-helmets/\">The Best Road Bike Helmets of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"384d80787e31886788ef24dc690de0f46caa99133f5c5735967d6135e6972b1f","category":"Cycling"}
