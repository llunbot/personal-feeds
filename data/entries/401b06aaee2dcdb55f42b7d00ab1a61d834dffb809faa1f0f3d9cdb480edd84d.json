What if each day gave us more than double that time? If it wasn’t for a phenomenon that put the lengthening of Earth’s days on pause billions of years ago, that would have probably happened.</p>\n<p>Earth has not always had 24-hour days. There were fewer than 10 hours in a day when the Moon first came into being around 4.5 billion years ago, but they have grown longer as lunar <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/01/thin-atmosphere-is-enough-to-keep-many-exoplanets-spinning/\">tidal forces</a> gradually slowed Earth’s rotation. But there was a long period when days didn’t grow at all. Astrophysicists have now found that, from 2 billion to 600 million years ago, days were about 19.5 hours because several tidal forces canceled each other out and kept Earth rotating at the same speed for over a billion years. If that had never happened, our present days might be over 65 hours long.</p>\n<p>“The fact that the day is 24 hours long…is not a coincidence,” the research team said in a study recently published in <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add2499\">Science Advances</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954165#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954165&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"401b06aaee2dcdb55f42b7d00ab1a61d834dffb809faa1f0f3d9cdb480edd84d","category":"Tech"}
