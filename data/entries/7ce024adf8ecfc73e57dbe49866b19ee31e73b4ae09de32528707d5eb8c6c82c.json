Under her plan, the FCC would evaluate broadband availability, speeds, and prices to determine whether to take regulatory actions to promote network deployment and competition.</p>\n<p>Rosenworcel hasn't revealed anything about how affordability will be measured. But in a proposed Notice of Inquiry that would start an evaluation of broadband deployment across the US, she included affordability as one of the aspects to be considered.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956502#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956502&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7ce024adf8ecfc73e57dbe49866b19ee31e73b4ae09de32528707d5eb8c6c82c","category":"Tech"}
