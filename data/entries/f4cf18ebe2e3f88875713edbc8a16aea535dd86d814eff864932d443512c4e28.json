Cady's focus was on data-driven and targeted advertising, including responsibility for the Comcast subsidiary's partnerships with Amazon, Google, TikTok, and others, according to the report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCady is expected to work with Winston Crawford, Apple's head of global ad sales. Apple's TV+ team reports to Crawford, who also helped lead Apple's Major League Soccer ad sales pitch with Todd Teresi, lead of Apple's ads division.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report also mentions several other recent recruits to Apple's ads team, such as Chandler Taylor (formerly a video ads account manager with Peacock), Jacqueline Bleazey from FanDuel's ad sales team, and Jason Brum, who has worked for DirecTV, NBCUniversal, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has not indicated one way or the other whether an ad-supported tier for TV+ is in the works, but it would make sense given that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/04/netflix-basic-with-ads-plan-doesnt-work-apple-tv/\">Netflix</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/10/disney-plus-price-changes-ad-supported-tier/\">Disney+</a>, and Max all now offer ad-based plans at a discounted price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple increased its TV+ subscription prices in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/\">October</a> to $9.99 a month from $6.99 a month, while the annual subscription price increased from $69 per year to $99 per year, so a more affordable option would make sense from a competitive perspective.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/ads-for-apple-tv-job-hires-suggest/\">Cheaper Apple TV+ With Ads Plan a Possibility, Recent Job Hires Suggest</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/cheaper-apple-tv-with-ads-plan-a-possibility-recent-job-hires-suggest.2421704/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f4cf18ebe2e3f88875713edbc8a16aea535dd86d814eff864932d443512c4e28","category":"Apple"}
