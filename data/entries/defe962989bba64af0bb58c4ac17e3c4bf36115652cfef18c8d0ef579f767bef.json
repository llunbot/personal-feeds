Apple says the feature even works in especially noisy environments, such as outdoors on a windy day or inside a crowded restaurant.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis feature is not available on the Apple Watch Series 9 or older, but the Apple Watch Ultra 2 does already feature wind noise reduction.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for iPhones, there is already a voice isolation setting available for phone calls, but all four iPhone 16 models have gained wind noise reduction on top. Apple says machine learning algorithms reduce wind noise for better audio quality, but we'll have to wait for tests to see how much of an improvement there is over previous iPhones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Watch Series 10 pre-orders began yesterday, and the device will begin arriving to customers on Friday, September 20.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/apple-watch-series-10-reduces-wind-noise-on-calls/\">Apple Watch Series 10 Reduces Wind Noise During Phone Calls</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-10-reduces-wind-noise-during-phone-calls.2435784/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"defe962989bba64af0bb58c4ac17e3c4bf36115652cfef18c8d0ef579f767bef","category":"Apple"}
