If you find yourself staring out into colder streets, your summer commuter tires aren’t the best option for when it gets cold, wet, and soupy. Bloomington, Minnesota’s <a href=\"https://www.45nrth.com/#/\">45NRTH</a> knows cold and wet, and may have the perfect tire with Latkat – a commuter-specific tire to help you keep the rubber side down when road conditions are the opposite of ideal. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-logo-shot-e1700668125629.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-logo-shot-e1700668125629.jpeg\" alt=\"45NRTH Latkat Commuter Tire logo shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-logo-shot-e1700668125629.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-logo-shot-e1700668125629-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-logo-shot-e1700668125629-120x68.jpeg 120w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/45NRTH)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>45NRTH says the Latkat offers predictable performance on cold, wet roads thanks to their Gripkraft rubber compound. Note that the Latkat is specifically a non-studded winter tire. If you want or need studs, check out their Gravdal or Xerxes tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-full-tire-shot.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-full-tire-shot.jpeg\" alt=\"45NRTH Latkat Commuter Tire full tire shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-full-tire-shot.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-full-tire-shot-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-full-tire-shot-120x120.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gripkraft compound provides “extra grip and control in wet conditions, making LatKat the best road bike tire for winter conditions”. This tire should allow the rider to “stick” to the ground while carrying more speed with more confidence. In addition to the rubber compound meant for colder conditions, the tread pattern has a huge number of sipes and grooves to channel water, slush, and snow away from the tread blocks for increased grip. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-side-shot.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-side-shot.jpeg\" alt=\"45NRTH Latkat Commuter Tire side shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-side-shot.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-side-shot-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-side-shot-120x120.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-other-side-shot.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-other-side-shot.jpeg\" alt=\"45NRTH Latkat Commuter Tire other side shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-other-side-shot.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-other-side-shot-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/45NRTH-Latkat-Commuter-Tire-other-side-shot-120x120.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Latkat is a 700c x 40mm, foldable, tubeless compatible tire that is optimized for a rim with a 20-25mm internal width.
