With Ravemen lights you can always be sure to see and be seen, no matter the conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ravemen started in 2013 on the premise of creating lights that are safe for riders while being friendly to others. After a couple of years developing its first product, the brand successfully made the only bike light with high and low beams like a car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the years since, Ravemen has continued to develop its range and its technologies to make a collection of lights ideal for cyclists across the spectrum, from commuter to all-out racer and everything in between. In doing so it has constantly innovated to push on not just the brand but the whole market to make riders safer. And that’s a big part of the Ravemen philosophy, as the brand prioritises reliability, friendly design and innovation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, that initial product has been developed into a range based around the unique optical lens, and user-friendly features including a runtime display, so you always know how much battery is left, as well as wireless control and USB output functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ravemen PR2000</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-pr2000-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-pr2000-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-pr2000-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-pr2000-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-pr2000-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-pr2000-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-pr2000-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-pr2000-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-pr2000-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-pr2000-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-pr2000.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The PR2000 is a powerful light that’s packed with clever features. Its 2,000 lumens max brightness mean you can find daylight in the darkest places with different modes for road and off-road riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Road biking mode uses the DuaLens optical design to provide a wide but close-range light with a low-beam and no dazzle or glare for oncoming riders, pedestrians or traffic. Mountain biking mode uses the HiLo beam system, which brings a similar light to cars with a far-reaching high beam as well as a wide low-beam. Riders can easily switch between beams and brightness levels with the wireless switch that attaches to the bars, it only needs a single click to get the light back to max output when required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also features the LED runtime display, which indicates which mode you’re in and cleverly shows the remaining battery life in each brightness level. Run time ranges from 1.1 hours to 25 hours depending on the mode and brightness level you’re using, but if battery is a concern for the length of your rides, it has a USB-C charging port so you can charge it on the go, and it also has a USB output so you can charge other devices in case of emergency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on top of all that it’s IPX8 waterproof, durable and easy to slide in and out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ravemen CR1000</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-cr1000-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-cr1000-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-cr1000-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-cr1000-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-cr1000-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-cr1000-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-cr1000-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-cr1000-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-cr1000-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-cr1000-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-cr1000.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The CR1000 has a huge runtime of up to 45 hours. It’s made for road cyclists that ride at night, at high speed and over long distances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its anti-glare lens provides a T-shaped beam that shows both a close-range flood light and long-range spotlight, and it also has a cutoff to avoid dazzling other road users. On top of that it features small side lights to help you be seen each way, especially useful when using crossroads at night. The remote switch is wired here but is simpler, with one button that can be long-pressed to take it to max output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the PR2000 it can be plugged into an external source to extend the battery even more. It’s IPX6 water-resistant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ravemen FR300</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-fr300-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-fr300-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-fr300-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-fr300-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-fr300-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-fr300-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-fr300-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-fr300-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-fr300-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-fr300-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-fr300.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The FR300 is really clever. It doubles up as a light and a computer mount that can take either Garmin or Wahoo computers, keeping the front of your bike clean but safe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The light itself is a strong daytime running light that gives out 300 lumens in its flashing mode and has a runtime of up to 24 hours. It has three constant and three flashing modes to choose from, and uses a wide-angle lens for maximum visibility from the side. It also can be used to charge your computer to keep it going on long rides, and it has an auto on-off mode so you won’t forget to turn it off. It’s IPX6 water resistant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ravemen TR500 Brake Light</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-tr500-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-tr500-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-tr500-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-tr500-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-tr500-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-tr500-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-tr500-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-tr500-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-tr500-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-tr500-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ravemen-tr500.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the TR500, which is a rear light that has a brake sensor to increase your visibility to those behind you when slowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible with both round and aero seatposts so anyone can use it, it has six different modes for day and night use, with a max of 500 lumens and eye-catching flashing patterns. The brake sensor switches the light to 200 lumens for two seconds when it detects braking, and it has an auto on-off so it switches off after staying still for two minutes and back on again with vibration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It features side stripes for extra side visibility and has a USB-C charging port. Runtime ranges from 4.5 to 21 hours and it weighs just 77g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get 10% off in all four of these lights with the code: cyclist10% at <a href=\"https://shop.ravemen.com?utm_source=Cyclist&amp;utm_medium=webart\" target=\"_blank\">shop.ravemen.com</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/ravemen-lights\">Ravemen lights are the smartest on the market</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"eb0fdd218395a708679ed679d2710897889df11cbed2ebf90e674e07d30f2e60","category":"Cycling"}
