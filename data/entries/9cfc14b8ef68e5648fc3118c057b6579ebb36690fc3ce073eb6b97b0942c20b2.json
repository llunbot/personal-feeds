But you might still be in for a scare. The animal's flesh can be riddled with encased worm larvae, which, upon being eaten, will gladly reproduce in your innards and let their offspring roam the rest of your person, including invading your brain and heart. To defeat these savage squirmers, all one must do is cook the meat to at least 165° Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p>But that simple solution continues to be ignored, according to a report today in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. In this week's issue, health officials in North Carolina report that rare bear meat was served at a November 23 gathering, where at least 22 people ate the meat and at least 10 developed symptoms of a worm infection. Of the 10, six were kids and teens between the ages of 10 and 18.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/rare-bear-meat-at-gathering-gives-10-people-a-scare-and-parasitic-worms/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/rare-bear-meat-at-gathering-gives-10-people-a-scare-and-parasitic-worms/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9cfc14b8ef68e5648fc3118c057b6579ebb36690fc3ce073eb6b97b0942c20b2","category":"Tech"}
