It has only been available for the Mac and uses a lot of Mac-specific technologies to improve performance. There is also an iOS companion app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is unclear what Apple will do with the acquisition. If we had to guess, we would say that Apple will continue to develop the app, offering it as a third pro-level software offering alongside <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/\">Logic Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/\">Final Cut Pro</a>. Pixelmator’s photo-editing app, <a href=\"https://www.pixelmator.com/photomator/\">Photomator</a>, may find some of its features wrapped up into the editing interface for the Photos app, but Apple seemingly has little need for a separate consumer photo editing app of that nature.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fdbc6610be39b065faa08e220ab903a5a751218e95656e8a07c944c8d4a9bd57","category":"Apple"}
