But one element came in for stern criticism: the USB-C port.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the presenter notes, the 16e is based on the architecture of the iPhone 14, and this creates some oddities. In some respects the new phone is extremely progressive, featuring a state-of-the-art A18 processor and the first ever sighting of Apple’s in-house C1 modem. But in others it keeps the same design–and repairability problems–as the old 14.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As I’m removing the Taptic Engine and the SIM card space holder,” the presenter explains, “I realise that the USB-C port removal process that saw a significant simplification in the 16 Pro and Pro Max has regressed in the iPhone 16e.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is probably because of the shared architecture with the base model iPhone 14, but it’s still disappointing to see.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is that repairers cannot simply remove a damaged port assembly and slot in a replacement. Rather, a litany of other components must come out first to allow access: the IR camera, IR projector, and selfie camera; the main camera; the logic board; the SIM card placeholder. In fact, except for the screen, everything in the phone had to be removed to get at the USB-C port.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iFixit describes this as a “terrible design.” And it’s not like this is a minor issue: the company warns that the port is a frequent point of failure because of the mechanical wear and tear it’s subjected to in normal use. This is a component that frequently needs to be repaired.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In other respects iFixit was impressed by the iPhone 16e. It commended, for example, a new metal housing that protects a flex cable on the back housing and prevents repairers from accidentally severing it when opening up the case from that direction. (The cables connecting the screen are not protected in this way and must be treated with care.) The site concluded that the overall experience had been a positive one–but those issues with the USB-C port mar what could have been a standout performance.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c999df256ce668f9809aa89df959cf8b02258a1e9a34fb2c0ceff9a7d8570beb","category":"Apple"}
