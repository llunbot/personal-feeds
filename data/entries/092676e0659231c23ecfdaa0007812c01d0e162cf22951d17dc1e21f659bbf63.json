Frame tubing, rims, tyres, handlebars, and even saddles – it’s all an in-house affair. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the video above, Bolwell talks through how he got into building penny farthings, why he does it, and just a few of the finer features found in his creations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bolwell’s bikes were previously covered in <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/gallery-the-best-of-the-2021-handmade-bicycle-show-australia-part-three/\" target=\"_blank\">part three</a> of our Handmade Bicycle Show Australia coverage. And if you haven’t already, be sure to check out other instalments in our <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/tag/meet-the-maker/\" target=\"_blank\">Meet the Maker series</a>.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/meet-the-maker-dan-bolwell-of-penny-farthing-dan/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"092676e0659231c23ecfdaa0007812c01d0e162cf22951d17dc1e21f659bbf63","category":"Cycling"}
