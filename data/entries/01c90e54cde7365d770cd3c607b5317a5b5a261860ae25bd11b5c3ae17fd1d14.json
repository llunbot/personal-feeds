At least, not at the Macworld offices. But, they are fantastic devices if you want to keep an eye on your health, be sure not to miss notifications on your iPhone and in the case of the elderly they can also be something of a lifesaver. If you’re thinking of whether to get one of your older family members an Apple Watch, then here’s all you need to know. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do they need an iPhone?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It might seem a basic question, but the Apple Watch isn’t that useful if you give it to someone with an Android phone or even a classic non-smartphone. They only work with iPhones and that’s very likely the way it will stay. So, the most important first question to answer is whether the person in question has an iPhone or not. If they do, great, otherwise we’d recommend looking for one of the alternative smartwatches on our sister-site Tech Advisor’s <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/723389/best-smartwatch.html\">best smartwatch</a> or <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/723392/best-fitness-tracker.html\">best fitness tracker roundups</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, you can set up an Apple Watch on your iPhone and then give it to your elderly relative or friend. The iPhone is required for Apple Watch setup and any subsequent software updates, but beyond that it doesn’t matter. Once the Apple Watch is set up and they are wearing it, you can then use the health monitoring features to ensure they’re safe. Here’s a rundown of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676595/does-an-apple-watch-work-without-an-iphone.html\">all the things an Apple Watch can do without an iPhone</a>. If you do this, you’ll want to ensure the Apple Watch isn’t blasting your relative with all the notifications from your iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about the current range of Apple Watches read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671574/best-apple-watch.html\">guide to the Best Apple Watch</a>. We can also help you save money, read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672795/best-apple-watch-deals.html\">The best Apple Watch deals this month</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why is an Apple Watch good for older people?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the useful ability of not having to keep getting your iPhone out of a bag or pocket when messages come in, an Apple Watch can also be very useful in terms of monitoring the current health of an older person. Some models come with an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232214/how-to-use-the-ecg-feature-on-apple-watch-series-4.html\">ECG sensor</a>, which can detect a specific kind of heart problem or variances that might suggest conditions such as atrial fibrillation. Some have SpO2 sensors to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675099/how-to-measure-blood-oxygen-level-with-apple-watch.html\">measure blood oxygen levels</a>, again this can warn if the wearer is getting into difficulties, potentially due to respiratory problems. There’s also a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673457/how-to-use-fall-detection-on-apple-watch.html\">fall detection</a> feature that can sense when someone takes a tumble and might not be ok–it can even alert the emergency services. You can input important medical information so that it can be displayed on the Watch if required. And if they do need to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672703/how-to-make-an-emergency-call-on-iphone-or-apple-watch.html\">call the emergency services they can do so from an Apple Watch</a> it is easy to do so (if it has cellular connectivity or a nearby iPhone to route via).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also set up the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233398/find-my-how-to-use-apples-new-all-in-one-app-to-find-friends-and-devices.html\">Find My</a> to show you someone’s current location and can be very helpful if the person in question suffers from memory issues and may wander off.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We should note that, in the United States, Apple is currently in the middle of a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2264791/there-may-be-hope-for-apple-watches-sold-with-disabled-blood-oxygen-sensors.html\">patent dispute with a company named Masimo</a> over its implementation of the blood oxygen sensor. All new Apple Watches sold in the U.S., regardless of model, have this functionality disabled. The hardware is still there, and Apple will probably be able to re-enable the feature when the patent dispute is resolved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from these more serious use cases, there’s also the simple truth that as hearing starts to diminish, having a notification come up on your wrist can mean you don’t miss important calls or messages. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which is the best Apple Watch for seniors?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As with most tech purchases, this depends on what you want and the budget you have available. We’d say that unless your family member or friend is the outward-bound type that’s likely to go canoeing through ravines, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1364168/apple-watch-ultra-review.html\">Apple Watch Ultra</a> will be overkill. It’s large, heavy and costs a small fortune. So, here’s our pick of the current crop:</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.
