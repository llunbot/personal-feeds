We're most intimately familiar with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/going-deep-with-the-book-8088-the-brand-new-laptop-that-runs-like-its-1981/\">the Book 8088</a>, a recreation of the original 1981 IBM PC inside a chunky clamshell laptop. The people behind the Book 8088 are also responsible for the Hand386, which is a bit like a late-80s PC stuck inside an old Palm Pilot or Blackberry, and a second revision of the Book 8088 with more built-in ports and a VGA-capable graphics adapter installed instead of a basic CGA adapter.</p>\n\n<p>Whoever is selling these systems is now <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805356267711.html\">back with the Pocket 386</a>, which combines Hand386-style internals with a clamshell design similar to the Book 8088. The result is the kind of IBM-compatible system that would have been common during the Windows 3.1 era, when MS-DOS still dominated (especially for games) but Windows was on the upswing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032811#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032811&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"78941b7d19c462793c9ddaec5a372ed19681f5998a4c16abfca6f7a57c80f649","category":"Tech"}
