These free events are now rolling out worldwide, bringing our cloud computing community together to connect, collaborate, and learn. Whether you prefer joining us online or in-person, these gatherings offer valuable opportunities to expand your AWS knowledge. I will be attending the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fr/events/summits/paris/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=blog\">Summit in Paris</a> this week, the biggest cloud conference in France, and the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/london/\">London Summit</a> at the end of the month. We will have a small podcast recording studio where I will interview French and British customers to produce new episodes for <a href=\"https://developers.podcast.go-aws.com/web/index.html\">the AWS Developers Podcast</a> and <a href=\"https://francais.podcast.go-aws.com/web/index.html\">le podcast <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f399.png\" alt=\"🎙\" /> AWS <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2601.png\" alt=\"☁\" /> en <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1eb-1f1f7.png\" alt=\"🇫🇷\" /></a>.</p> \n<p>Register today!</p> \n<p>But for now, let’s look at last week’s new announcements.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last week’s launches</strong></span><br /> At <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/\">KubeCon London</a>, we introduced <strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/announcing-amazon-eks-community-add-ons-catalog/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=blog\">the EKS Community Add-Ons Catalog</a></strong>, making it simpler for Kubernetes users to enhance their <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/\">Amazon EKS</a> clusters with powerful open-source tools. This catalog streamlines the installation of essential add-ons like <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server\">metrics-server</a>, <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/kube-state-metrics/\">kube-state-metrics</a>, <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/#monitoring-linux-host-metrics-with-the-node-exporter\">prometheus-node-exporter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager\">cert-manager</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns\">external-dns</a>. By integrating these community-driven add-ons directly into the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks\">Amazon EKS console</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS command line interface</a> (AWS CLI), customers can reduce operational complexity and accelerate deployment while maintaining flexibility and security. This launch reflects AWS’s commitment to the Kubernetes community, providing seamless access to trusted open-source solutions without the overhead of manual installation and maintenance.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/accelerate-operational-analytics-with-amazon-q-developer-in-amazon-opensearch-service/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=blog\">Amazon Q Developer now integrates with Amazon OpenSearch Service</a></strong> to enhance operational analytics by enabling natural language exploration and AI-assisted data visualization. This integration simplifies the process of querying and visualizing operational data, reducing the learning curve associated with traditional query languages and tools. During incident responses, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/\">Amazon Q Developer</a> offers contextual summaries and insights directly within the alerts interface, facilitating quicker analysis and resolution. This advancement allows engineers to focus more on innovation by streamlining troubleshooting processes and improving monitoring infrastructure.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-api-gateway-now-supports-dual-stack-ipv4-and-ipv6-endpoints/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=blog\">Amazon API Gateway now supports dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) endpoints</a> </strong>across all endpoint types, custom domains, and management APIs in both commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. This enhancement allows REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs, as well as custom domains, to handle requests from both IPv4 and IPv6 clients, facilitating a smoother transition to IPv6 and addressing IPv4 address scarcity. Additionally, AWS continues its commitment to IPv6 adoption with recent updates, including <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/aws-identity-access-management-dual-stack-ipv4-ipv6-environments/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=blog\">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) introducing dual-stack public endpoints</a> for seamless connections over IPv4 and IPv6 and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/aws-ram-supports-ipv6/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=blog\">AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) enabling customers to manage resource shares using IPv6 addresses</a>. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/04/amazon-security-lake-internet-protocol-version-6/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=blog\">Amazon Security Lake customers can also now use Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) addresses</a> via new dual-stack endpoints to configure and manage the service. These advancements collectively ensure broader compatibility and future-proofing of network infrastructure.</p> \n<p><strong>​<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/04/amazon-ses-attachments-sending-apis/?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=blog\">Amazon SES has introduced support for email attachments in its v2 APIs</a></strong>, enabling users to include files like PDFs and images directly in their emails without manually constructing MIME messages. This enhancement simplifies the process of sending rich email content and reduces implementation complexity. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ses/\">Amazon Simple Email Service</a> (Amazon SES) supports attachments in all AWS Regions where the service is available.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/04/amazon-neptune-99-99-availability-service-level-agreement/\">Amazon Neptune has updated its Service Level Agreement (SLA) to offer a 99.99% Monthly Uptime Percentage</a></strong> for Multi-AZ DB Instance, Multi-AZ DB Cluster, and Multi-AZ Graph configurations, up from the previous 99.9%. This enhancement demonstrates the commitment AWS has to providing highly available and reliable graph database services for mission-critical applications. The improved SLA is now available in all AWS Regions where <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/\">Amazon Neptune</a> is offered.</p> \n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a> \n<p><span><strong>Other AWS events</strong></span><br /> Check your calendar and sign up for upcoming AWS events.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/startups/lp/aws-gen-ai-lofts?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&amp;sc_channel=blog\">AWS GenAI Lofts</a> are collaborative spaces and immersive experiences that showcase AWS expertise in cloud computing and AI.
