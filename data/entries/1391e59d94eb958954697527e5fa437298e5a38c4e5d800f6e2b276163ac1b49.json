However, we have not confirmed if this change has been finalized for the update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-18-Control-Center-Feature-Iridescent-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe new Control Center would feature a drag-and-drop system that allows at least some of the controls to be reorganized on the screen, our sources said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf this plan moves forward, it would represent the biggest redesign to Control Center since iOS 11 was released in 2017. On the iPhone X and newer, the menu can be opened by swiping down from the top-right corner of the screen, providing controls for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, display brightness, volume, and many other system functions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe'll find out if the redesigned Control Center is happening in just days from now, as Apple is set to unveil iOS 18 during its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/\">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>. The first beta of iOS 18 will likely be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately following the keynote, and the update should be widely released in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/control-center/\">Control Center</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/05/ios-18-rumor-customizable-control-center/\">iOS 18 Rumor: Redesigned Control Center With Customizable Layout</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-rumor-redesigned-control-center-with-customizable-layout.2428189/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1391e59d94eb958954697527e5fa437298e5a38c4e5d800f6e2b276163ac1b49","category":"Apple"}
