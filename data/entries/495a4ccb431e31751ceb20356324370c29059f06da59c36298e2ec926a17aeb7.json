The Norco DH team rode them all week and for the finals, The Santa Cruz Syndicate used them for the beginning of the week but not at the final because course conditions had improved.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-13.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-13.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype maxxis high roller 3 downhill mountain bike tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-13.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-13-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-13-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-13-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-13-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Watermarked photos ©Bikerumor / Jordan Villella</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Photos were hard to come by, hence the weird angles and cropping, but here’s what we can tell so far…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-12.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-12.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype maxxis high roller 3 downhill mountain bike tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-12.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-12-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-12-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-12-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-12-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First, it looks like a much more aggressive tire than the High Roller II, which could mean that both are staying in the line. This prototype’s center blocks are more square, whereas the HRII has wider, rectangular knobs. Here it is for reference:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2221\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire.jpg\" alt=\"maxxis high roller 2 mountain bike tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire.jpg 2221w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire-297x267.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire-800x720.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire-120x108.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire-768x692.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire-1536x1383.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/maxxishigh-roller-2-mtb-tire-2048x1844.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Maxxis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The other big difference is the leading edge. The HRII’s center treads are ramped with a long slope, helping it roll quickly. The side knobs are tall and angular, which makes this one a great rear tire when paired with something more aggressive in the front.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-10.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-10.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype maxxis high roller 3 downhill mountain bike tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-10.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-10-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-10-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-10-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-10-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both have flat backs on the knobs for good braking traction. This HRIII prototype’s side knobs are straighter, with edges running parallel to the rolling direction rather than at slight and alternating angles like the  HRII.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-7.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype maxxis high roller 3 downhill mountain bike tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-7.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-7-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-7-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-7-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-7-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-3.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype maxxis high roller 3 downhill mountain bike tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-3.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-3-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-3-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-3-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-3-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The center blocks also stay in line with each other rather than the HRII’s alternating wide/small pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both have wide open spacing between the knobs, suggesting this HRIII is also intended for loose conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-11.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-11.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of prototype maxxis high roller 3 downhill mountain bike tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-11.jpg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-11-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-11-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-11-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prototype-maxxis-high-roller-3-DH-mountain-bike-tire-11-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No word on specs yet, but we suspect it’ll have the same DoubleDown and Downhill casing options as the HRII. It’ll likely also get various single, double, 3C MaxxTerra, MaxxGrip, and SuperTacky compound options, too. Why? Because we could see this pairing really well with the HRII as a front/rear combo. That said, the Minion DHR II tire has a similar tread pattern to the High Roller II, so perhaps this one’s intentionally different to help give it it’s own personality and position in their lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.maxxis.com\" target=\"_blank\">Maxxis.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/spotted-maxxis-high-roller-iii-makes-the-dh-rounds/\">Spotted!
