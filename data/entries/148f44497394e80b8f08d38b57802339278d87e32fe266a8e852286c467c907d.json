Accordingly, Apple has released its <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUVQ3AM/A/usb-c-to-magsafe-3-cable-2-m-space-black\">USB-C to MagSafe 3 cable in Space Black</a> for $49.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/MacBook-Pro-Space-Black-Topdown-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple already includes a color-matched MagSafe 3 charging cable in the box with the new MacBook Pro models, but the cable can be ordered individually from Apple's online store for those who want an extra one or need a replacement. The cable also remains available in Space Gray, Midnight, Starlight, and Silver.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe cable is also compatible with 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M2 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMagSafe technology allows the cable to magnetically attach to a MacBook. If someone trips on the cable, it releases so that the MacBook does not go tumbling. The cable is two meters long and features a woven design for added durability.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/usb-c-to-magsafe-3-cable-space-black/\">Apple's USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable Now Available to Order in Space Black</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-usb-c-to-magsafe-3-cable-now-available-to-order-in-space-black.2409262/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"148f44497394e80b8f08d38b57802339278d87e32fe266a8e852286c467c907d","category":"Apple"}
