Apple even showed off an image of mail categorization on the Mac last year, but it has yet to arrive.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe upgraded Mail app automatically sorts emails into Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions categories, but not everyone loves this new functionality, and fortunately it can be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-disable-apple-mail-categories/\">turned off on the iPhone if desired</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMail categorization is currently only available in English. While the feature relies on on-device artificial intelligence, the redesigned Mail app does not require a device with Apple Intelligence support. For example, mail categorization is available on all iPhone models that are compatible with iOS 18.2, going back to the iPhone XS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe redesigned Mail app is also coming to the iPad, <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1881074260590108987\">according to Gurman</a>. No word on timing, but perhaps it will arrive with iPadOS 18.4.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-mail/\">Apple Mail</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/19/apple-mail-categories-coming-to-mac/\">Apple's Redesigned Mail App is Expanding to the Mac — Here's When</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-redesigned-mail-app-is-expanding-to-the-mac-—-heres-when.2447703/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ba5ec86ce9a1a0543ffaf02f4da2e9197e4725f7d321b4887d1033bcce04e266","category":"Apple"}
