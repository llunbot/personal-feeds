While the concept has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/everyone-pitching-the-metaverse-has-a-different-idea-of-what-it-is/\">many meanings</a>, to Zuckerberg, it’s an “even more immersive and embodied Internet” where users can meet with friends, connect with colleagues, shop for goods and services, and so on. In other words, Zuckerberg wants to take people’s lives and put them inside a metaverse, preferably one he controls.</p>\n<p>To Haugen, that’s a red flag. “Facebook should have a transparency plan for the metaverse before they start building all this stuff because they’ve demonstrated with regard to Facebook that they can hide behind a wall, they keep making unforced errors, they keep making things that prioritize their own profits over our safety,” she <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-lifestyle-business-only-on-ap-media-e4f03d38243552e46a77d0d3f0d45e3b\">said</a> in an interview with the Associated Press.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811526#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811526&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8fc6005e6cb09689dbe1634d595c70c8da625823e5590bbdc9f79d0f321612fc","category":"Tech"}
