{"title":"MacRumors Giveaway: Win an Apple Watch Ultra 2 From GRID Studio","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/macrumors-giveaway-grid-studio-apple-watch-may/","date":1747417196000,"content":"For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href=\"https://www.gridstudio.cc/\">GRID Studio</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. GRID Studio is known for taking non-operational Apple devices that would be cluttering up a landfill and turning them into <a href=\"https://www.gridstudio.cc/collections/all\">stylish art for Apple fans</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/grid-studio-iphone-2g.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nGRID Studio takes apart iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple accessories, cleverly displaying each component to provide a look inside Apple's most iconic products. The pieces are arranged in a frame and accompanied by labels and little tidbits of Apple history.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe company is offering a flash sale this weekend, with up to 50 percent off a range of products. The GRID 1, featuring the <a href=\"https://www.gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation\">well-known first-generation iPhone</a>, for example, is available for $299, which is a $100 discount off of the typical price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe original <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> is one of Apple's most recognizable devices, and it is the ideal piece to get because it was such an important part of Apple's history. The GRID 1 features all of the internal components from the first ‌iPhone‌, from the home button to the chassis.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor something more affordable, the <a href=\"https://www.gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-6plus\">GRID 6 Plus</a>, featuring the ‌iPhone‌ 6 Plus, is just $99 during the sale. The ‌iPhone‌ 6 Plus was Apple's first larger-sized ‌iPhone‌, sold alongside the ‌iPhone‌ 6. It is perhaps best known for being the subject of the major \"bendgate\" controversy because the chassis could become distorted in a pocket.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/grid-studio-iphone-6-plus.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe GRID 13, <a href=\"https://www.gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-13\">available for $179</a>, features Apple's more modern ‌iPhone‌ 13. The GRID 13 shows off the newer, flat-edged chassis that Apple introduced with the ‌iPhone‌ 12, a logic board with the A15 chip, and a range of components like the Taptic Engine and the TrueDepth camera system.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/grid-studio-iphone-13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nGRID Studio does accessories too, such as the Magic Mouse. A disassembled version of the Magic Mouse <a href=\"https://www.gridstudio.cc/products/grid-magic-mouse\">is on sale for $99</a>, and it feature's Apple's love it or hate it mouse design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/grid-studio-magic-mouse.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nWe have an (assembled and functional) ‌Apple Watch Ultra 2‌ from GRID Studio to give away to one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
