{"title":"Secretive U.S. Surveillance Program Gives Cops Access to Trillions of U.S. Phone Records","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/hemisphere-das-white-house-surveillance-trillions-us-call-records/","date":1700604700000,"content":"\n<p>Dell Cameron and Dhruv Mehrotra, reporting for Wired:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A little-known surveillance program tracks more than a trillion \ndomestic phone records within the United States each year, \naccording to a letter Wired obtained that was sent by US senator \nRon Wyden to the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Sunday, \nchallenging the program’s legality.</p>\n\n<p>According to the letter, a surveillance program now known as Data \nAnalytical Services (DAS) has for more than a decade allowed \nfederal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to mine the \ndetails of Americans’ calls, analyzing the phone records of \ncountless people who are not suspected of any crime, including \nvictims. Using a technique known as chain analysis, the program \ntargets not only those in direct phone contact with a criminal \nsuspect but anyone with whom those individuals have been in \ncontact as well.</p>\n\n<p>The DAS program, formerly known as Hemisphere, is run in \ncoordination with the telecom giant AT&amp;T, which captures and \nconducts analysis of US call records for law enforcement agencies, \nfrom local police and sheriffs’ departments to US customs offices \nand postal inspectors across the country, according to a White \nHouse memo reviewed by Wired. Records show that the White House \nhas, for the past decade, provided more than $6 million to the \nprogram, which allows the targeting of the records of any calls \nthat use AT&amp;T’s infrastructure — a maze of routers and switches \nthat crisscross the United States. </p>\n\n<p>In a letter to US attorney general Merrick Garland on Sunday, \nWyden wrote that he had “serious concerns about the legality” of \nthe DAS program, adding that “troubling information” he’d received \n“would justifiably outrage many Americans and other members of \nCongress.” That information, which Wyden says the DOJ \nconfidentially provided to him, is considered “sensitive but \nunclassified” by the US government, meaning that while it poses no \nrisk to national security, federal officials, like Wyden, are \nforbidden from disclosing it to the public, according to the \nsenator’s letter. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ron Wyden and his office are <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/wyden\">indispensable</a> on matters related to government surveillance. A few non-obvious aspects worth considering regarding the DAS/Hemisphere program:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The information collected by DAS <a href=\"https://epic.org/documents/fact-sheet-data-analytical-services-das-program-formerly-known-as-hemisphere/\">includes location data</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>This is <em>not</em> just about AT&amp;T wireless customers and their phone calls. This is related to the entire U.S. phone system infrastructure — the old Ma Bell. Landline calls and calls from Verizon and T-Mobile cellular customers get routed through this AT&amp;T system, and are thus surveilled by this same system. You can use over-the-top services like iMessage, FaceTime, WhatsApp, or Signal to avoid DAS, but if you place calls using the traditional phone system, you could be impacted even if you’re not an AT&amp;T customer — and you won’t ever know, because you have no idea how your phone calls are routed.</p></li>\n<li><p>It is completely unclear to me whether DAS/Hemisphere collects text messages — SMS, MMS, RCS — in addition to voice calls. I’ve spent my afternoon trying to find out, and the only answer I’ve gotten is it’s unclear. I hope text messages are <em>not</em> included, but until we get a definitive answer, it’s only safe to assume that text messages <em>are</em> included. (If anyone reading this knows whether DAS includes text message records, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/contact/\">please let me know</a>.)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/21/das-secret-phone-record-program\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2566802e5b9cd6b6f6f9e54aebf67ea9a3f0c27f86ff36d646cac5b3a07e9387","category":"Tech"}
