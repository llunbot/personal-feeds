Before we get into how it works, we wanted to know <em>why</em> Hope thought a new clipless mechanism was necessary.</p><p><em>“We didn’t set out to develop a new system but it naturally developed this way. We have made flat pedals for a number of years but the majority of us at the factory ride clips so it seemed a shame we couldn’t use our own pedals. Basically, we wanted to stick a clip mechanism on an F20. When we looked at our options the only existing system available to us would be based on a Shimano SPD, however this system doesn’t work too well when used with a big platform, it needs clearance meaning most of the platform would be wasted. We made some prototypes of our own mechanism which solved some of the issues and it worked pretty well first time so that gave us confidence to develop it further and see where it took us”</em> – Sam Gibbs, Hope Technology’s designer of the Union Pedals.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking.jpg\" alt=\"hope union tc mtb pedal red cr-mo axle 4 pins each side\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073853/hope-union-trail-clipless-pedal-mountain-biking-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a>The new mechanism design aims to provide easy pedal entry combined with secure cleat holding and positive release characteristics. The dual clip mechanism means the front clip can move on pedal entry to reduce the effort required to clip into the pedal. It also flattens the entry angle of the shoe, giving a wider cleat acceptance angle and allowing the front of the shoe sole to run closer to the pedal body for increased stability. Cleat release is driven off fixed pins for a positive and consistent release.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black.jpg\" alt=\"hope union gc pedal downhill enduro aggressive riding large platform 7 pins per side\" width=\"1200\" height=\"835\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-297x207.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-800x557.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-120x84.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-768x534.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-696x484.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-1068x743.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-604x420.jpg 604w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-100x70.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-297x207.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-800x557.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-120x84.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-768x534.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-696x484.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-1068x743.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-604x420.jpg 604w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30073841/hope-union-gravity-clipless-pedal-downhill-enduro-mtb-black-100x70.jpg 100w\"></a></p><p>The Union Pedal bodies are CNC machined from billet.

The Number 4 cleat gives 4° of free float (the amount of angular float before the cleat starts to disengage with the mechanism) and has a 12° release angle. The Number 5 cleat gives 5° of free float and has a 13° release angle. It also requires more effort to release, suited to more aggressive riding. Both cleats also allow 2mm of lateral (side to side) float.</p><p>The Hope Union Race, Trail and Gravity clipless pedals all run the same internals as Hope’s F20 flat pedal. That’s three cartridge bearings and a norglide bush for smooth long term durability. Axle service kits are available at £16.75 per pedal.</p><h3>What MTB Shoes do the Hope Union Pedals work with?</h3><p>We asked designer Sam Gibbs, exactly that. He shied away from mentioning any particular brands, but he did tells us the Hope Union Clipless Pedals are optimised to work with a 7mm deep cleat box, stating that “any shoe around this number will work nicely without cleat shims or spacers on the pedal itself”.&nbsp;</p><p>Shoes with a deeper cleat box would need shims under the cleats; these are provided with the pedals. On the other hand, shoes with a shallower cleat box would need the pedal pins to be made taller with spacers (also provided) to get contact with the shoe sole.</p><h4>Union Race Clip</h4><figure id=\"attachment_266968\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266968\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding.jpg\" alt=\"hope union rc xc mtb pedals\" width=\"1200\" height=\"494\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding-297x122.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding-800x329.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding-120x49.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding-768x316.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding-696x287.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding-1068x440.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding-1020x420.jpg 1020w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding-297x122.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding-800x329.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding-120x49.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding-768x316.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding-696x287.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding-1068x440.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/30075727/hope-race-clip-union-pedals-xc-endurance-mtb-riding-1020x420.jpg 1020w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-266968\">The Hope Union Race clip has the following dimensions: 63mm Wide x 44mm Long</figcaption></figure><p>The Hope Union RC is the smallest, most lightweight of the three models, and runs a titanium axle as standard.
