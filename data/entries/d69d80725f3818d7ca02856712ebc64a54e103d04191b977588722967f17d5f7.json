You can use this increased performance to process data faster, consolidate workloads, and lower the cost of ownership.</p> \n<p>C7a instances oﬀer up to 50 percent higher performance compared to C6a instances. These instances are ideal for running compute-intensive workloads such as high-performance web servers, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/batch\">batch processing</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/advertising-marketing/advertising-technology/\">ad serving</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/\">machine learning</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/gaming\">multiplayer gaming</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/media/tech/accelerated-video-transcoding/\">video encoding</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc\">high performance computing (HPC)</a> such as scientific modeling, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/\">machine learning</a>.</p> \n<p>C7a instances support <a href=\"https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/x86/avx512_vnni\">AVX-512, Vector Neural Network Instructions</a> (VNNI), and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format\">brain floating point</a> (bfloat16). These instances feature Double Data Rate 5 (DDR5) memory, which enables high-speed access to data in-memory, and deliver 2.25 times more memory bandwidth compared to the previous generation instances for lower latency.</p> \n<p>C7a instances feature sizes of up to 192 vCPUs with 384 GiB RAM, which you have a new medium instance size, which enables you to right-size your workloads more accurately, offering 1 vCPU, 2 GiB. Here are the detailed specs:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Name</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>vCPUs</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Memory (GiB)</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Network Bandwidth (Gbps)</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>EBS Bandwidth (Gbps)</strong></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7a.medium</strong></td> \n   <td>1</td> \n   <td>2</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7a.large</strong></td> \n   <td>2</td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7a.xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7a.2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7a.4xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7a.8xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>12.5</td> \n   <td>10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7a.12xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>48</td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>18.75</td> \n   <td>15</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7a.16xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>25</td> \n   <td>20</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7a.24xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>37.5</td> \n   <td>30</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7a.32xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>256</td> \n   <td>50</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7a.48xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>384</td> \n   <td>50</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c7a.metal-48xl</strong></td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>384</td> \n   <td>50</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>C7a instances have up to 50 Gbps enhanced networking and 40 Gbps EBS bandwidth, and you can attach up to 128 EBS volumes to an instance, compared to up to 28 EBS volume attachments with the previous generation instances.</p> \n<p>C7a instances support always-on memory encryption with AMD secure memory encryption (SME) and new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions\">AVX-512 instructions</a> for accelerating encryption and decryption algorithms, convolutional neural network (CNN) based algorithms, financial analytics, and video encoding workloads. C7a instances also support AES-256 compared to AES-128 in C6a instances for enhanced security.</p> \n<p>These instances are built on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/\">AWS Nitro System</a> and support <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/\">Elastic Fabric Adapter</a> (EFA) for workloads that benefit from lower network latency and highly scalable inter-node communication, such as high-performance computing and video processing.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Now Available</u></strong><br /> Amazon EC2 C7a instances are now available in the following AWS Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland). As usual with Amazon EC2, you only pay for what you use.
