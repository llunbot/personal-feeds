OpenAI revealed the collaboration during an interview with the news outlet at the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2024/\">World Economic Forum</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davos\">Davos</a>. The AI company recently modified its policies, allowing for certain military applications of its technology, while maintaining prohibitions against using it to develop weapons.</p>\n<p>According to Anna Makanju, OpenAI's vice president of global affairs, \"many people thought that [a previous blanket prohibition on military applications] would prohibit many of these use cases, which people think are very much aligned with what we want to see in the world.\" OpenAI removed terms from its service agreement that <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240110075746/https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies\">previously blocked</a> AI use in \"military and warfare\" situations, but the company still upholds a ban on its technology being used to develop weapons or to cause harm or property damage.</p>\n\n<p>Under the \"Universal Policies\" section of OpenAI's <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies\">Usage Policies</a> document, section 2 says, \"Don't use our service to harm yourself or others.\" The prohibition includes using its AI products to \"develop or use weapons.\" Changes to the terms that removed the \"military and warfare\" prohibitions appear to have been made by OpenAI on January 10.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996787#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996787&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b2a905cf3ec444938eccf824fc90bd3692c5570b451e80fa67cb1f40ad236bc4","category":"Tech"}
