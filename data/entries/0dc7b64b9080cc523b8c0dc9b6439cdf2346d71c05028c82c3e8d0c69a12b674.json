And after three years of always doing the Tour and Vuelta, it’s good to change things up.”</p>\n<p><strong>Also read:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.velonews.com/news/road/sepp-kuss-sees-surprise-call-up-to-ride-giro-ditalia-alongside-primoz-roglic/\">Kuss to return to Giro in surprise calendar shakeup</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.velonews.com/news/sepp-kuss-not-wearied-by-worldtour-toil-i-still-just-love-the-riding/\">Kuss not wearied by WorldTour toil: ‘I still just love the riding’</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When Jumbo-Visma’s GC contender and domestique <em>de luxe</em> Wilco Kelderman crashed out of Tirreno-Adriatico and lost weeks of training time, it was super-climber Kuss that was top of the team’s list of beyond-category wingmen for Roglič at the “corsa rosa.”</p>\n<p>Next month’s Italian tour will mark both Kuss and Roglič’s first Giro in four years, and a continuation of the twosome’s long racing relationship.</p>\n<p>Kuss and Roglič will be at the center of Jumbo-Visma’s ambition to win its first <em>maglia rosa</em> next month.</p>\n<p>The powerhouse team faces some of the fiercest possible opposition in its Italian quest to claim a fifth grand tour in five years – the Belgian wreckin’ ball that is <a href=\"https://www.velonews.com/tag/remco-evenepoel/\">Remco Evenepoel</a>.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of motivation for the team, and for me, at the Giro,” Kuss said in a call to Tenerife’s Parador hotel last week.</p>\n<p>“Going there with Primož, we know we have a guy that’s going to be fighting for the win. I think that brings out all the best in all of us that are there to support him. Especially when we know we’re going against a guy as strong as Remco.”</p>\n<h2>Putting training on fast-forward on the flanks of Teide</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.velonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1249273836-720x480.jpg?width=720\" alt width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /><figcaption><span>Kuss only raced though the UAE and Catalan tours this year after expecting a long build to the Tour de France.

So now with the Giro, I had to accelerate the training quite a bit,” he said.</p>\n<p>“It was a shock at first getting into it, but I feel good now.”</p>\n<p>Kuss already raced the UAE and Catalunya tours this year and had been initially slated to start this week’s Tour de Romandie.</p>\n<p>With the Giro now on his schedule, he’s instead pedaling through a grand tour workload on Teide with his Giro-bound teammates.</p>\n<p>The 28-year-old so far amassed around 2,100km and 47,000m vert into the past two-and-a-half weeks of high-altitude training.</p>\n<p>“I already feel good, and it’s motivating when you can go to a race and know you’re well prepared,” he said. “For me, mentally I want to be able to go to a race and know I can give my best. So far from this camp, I feel I’m getting to that point.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CrPx7zXNhzq/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <p></p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p></p></a><p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CrPx7zXNhzq/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Robert Gesink (@robertgesink)</a></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A grand tour triple? ‘Anything is possible’</h2>\n<p>Kuss has been an integral part of Jumbo-Visma’s grand tour plans since he joined the team in 2018.</p>\n<p>He helped Roglič to what was a breakout podium finish at the 2019 Giro, partnered the Slovenian through his three Vuelta a España victories, and helped Jonas Vingegaard secure Jumbo-Visma’s first Tour de France title last summer.</p>\n<p>“I guess I see it as a good sign the team called on me first,” he joked about his Giro surprise. “It’s always motivating to be given that confidence.”</p>\n<p>Kuss remains on Jumbo-Visma’s long list for the Tour and seems a shoo-in for the team’s yellow jersey defense.</p>\n<p>But the Vuelta?</p>\n<p>It’s a race Kuss relishes as his adopted “home” grand tour and one he feels brings him to his best.</p>\n<p>“I always like doing the Vuelta, and I always feel like I go well there with that weather and being later in the season,” he said.</p>\n<p>“This year, there’s quite a lot of time in between each grand tour. On paper, anything is possible,” Kuss said of a grand tour triple. “I just have to approach it one race at a time.”</p>\n<h2>‘Evenepoel is a huge rival’</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.velonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1248888018-720x480.jpg?width=720\" alt width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /><figcaption><span>Roglič and Evenepoel were near-inseperable at the Volta a Catalunya and are set to headline the Giro.

A “W” in Italy could see the Durangan become one of a small band of active riders to claim victory across all three grand tours.</p>\n<p>But Kuss knows his attention will be elsewhere as he helps Roglič beat back Evenepoel, who will land into Italy roaring hot after his steamrollering Liège-Bastogne-Liège defense.</p>\n<p>“Remco’s a huge rival,” Kuss said. “But there are always other guys that can surprise you. You can’t discount anybody.”</p>\n<p>Evenepoel and Roglič will line up as joint favorites for the pink jersey in a field flooded with outsiders like Tao Geoghegan Hart, Alexander Vlasov, and João Almeida.</p>\n<p>But Jumbo-Visma knows who it will have to watch closest after Roglič and Kuss only narrowly bettered Quick-Step’s bombastic Belgian at the Tour of Catalunya last month.</p>\n<p>“From the races he’s done so far, Remco seems to be a notch above the other guys,” Kuss said. “For sure, Remco is going to be a big, big opponent.”</p>\n<p>With Evenepoel looking almost unstoppable, Roglič will no doubt be glad to see climber king Kuss at his side next month.</p>","author":"VeloNews.com","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"0dc7b64b9080cc523b8c0dc9b6439cdf2346d71c05028c82c3e8d0c69a12b674","category":"Cycling"}
