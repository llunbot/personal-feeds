The solutions are always electric, and they're also tiny. What most companies (bar Citroen, Renault, and Fiat) seem to have forgotten is that we've had an answer to this problem all along: the microcar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/05/microcar-madness-at-the-lane-motor-museum/\">The microcar is a singular little thing</a>—its job is to frugally take one person (or maybe two people) where they need to go while taking up as little space as possible.

And do they have a future?</p>\n<p>Well, without the microcar's predecessors, we may not have the modern motorcar as we know it.
