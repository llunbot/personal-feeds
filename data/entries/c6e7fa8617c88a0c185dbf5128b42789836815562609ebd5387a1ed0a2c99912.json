The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display delivers vivid colors and 500 nits of brightness. The M2 chip makes this laptop a fantastic companion for whatever you need to do, while the 18-hour battery life is also a major part of why we love this particular MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a laptop we loved in 2022, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\">giving it a 4.5-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award</a>, and not much has changed since then. We still love its gorgeous display and thin bezels as well as the excellent keyboard with a full-size row of function keys, which is always useful to have. “For most of us, the new M2 MacBook Air is all the laptop we’ll ever need. Unless you do some seriously high-end video editing or other computationally intensive work all the time, you have no need for a MacBook Pro,” our review notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was at full price with just 8GB of RAM. Now the M2 MacBook Air starts at $999 with 16GB of RAM, which would have cost $1,399 back then. At its sale price of $799, you’re basically saving $600 on a laptop that punches well above its class.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t miss out on getting your very own <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHCWH55?th=1\">M2 MacBook Air for just $799 at Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHCWH55?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c6e7fa8617c88a0c185dbf5128b42789836815562609ebd5387a1ed0a2c99912","category":"Apple"}
