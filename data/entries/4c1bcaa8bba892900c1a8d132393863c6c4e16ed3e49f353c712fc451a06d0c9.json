Alongside <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-gravel-bikes/\">electric gravel bikes,</a> electric road bikes are increasingly popular and, in some cases, look very similar to non-motorised machines.</p>\n<p>A road ebike will have drop handlebars and a more sporty riding position than a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hybrid-bikes/\">hybrid</a> – just like a conventional, non-assisted <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bike</a>.</p>\n<p>You’ll get the gear range to ride faster and to tackle hills, plus narrower <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">road bike tyres</a> for more rapid progress on the road.</p>\n<p>As with any road bike, reducing weight is important, although not usually at the expense of battery capacity and range. Electric road bikes will always be heavier than their conventional counterparts.</p>\n<p>However, some road ebikes will have carbon-fibre frames and lightweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-wheels/\">wheelsets</a>, bringing their weight down to under 12kg – not a lot more than some unpowered bikes.</p>\n<p>A road ebike’s handling will also be tuned for a sporty ride, so you can enjoy fast descents, while still getting a helping hand from the motor on the uphills.</p>\n<p>As with any <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electric-bike-motors/\">electric bike motor</a>, an e-road bike’s electric assistance will be limited to speeds below 15mph/25kph as per <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electric-bike-laws/\">electric bike laws</a> in the UK, EU and Australia. The limit is 20mph in the US. That’s more than enough for climbing – you’ll be able to climb much quicker than on a regular road bike – but could limit an e-road bike’s appeal on flat roads if riding in a fast group, for example.</p>\n<p>For more advice on what to look for in an electric road bike, our full buyer’s guide is at the bottom of this article, while we’ve also got a separate guide to electric bike types to help you choose the right motorised machine for you.</p>\n\n<h2>The best electric road bikes in 2023</h2>\n<h3>Scott Addict eRide Premium</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Scott Addict eRide Premium offers the sleek looks of a regular road bike and a ride to match.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£8,349 / $9,299 as tested</li>\n<li>1,040g claimed frame weight</li>\n<li>The looks of a normal road bike</li>\n<li>Rides like a non-assisted bike too</li>\n</ul><p>Scott’s Addict eRide borrows heavily from the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/scott-addict-rc-disc/\">Addict RC aero lightweight bike</a>, with similar geometry and Scott’s top-spec HMX carbon.</p>\n<p>It’s powered by the Mahle ebikemotion rear-hub motor, with its fully enclosed battery in the down tube, for a really clean look.</p>\n<p>Power assistance is smooth, both in delivery and when it cuts out, so that you’re supported as you ride, rather than the motor taking over.</p>\n<p>The eRide is available in a range of builds.

The result is unobtrusive power delivery with a feel that puts you in control rather than letting the bike take over.</p>\n<p>We’d rather see tyres larger than the 28mm specced as standard, particularly seeing as this frame can accept 35mm tyres without issue, making it a great option for year-round riding or dabbling in light gravel.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/focus-paralane2-9-7-review/\">Read our full Focus Paralane² 9.7 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Orbea Gain Carbon M20 MyO</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Orbea’s Gain electric road bike is available in carbon or aluminium.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robert Smith</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£4,718 as tested, now £4,699 / $5,599 / AU$9,699</li>\n<li>Electric bike packaged with road bike looks</li>\n<li>ebikemotion hub-based motor</li>\n<li>New 2021 models offer significant updates</li>\n</ul><p>When it was announced, the Orbea Gain was one of a host of refined electric road bikes that eschewed the bulky ebike looks in favour of something more streamlined.</p>\n<p>Built for a group test we conducted last year, our luxuriously kitted out Orbea Gain Carbon M20 was configured using Orbea’s MyO custom builder programme.

That can lead to a bike that at first glance is hard to distinguish from a conventional road bike.</p>\n<p>Fazua and ebikemotion motors are a popular choice seen on many e-road bikes thanks to the progressive power delivery well-suited to road riding, although Bosch units and own-brand motors from the likes of Specialized can also cut a minimalist silhouette.</p>\n<h3>Electric road bike batteries explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Top-tube mounted buttons like this are common on e-road bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Most electric road bikes have a battery enclosed in the bike’s down tube. Again, that leads to an unobtrusive look. In the case of Fazua, you can drop the battery pack out of the down tube for recharging, or remove it to take it indoors closer to an electric plug. You can even remove it completely and ride the electric bike like a non-assisted road bike.</p>\n<p>Other batteries such as ebikemotion’s are more firmly lodged in place, though, so you need to be able to get the bike to a socket to add some juice.</p>\n<p>Typical battery capacities are around 250W/h – usually enough for 60km or so of range, although you should be able to get more than that on flatter ground with judicious use.</p>\n<h3>How much does an electric road bike weigh?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Electric road bikes undoubtedly make climbing a faster affair, but the added weight can be a hindrance when riding fast on flat roads.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<p>The lightest electric road bikes tip the scales at 12kg or less, which isn’t a lot more than some unpowered bikes. That’s achieved by having a frame and fork made of carbon fibre, often accompanied by carbon-rimmed wheels. That tends to be a pricey menu.</p>\n<p>Weight is important, though. On the flat, many road riders will be managing over the 15mph/25kph legal limit (or 20mph in the US) at which the motor cuts out, making the motor and battery a dead weight above those speeds. Keeping the bike’s weight low will make riding without assistance easier, adding to performance and enjoyment.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a more robust, heavier build could be an advantage if you’re aiming to mix in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advertising-feature/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel riding</a>. Weight is also less of an issue if you plan to predominantly ride within the legal limit for motor assistance.</p>\n<h3>Electric road bike wheels and tyres</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Just because a bike’s battery-powered, doesn’t mean the finishing kit has to be sub-par.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott Sports</i></span></div>\n<p>With more power delivered to the road and a heavier bike weight, electric road bikes tend to have wider tyres than standard road bikes. Many pair that with beefed-up wheels with alloy rims, although higher-spec models may come with aero carbon hoops.</p>\n<p>Tyre width on electric road bikes tends to start at 28mm. That’s not unusual on a pedal-powered road bike now though, and provides a more comfortable ride, with additional versatility for rough roads or dabbling on light off-road trails.</p>\n<h2>Can you convert a road bike to an electric road bike?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s nothing stopping you from converting a road bike to an ebike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Swytch</i></span></div>\n<p>While less common than, say, an electric hybrid conversion, it is perfectly possible to convert your road bike to an ebike.</p>\n<p>Check out our in-depth guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bike-conversion-kits/\">how to convert a bike to electric power</a> for more info.</p>\n<p> </p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"4c1bcaa8bba892900c1a8d132393863c6c4e16ed3e49f353c712fc451a06d0c9","category":"Cycling"}
