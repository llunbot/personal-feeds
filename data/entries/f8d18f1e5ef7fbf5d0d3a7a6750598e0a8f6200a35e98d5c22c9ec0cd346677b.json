Billed as ‘the ultimate demonstration of what the human body can do’, the Enhanced Games seeks in part to answer that age old pub question, ‘What if athletes were allowed to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/doping-cycling\">dope</a>, how much better would they be?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a divisive topic unlike any other in sport, but having secured funding – including from Donald Trump Jnr – D’Souza and his team are confident the first edition of the Enhanced Games will run within the next two years, and in so doing will change not just sport but humanity itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the Olympics, athletes will be directly paid to participate and will receive bonuses for breaking records, and thus the edges of human limits will be smashed through. There’ll be input from pharmaceutical companies, profits will be recycled into the research of newer drugs to push boundaries ever further, and the trickle-down effect will be that one day, that drug you saw on TV that helped that 69-year-old woman run a sub-10 second 100m will be available to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it madness or is this the future? Have a listen and make your own mind up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview begins at 10:45</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/cyclist-magazine-podcast/episodes/126-the-doping-olympics-president-of-the-enhanced-games-dr-a\" target=\"_blank\">Aron D’Souza on the Cyclist Magazine Podcast now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Did you know Cyclist is also stunning monthly print magazine?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Subscribe now at <a href=\"http://store.cyclist.co.uk/cycpod\" target=\"_blank\">store.cyclist.co.uk/cycpod</a> and get every issue for less than in the shops, delivered straight to your door.</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/phil-burt-bike-fit-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast: Phil Burt, the king of bike fit</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/juan-dual-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast: The ultra-cyclist missing half his organs, Juan Dual</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/lael-wilcox-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast: Lael Wilcox, the fastest woman around the world by bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/michael-crawley-endurance-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast: Why we do it? with Dr Michael Crawley</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/enhanced-games-cycling\">What if doping were completely legal?
