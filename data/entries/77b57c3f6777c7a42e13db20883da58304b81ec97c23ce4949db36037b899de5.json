{"title":"Samsung reveals the super-slim Galaxy S25 Edge with a laughably small battery","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/form-over-function-samsung-unveils-the-super-slim-galaxy-s25-edge/","date":1747149283000,"content":"<p>Samsung released its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/samsungs-galaxy-s25-event-was-an-ai-presentation-with-occasional-phone-hardware/\">Galaxy S25 series</a> earlier this year to generally favorable reviews. It also teased the perplexingly thin S25 Edge, and now that phone is a reality. You can preorder Samsung's thinnest smartphone-ever today, but you should know what you're getting into. This $1,099 smartphone is incredibly slim, at just 5.8 mm, but it also steps down in the camera department and packs an anemic battery that may struggle to last all day.</p>\n<p>This is a big, flat phone featuring a 120 Hz 6.7-inch OLED at 1440×3120. Like the S25 Ultra, it has a titanium frame with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The front has Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 for improved scratch protection. There's almost no bezel around the display—in fact, there's almost no phone around the display. The body is only 5.8 mm thick, a substantial reduction from the similarly sized S25+ at 7.3 mm. That's really this phone's claim to fame: It's really thin. Everything else (and we do mean everything) is secondary to that.</p>\n<p>Cramming premium camera modules into a smartphone is an engineering challenge even when you're not trying to make the phone as slim as possible. Similar to foldables, there just isn't enough space in the S25 Edge for a full suite of Samsung cameras. Therefore, this phone only has two rear camera modules: a 200 MP primary shooter that appears identical to the S25 Ultra's and a meager 12 MP ultrawide. There's a 12 MP selfie camera on the front as well. There is no telephoto lens at all, which you get even on the base model S25.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/form-over-function-samsung-unveils-the-super-slim-galaxy-s25-edge/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/form-over-function-samsung-unveils-the-super-slim-galaxy-s25-edge/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77b57c3f6777c7a42e13db20883da58304b81ec97c23ce4949db36037b899de5","category":"Tech"}
