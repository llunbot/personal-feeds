That’s especially true when you’re posted up at the trailhead on a hot day with the sun blazing overhead. If you happen to have driven to that spot, an awning for your roof rack can be an oasis from the heat – as long as it is quick to deploy and easy to stow. Something like the Yakima MajorShady 270. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve used the MajorShady at trailheads after a bike ride while chilling and having some lunch. I use it <em>a lot</em> for lunch stops while out Jeepin’ around the deserts and mountains on day trips. But, mostly I use this awning for shelter from the elements while on camping trips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s get the tech details and retail out of the way before I get into how it performed. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div><figcaption>Super quick deployment</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Yakima MajorShady 270</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-deployed-logo-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-deployed-logo-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Yakima MajorShady Awning review deployed logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-deployed-logo-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-deployed-logo-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-deployed-logo-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-deployed-logo-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-deployed-logo-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-deployed-logo-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The MajorShady 270 is a freestanding 270-degree, roof-mounted awning. And, as far as awnings go, this one is pretty pricey at a retail of $949. At the time of this writing, it looks to be on sale for <a href=\"https://yakima.com/products/majorshady-270\" target=\"_blank\">$759</a> on the Yakima site.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This awning comes in two flavors, left-hand swing and right-hand swing. Meaning, that you can have it open from the passenger side of your vehicle or the driver’s side. Because the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/yakima-skyrise-hd-medium-rooftop-tent-rtt-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Yakima tent</a> that I was reviewing at the time of mounting the awning, opened to the driver’s side, I opted for the awning to open on the passenger side. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-beefy-aluminum-framing-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-beefy-aluminum-framing-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Yakima MajorShady Awning review beefy aluminum framing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-beefy-aluminum-framing-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-beefy-aluminum-framing-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-beefy-aluminum-framing-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-beefy-aluminum-framing-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-beefy-aluminum-framing-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Heavy-duty aluminum frame and hinge</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It uses heavy-duty support arms, which aid in a super easy deployment. The awning material is made of 420D poly-cotton fabric with PU coating. This means it’s not only durable and waterproof but very light. the vinyl travel cover is not too tight and makes it easy to slip on and off, as well as zip it closed and open. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-lunch-San-Gabes-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-lunch-San-Gabes-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Yakima MajorShady Awning review lunch San Gabes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-lunch-San-Gabes-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-lunch-San-Gabes-297x224.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-lunch-San-Gabes-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-lunch-San-Gabes-768x578.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Campsite</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One added thing that I love about the awning’s appearance is the topo pattern that is on the top and bottom. The MajorShady 270 also has two support legs that clip up out of the way when not needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-big-bear-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-big-bear-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Yakima MajorShady Awning review big bear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-big-bear-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-big-bear-297x224.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-big-bear-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-big-bear-768x578.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Lunch on the trail, Big Bear</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yakima claims that it provides 80 square feet of sun and weather protection.

The Rib Cage reinforces the removable roof and allows for the load bars to be attached, which means I can use a rooftop tent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-L-brackets-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-L-brackets-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Yakima MajorShady Awning review L brackets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-L-brackets-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-L-brackets-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-L-brackets-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-L-brackets-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-L-brackets-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-L-brackets-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Beefy “L” brackets</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I used Yakima HD Load Bars to install the tent and awning. The awning came with “L” brackets which made it easy to install. The MajorShady 270 isn’t very heavy, but it is a little awkward to get into place. So, to make the installation easier, I used two people to slide it onto the top of the HD Load Bars. The install took about 15-20 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How it Performed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The MajorShady is so easy to deploy and break back down, which means that I use it more. Less than a minute to deploy, and a little over 2 minutes to close up. For me, the fact that it was so easy to deploy, made me want to deploy it all the time, which I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-pole-fastend-to-arm-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-pole-fastend-to-arm-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Yakima MajorShady Awning review pole fastend to arm\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-pole-fastend-to-arm-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-pole-fastend-to-arm-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-pole-fastend-to-arm-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-pole-fastend-to-arm-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-pole-fastend-to-arm-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-pole-fastend-to-arm-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Support pole in the storage position</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You would definitely need to use the two built-in support legs and guy lines when using the MajorShady in very windy conditions. I try to never camp in severe winds, so, I’ve never had to use the legs and line when using the awning.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-lunch-on-Devils-HWY-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-lunch-on-Devils-HWY-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Yakima MajorShady Awning review lunch on Devil's HWY\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-lunch-on-Devils-HWY-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-lunch-on-Devils-HWY-297x224.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-lunch-on-Devils-HWY-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-lunch-on-Devils-HWY-768x578.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Lunch break </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like most awnings that are attached to vehicles, using them is not always ideal. Sometimes the sun is in a spot that makes deploying traditional “straight” awnings a futile effort. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-campground-shade-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-campground-shade-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Yakima MajorShady Awning review campground shade\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-campground-shade-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-campground-shade-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-campground-shade-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-campground-shade-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Campground shade</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But, with the MajorShady and its 270 degrees of coverage, this happened hardly ever.

This lil’ bar can be left down when there is no rain or erected when there is rain. Deploying this lil’ pole helps the rain drain off the edge of the awning, preventing surprize puddles on the top of the awning.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-eastern-sierras-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-eastern-sierras-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Yakima MajorShady Awning review eastern sierras\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-eastern-sierras-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-eastern-sierras-297x224.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-eastern-sierras-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yakima-MajorShady-Awning-review-eastern-sierras-768x578.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>More lunch on the trail</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With it mounted to the roof, it didn’t add a lot of additional wind noise in the Jeep when at highway speeds.

Even if you would like some shade while you kick back and share food and drink with your riding buddies, I would seriously consider purchasing the Yakima MajorShady 270 Awning. It’s been a game-changer for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out some more details on the MajorShady, as well as all of the accessories and goodies Yakima has to offer by hitting the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://yakima.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Yakima.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/yakima-majorshady-270-awning-roof-rack/\">Yakima MajorShady 270 Awning Throws Shade Anywhere (In a Good Way)</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8280c67a47fe7941e8a95e11fbce3d5ec826a470de42859aa43134c638f190ad","category":"Cycling"}
