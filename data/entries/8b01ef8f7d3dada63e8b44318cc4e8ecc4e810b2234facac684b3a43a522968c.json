Google claims this one is fixing a high-profile <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/android-14s-ransomware-data-storage-bug-locks-out-users-remains-unfixed/\">Android 14 storage bug</a> that was locking some people out of their devices. The November Security Bulletin contains the <a href=\"https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-11-01\">usual pile</a> of security fixes, while consumer-oriented Pixel <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/242705137/google-pixel-update-november-2023\">patch notes</a> list a few user-facing changes. The important line is \"Fix for issue occasionally causing devices with multiple users enabled to show out of space or be in a reboot loop.\" A footnote points out that this is for the \"Pixel 6, Pixel 6a, 6 Pro, 7, 7 Pro, 7a, Tablet, Fold, Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro.\"</p>\n<p>We're on about day 33 of the Android 14 storage bug. For devices with multiple users set up, there is some kind of storage issue that is locking users out of their device. Some are completely unusable, with the phone bootlooping constantly and never reaching the home screen. Others are able to boot up the device but don't have access to lock storage, which causes a huge amount of issues. Some users likened the bug to \"ransomware,\" a type of malware that encrypts your local storage and then demands money for your data. One fix is to completely erase your device with a factory reset, but a lot of users don't want to do that.</p>\n<p>The earliest reports of this started just <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/173011j/android_14_upate_kills_pixel_6_pro_with_storage/\">days after</a> the October 4 launch date. Google usually rolls updates out slowly so it can pull them if issues like this pop up to minimize damage. That didn't happen here, though. Google failed to respond quickly to initial reports and just let the bug roll out to everyone. Some people even report being freshly hit with the bug just <a href=\"https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/305766503#comment319\"><em>four days ago</em></a> because Google 1) let the update roll out without stopping it and 2) can't patch its software quickly enough. The biggest <a href=\"https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/305766503?pli=1\">issue tracker</a> thread on this bug is up to 1,000-plus likes and 850 comments of people locked out of their devices, and it took two separate rounds of news coverage for Google to acknowledge the bug after <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/google-promises-a-rescue-patch-for-android-14s-ransomware-bug/\">about 20 days</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982019#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982019&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8b01ef8f7d3dada63e8b44318cc4e8ecc4e810b2234facac684b3a43a522968c","category":"Tech"}
