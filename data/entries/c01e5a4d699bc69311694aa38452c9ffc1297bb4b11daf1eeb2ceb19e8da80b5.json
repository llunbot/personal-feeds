The limited edition highlights three of the iconic BMX brand’s ‘most recognizable’ early offerings, now reissuing the FS1 &amp; Supergoose bikes, and Motomag III wheels in new retro colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, we are (<em>at least, I am</em>) getting old. But if cool versions of awesome old school bikes like these keep getting made, I’m kinda fine with the passage of time!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>50th-anniversary Mongoose Classics Collection of BMX Icons</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_old-school-cool-bikes-made-new-again-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_old-school-cool-bikes-made-new-again-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Mongoose Classics Collection 50th-anniversary BMX Icons, retro-style\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_old-school-cool-bikes-made-new-again-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_old-school-cool-bikes-made-new-again-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_old-school-cool-bikes-made-new-again-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_old-school-cool-bikes-made-new-again-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_old-school-cool-bikes-made-new-again-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_old-school-cool-bikes-made-new-again-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_old-school-cool-bikes-made-new-again-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Mongoose)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m just going to let Mongoose take over much of the story here, because the limited edition reissue of these three icons is more about nostalgia than my day-to-day deep dive into the latest &amp; greatest cycling tech. These are just great-looking bikes that pull at old BMXer heartstrings and hopefully can entice a new generation of 2-wheeled-addicts, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Few bikes have defined a generation of innovation and design the way Mongoose’s iconic designs of the 1970s and 1980s did for BMX</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Supergoose: An ’80s Icon</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Supergoose-bike-in-red-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Supergoose-bike-in-red-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Mongoose Classics Collection 50th-anniversary BMX Icons, Supergoose\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Supergoose-bike-in-red-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Supergoose-bike-in-red-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Supergoose-bike-in-red-1536x853.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Supergoose-bike-in-red-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Supergoose-bike-in-red-768x427.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>First launched in 1979, the Supergoose was one of the most recognizable bikes of the 1980s. The new replica Supergoose was designed around the popular 1984 “loop-tail” frame. Like the 1984 model, today’s Supergoose features 4130 chromoly tubing and alloy drilled Pro Class Rims, unique to Mongoose. It will match the spec of its predecessor with Dia-Compe brakes and levers, Pro Class handlebars, and colorways with pad sets inspired by the original models.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>FS-1: The Original Freestyler</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_FS1-bike-in-lavender-purple-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_FS1-bike-in-lavender-purple-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Mongoose Classics Collection 50th-anniversary BMX Icons, FS-1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_FS1-bike-in-lavender-purple-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_FS1-bike-in-lavender-purple-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_FS1-bike-in-lavender-purple-1536x853.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_FS1-bike-in-lavender-purple-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_FS1-bike-in-lavender-purple-768x427.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>The FS-1, first launched by Mongoose in 1985, was the brand’s intro into the growing BMX freestyle scene of the late ’80s. The newest addition to the Classics collection, the FS-1 is available in green or lavender and features a 4130 chromoly freestyle frame and chromoly fork with four period-correct peg bosses. The FS-1’s authentic Viscount Dominator saddle on a laid-back seat post, and five-spoke nylon mag wheels with white gumwall tires all honor the original release.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Motomag III: The BMX Pioneer</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Motomag-III-colors-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Motomag-III-colors-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Mongoose Classics Collection 50th-anniversary BMX Icons, Motomag III\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Motomag-III-colors-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Motomag-III-colors-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Motomag-III-colors-1536x853.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Motomag-III-colors-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Motomag-III-colors-768x427.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Motomag wheels were the innovation that brought Mongoose into being, and quickly went on to define the aesthetics of early BMX as standard race equipment in the mid ’70s. Although out of production for 40 years, the Motomag design is still recognized around the world to this day. The third generation Motomag III </em>[which <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mongoose-motomag-iii/\" target=\"_blank\">returned 2 years ago</a>]<em> mimics the original but incorporates modern touches, including sealed bearing hubs and freewheel compatibility for a more universal fit. The Motomag III will be available in three colorways—silver, yellow and red.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mongoose 50th Classics Collection – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Supergoose-in-blue-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Supergoose-in-blue-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Mongoose Classics Collection 50th-anniversary BMX Icons, Supergoose complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Supergoose-in-blue-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Supergoose-in-blue-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Supergoose-in-blue-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Supergoose-in-blue-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_Supergoose-in-blue-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in total fanboy and fangirl service, these 50th-anniversary Mongoose Classics Collection bikes and wheels will ship in retro packaging. That means “white litho-laminated” boxes for the bikes and “period-correct brown” wheel boxes, all decked out with classic ’80s style Mongoose artwork. Total collectibles vibes going on here. But the bikes are really meant to be ridden, and really are quite accessibly-priced vs. other new bikes or well-kept original bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mongoose Classics Supergoose and FS-1 complete retro BMX bikes both sell for $550. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_motomag-3-wheels-box-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_motomag-3-wheels-box-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Mongoose Classics Collection 50th-anniversary BMX Icons, Motomag 3 wheels packaging\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_motomag-3-wheels-box-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_motomag-3-wheels-box-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_motomag-3-wheels-box-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_motomag-3-wheels-box-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons_motomag-3-wheels-box-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, these special edition 20″ Motomag III wheels will set you back $300.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both complete bikes and the wheels separately, will be available starting in October, direct from Mongoose online. Or though, for buyers outside of the US, pick them up on <a href=\"https://www.albes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Albes.com</a> – “the world’s local BMX shop”. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Mongoose Classics Collection 50th-anniversary BMX Icons\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons-1536x853.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/50th-anniversary-Mongoose-Classics-Collection-of-BMX-Icons-768x427.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t worry, yet. Mongoose list the bikes online now as ‘Sold Out’. But actually they haven’t offered them up yet. You can check them out now.
