Knowing Covid is still running rampant all up and down the Rockies, I usually opt for a meet-up outdoors. Whether that means for a cup of coffee or a bike ride, I like catching up with people but want to err on the side of safety these days. Last March, our good friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gideontsang/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Gideon</a> came through town with his new-to-him Madrean 27.5 hardtail.

We’ve been doing this since 2007 on this website and it’s a labor of love. Hubert’s work is so unique and as you can see, it spans across all uses. I’ve even got some older photos of <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2014/02/beautiful-bicycle-cycles-dautremont-road/\" target=\"_blank\">his road bike</a> and <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2013/08/beautiful-bicycle-cycles-dautremont-porteur/\" target=\"_blank\">porteur bike</a> in our Archives if you really want to nerd out!</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/01/Madrean-32.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Madrean, and Hubert, are still to this day some of my favorite branches within the US framebuilding tree. Hubert learned his framebuilding skills from Drew at <a href=\"https://engincycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Engin Cycles</a> in PA and has spent a good amount of time tinkering in his new workshop on a variety of projects from the <em>high</em>-art <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2021/01/a-look-at-the-rangefinder-collaboration-between-adam-sklar-hubert-dautremont-and-jonathan-pucci/\" target=\"_blank\">Rangefinder project</a>, to <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2020/02/ronnie-romances-madrean-ultradynamico-country-fixed/\" target=\"_blank\">various tidbits for Ronnie Romance</a> and more. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Gideons-Madrean-Hardtail-31.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>When I emailed him about the bike that Gideon bought from him late in 2020, his reply was very succinct: </p>\n<blockquote><p>“Oh Dang so cool! That guy has style for days.<br />\nThat was one of the first bikes I built in my Tucson shop. I didn’t paint it ’til the beginning of last summer and then never even got to ride it before Gideon bought it! The color is from a ’77 Yamaha XT500 (Ginger Brown), same as what I’m rebuilding right now.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Gideons-Madrean-Hardtail-2a.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>There’s nothing ostentatious about this build. It’s a fillet brazed frame with <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2020/10/johns-retrofit-retrotec-27-5-hardtail-with-paragon-machine-works-rocker-dropouts/\" target=\"_blank\">Paragon rocker dropouts</a>, a beautiful 44mm headtube that houses the Madrean logo, and a custom <a href=\"https://www.roguepanda.com/shop/full-framebag/\" target=\"_blank\">Rogue Panda framebag</a>. The most important thing to remember is this steel bike has a long life ahead of it. </p>\n<p>Thanks for being so stylish, Gid! See ya soon my friend.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"e22641c7e5d0e516e34321537f20d5bad526c3cfced3ced385bc2cd89f0e9980","category":"Cycling"}
