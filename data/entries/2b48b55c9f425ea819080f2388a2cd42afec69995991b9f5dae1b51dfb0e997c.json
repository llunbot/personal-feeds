ASSOS has woven elements of its premium Equipe RS racing range into the new, lower-priced Equipe R S9 bib shorts.</p>\n<p>Priced at £155 / €180 / $210, the Equipe R S9 shorts now form the entry point to the brand’s range, offering WorldTour-proven tech in a simplified package for everyday riders.</p>\n<h2>What’s new with the ASSOS Equipe R S9 shorts?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The shorts use tech first seen on the brand’s top-end kit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>ASSOS</i></span></div>\n<p>Following positive feedback from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour teams</a> about the A-Lock bib strap used in the top-end ASSOS Equipe RS shorts, this crossed-bib construction has been adopted in the new bib shorts.</p>\n<p>The main panels are constructed using what ASSOS calls ‘Type.443’ material.</p>\n<p>This provides similar compression, breathability and abrasion resistance to higher-priced models, according to ASSOS.</p>\n<p>The material also offers UPF 50+ protection – an important feature for racing and riding in the hotter months.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The shorts have an aerodynamic cut.</span></figcaption><span> <i>ASSOS</i></span></div>\n<p>An aerodynamically optimised cut has been developed in tandem with WorldTour racers, giving a secure, close and compressive fit in a standard leg length.</p>\n<p>The make-up of the bib straps themselves has been improved too, with a change in the elastic element resulting in a faster drying time and reduced weight, ASSOS claims.</p>\n<h2>What makes the new ASSOS Equipe R S9 chamois special?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The shorts feature a three-layer chamois pad.</span></figcaption><span> <i>ASSOS</i></span></div>\n<p>ASSOS’ patented multi-layered chamois insert, which it calls ‘3D Waffle’, is constructed using no fewer than three layers of foam.</p>\n<p>The layers are perforated in order to aid breathability, while simultaneously reducing unnecessary weight.</p>\n<p>These three layers combine to create a 9mm-thick chamois, shaped using thermoforming to reduce any unwanted ridges or joins.</p>\n<p>The compressive foam used in the pad is designed to act as a shock dampener over rougher roads, enhancing comfort in the saddle.</p>\n<p>Lastly, ASSOS’ classic ‘goldenGate’ zig-zag stitching method means the chamois is attached to the main body of the shorts at the front and back, though not along the central edges.</p>\n<p>This enables the chamois to move across the middle, working with your body for optimal positioning to ensure greater comfort, ASSOS explains.</p>\n<h2>ASSOS Equipe R S9 bib shorts key details</h2>\n<h3>Zero-pressure waist</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The R9 bib shorts are designed to be lightly compressive and fit like a second skin.</span></figcaption><span> <i>ASSOS</i></span></div>\n<p>The waist area of the Equipe R S9 bib shorts has been designed to eliminate localised pressure points across the lower abdomen and groin, which can cause discomfort.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, the upper-shorts area is highly elasticated and cut carefully to fit like a ‘second skin’.</p>\n<h3>Ultralight leg grippers</h3>\n<p>To further enhance comfort, ASSOS has used its 6cm Ultralight leg grippers for the Equipe R S9 shorts. These are otherwise found only on the premium models in the racing-oriented Equipe range.</p>\n<p>This includes the Equipe RS S9 Targa, the choice of WorldTour racing teams.</p>\n<p>These leg bands offer light compression, backed by a layer of tiny silicone dots for additional grip to stop them from moving as you ride.</p>\n<h3>X-frame</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bib straps cross over at the rear, with the intention of improving comfort.</span></figcaption><span> <i>ASSOS</i></span></div>\n<p>Crossing over behind your back, the bib straps of the Equipe R S9 bib shorts are anchored into a more secure fit, ASSOS claims, ensuring the fit of the shorts panels and most importantly chamois stays in place.</p>\n<p>This is even more crucial when it comes to the higher-intensity efforts the bibs were designed for.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.assos.com/ch_en/equipe-r-bib-shorts-s9-11-10-255-18.html?utm_source=bikeradar&amp;utm_medium=advertorial+&amp;utm_campaign=EQUIPE+R\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Equipe R S9 bib shorts direct from ASSOS</a></li>\n</ul>","author":"Katherine Moore","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"2b48b55c9f425ea819080f2388a2cd42afec69995991b9f5dae1b51dfb0e997c","category":"Cycling"}
