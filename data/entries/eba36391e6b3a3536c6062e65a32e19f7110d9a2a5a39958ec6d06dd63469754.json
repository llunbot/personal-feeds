Draft forms of the agreement had included text that called upon the countries that are part of the Paris Agreement to work toward \"an orderly and just phase out of fossil fuels.\" Reports now indicate that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/11/climate/cop-28-draft-agreement-fossil-fuel-monday/index.html\">this text has gone missing</a> from the latest versions of the draft.</p>\n<p>The agreement is being negotiated at the United Nations' <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/cop28\">COP28 climate change conference</a>, taking place in the United Arab Emirates. The COP, or Conference of the Parties, meetings are annual events that attempt to bring together UN members to discuss ways to deal with climate change. They were central to the negotiations that brought about the Paris Agreement, which calls for participants to develop plans that should bring the world to net-zero emissions by the middle of the century.</p>\n<p>Initial plans submitted by countries would lower the world's greenhouse gas emissions, but not by nearly enough to reach net zero. However, the agreement included mechanisms by which countries would continue to evaluate their progress and submit more stringent goals. So, additional COP meetings have included what's termed a \"stocktake\" to evaluate where countries stand, and statements are issued to encourage and direct future actions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990060#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990060&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eba36391e6b3a3536c6062e65a32e19f7110d9a2a5a39958ec6d06dd63469754","category":"Tech"}
