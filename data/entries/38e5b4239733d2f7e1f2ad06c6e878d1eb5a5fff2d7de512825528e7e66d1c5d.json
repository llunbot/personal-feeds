Do we really need another <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/650b-vs-700c-for-gravel/\">gravel wheel size</a> standard?</p>\n<p>Well, probably not, and certainly not right now – but, let’s be clear, Moots and WTB are very much presenting this as a possible option for the future, rather than a bona fide product development with a production timeline.</p>\n<p>“For now, this bike is just a passion project,” a Moots representative told BikeRadar from the MADE handmade bicycle show.</p>\n<p>“Moots knew MADE was on the horizon, and WTB was developing a 750d wheel and tyre. When WTB asked if Moots was interested in designing a bike around this experimental wheel size, they jumped at the opportunity to collaborate.</p>\n<p>“Right now, it’s too early to tell if 750d will take off, but it was worth trying something new.”</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Moots Routt CRDD gravel bike with 750d wheels\" title=\"Moots Routt CRDD gravel bike with 750d wheels\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This one took us by surprise.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Deven McCoy</i></span></div>\n<p>Whether a one-off passion project or an early look at the future, the prospect of a larger-diameter wheel for gravel riding is food for thought for gravel tech experimentalists</p>\n<p>The claimed benefits? “Smoother rolling over rough terrain,” according to Moots. Larger wheels can also allow taller riders to achieve a more proportional geometry.</p>\n<p>Moots took the new Routt CRD gravel bike, launched in early August, and built a prototype frame, the CRDD, to accommodate the prototype WTB KOM Light i25 rims, in a 750d size, and accompanying 750 x 40mm WTB Nano Raptor tyres.</p>\n<p>A 750d rim has a larger diameter than a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/700c-wheels/\">700c wheel</a>, increasing the bead-to-bead diameter measurement from 622mm to 660mm.</p>\n<p>Wrap this in a typical gravel tyre and it’ll apparently give an overall diameter similar to a typical 29in/700c wheel with an appropriately-wide mountain bike tyre.</p>\n<p>The bike is on display this week in Portland, Oregon at the inaugural MADE show. Let’s take a closer look.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Moots Routt CRDD gravel bike with 750d wheels\" title=\"Moots Routt CRDD gravel bike with 750d wheels\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Moots launched the Routt CRD earlier in August as a race-focussed gravel bike with integrated cable routing and built from the brand’s RSL (Race Super Light) titanium tube set.
