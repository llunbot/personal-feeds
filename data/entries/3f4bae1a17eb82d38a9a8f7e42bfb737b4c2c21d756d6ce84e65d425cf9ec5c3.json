After proving that it made sense to use a few common architectures to design a varied range of vehicles across multiple different brands, it decided to apply that same approach to software. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/volkswagen-audi-porsche-vw-group-plans-one-os-to-rule-them-all/\">It set up a new division</a> and moved the entire VW Group's software development under that roof, with a mandate to create a new unified automotive operating system for future VW Group EVs.</p>\n<p>In fact, the division had to work on three different systems simultaneously. Called E<sup>3</sup> for end-to-end architecture, E<sup>3</sup> 1.1 would be the software to run on VW Group's MEB platform for mass-market EVs. Cars using this software are now on the road, including the VW ID.4, Audi Q4 e-tron, and of course, everyone's favorite, ID. Buzz. E<sup>3</sup> 1.2 is destined for more upmarket EVs from Audi and Porsche, using the upcoming PPE platform. And that unified OS, called E<sup>3</sup> 2.0, would show up mid-decade in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/vw-groups-10-year-plan-a-single-ev-platform-across-all-its-brands/\">a new, unified platform across the entire VW Group</a>.</p>\n<p>It hasn't exactly gone smoothly. In 2020 VW replaced Christian Senger as the head of the division—called Car.Software.Org, now called CARIAD—with Dirk Hilgenberg. By 2022, problems with CARIAD's development and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/volkswagen-is-recalling-the-my2021-id-4-for-a-battery-software-update/\">buggy software</a> for the launch of the ID.3 and ID.4 EVs saw <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/600575/volkswagen-group-fired-diess-because-software-unit-fiasco/\">VW Group fire its chairman</a>, Herbert Diess, along with multiple reports of <a href=\"https://www.electrive.com/2022/07/14/software-problems-at-cariad-delay-volkswagens-model-planning/\">delays to future group vehicles</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.carscoops.com/2022/10/vw-cariads-software-issues-trigger-delay-of-porsche-macan-ev/\">the electric Porsche Macan</a>.
