So many, in fact, that picking one can be quite a headache – so you need to have a clear idea of what you want.</p>\n<p>If you need some help with what to look for in a road bike, watch our video primer below.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n<p>The main thing to bear in mind is that while all the road bikes in this price bracket are suitable for any type of tarmac-related riding, they start to become more tailored to specific purposes – branching off down either the sportive/endurance or racing route.</p>\n<p>Race-oriented bikes will have a long and low riding position, stretching you out more to distribute your weight over the wheels for a more agile ride. In contrast, endurance bikes seat you in a more upright position, with a shorter reach from the saddle to the handlebars, which will be positioned higher. This can give you a more comfortable ride over long distances, but may reduce how sporty a bike feels.</p>\n<p>The effects are nuanced and there’s a spectrum of how close to one end of the scale or the other individual bikes are; take a look at our guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\">road bike geometry</a> for more detail.</p>\n<h3>Frame material</h3>\n<p>Carbon starts to appear, but aluminium frames are more typical in this price range. In fact, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aluminium-road-bikes/\">best aluminium road bike</a> frames are considerably better than some entry-level carbon options.</p>\n<p>You can also find steel frames, although many of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-steel-road-bikes/\">best steel road bikes</a> cost more than £2,000, while the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-titanium-road-bikes/\">best titanium bikes</a> almost all fall into a higher price category.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Allez Sprint Comp 2022\" title=\"Specialized Allez Sprint Comp 2022\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Superbikes were once aluminium, and some fairly affordable performance models still are.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Whatever you go for, it can be worth prioritising the frame over the components at this price. Doing so will give you a great platform that can be <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/top-5-road-bike-upgrades/\">upgraded</a> with better parts when the ones supplied wear out.</p>\n<p>Components such as a replacement <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">groupset</a> can be expensive, but upgrades to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">tyres</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-bike-handlebars-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-ones/\">handlebars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-saddles/\">saddle</a> are relatively inexpensive. Even replacing the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-handlebar-tape/\">handlebar tape</a> can improve comfort.</p>\n<p>An upgrade to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-wheels/\">best bike wheels</a> is pricier, but can really bring out the performance of a quality frame, as well as lowering rotating weight. Keep the wheels your bike came with as a second-best set for winter riding.</p>\n<h3>Aero features</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vitus ZX-1 Evo aero road bike\" title=\"Vitus ZX-1 Evo aero road bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Drag-reducing design now furnishes bikes around the £2,000 mark.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Aerodynamics have become a really important design feature, with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">best aero road bikes</a> majoring on wind-cheating elements such as aero tube profiles and handlebar shapes.</p>\n<p>Those features are trickling down to the best road bikes under £2,000 / $2,000 and you can expect to find them on many bikes at this price point. What you’re unlikely to have fitted to a bike when it arrives are deeper-section wheels, which feature strongly in our list of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-wheels/\">best road bike wheels</a>.</p>\n<p>They too will give you an aero benefit, but will usually be too expensive to come stock on a bike at this price, because they are usually made of carbon fibre.</p>\n<h3>Brakes</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">Disc brakes</a> have largely taken over from rim brakes on bikes at all prices. They can give greater stopping power and better modulation, but crucially they are affected less by weather conditions such as wet roads than rim brakes. They also avoid wear on your wheel rims.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Trek Madone SLR aero road bike SRAM Red eTap AXS disc brakes\" title=\"DSC00057\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Disc brakes have largely taken over from rim brakes, although there are exceptions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The best disc brakes are hydraulically operated and you’ll find bikes under £2,000/$2,000 that feature them. They’re more complex and expensive than cable-operated disc brakes though, so quite a few bikes in this price range have mechanical, cable-operated brakes.</p>\n<p>There are still quite a few bikes with rim brakes priced under £2,000/$2,000. Rim brakes are substantially cheaper than either of the disc brake alternatives and they weigh less too.</p>\n<p>Opting for a rim brake bike might be a canny move if you live somewhere dry or don’t intend to ride in the wet, because you’ll probably get a higher overall spec or better-quality frame.</p>\n<h3>Tyre width and pressure</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Continental Grand Prix 4 Season road bike tyre\" title=\"Continental Grand Prix 4 Season - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Broader is, generally speaking, better for road bike tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan​ / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Another trend, that’s aided by the switch to disc brakes, is to wider tyres on road bikes. Whereas 23mm tyres were the norm 10 years ago, 25mm is on the narrow side for the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">best road bike tyres</a>. Many of the best road bikes come with 28mm tyres and some with even wider rubber.</p>\n<p>Wider tyres can be run at lower <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/road-bike-tyre-pressure/\">tyre pressures</a>, which gives a more comfortable ride. They can be <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/are-wider-tyres-faster/\">faster</a> too because the tyre conforms to the road surface rather than bouncing you over it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">Tubeless tyres</a> enable you to run even lower pressures without so much risk of pinch flats, while the sealant inside helps protect you from smaller punctures. A tubeless tyre may roll faster than a tubed tyre too.</p>\n<p>You may not get a full tubeless setup at this price, but often the wheels and tyres are tubeless-ready so that you can <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-set-up-road-tubeless-tyres/\">convert to tubeless</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of the best road bikes under £2,000/$2,000 have clearance for 28mm tyres or more and there are often mounting points so that you can combine them with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguards</a> for all-weather riding.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"24614a0a6aaa12aecc043c81452a190b7e6af2ce6d732dd8e9ecf07c013ea844","category":"Cycling"}
