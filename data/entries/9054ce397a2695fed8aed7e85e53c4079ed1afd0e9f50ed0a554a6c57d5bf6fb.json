launched their mountain bike apparel line a few years back. Now in their second generation, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpatagonia-dirt-roamer-bike-short-mens\">Dirt Roamer shorts</a> have some notable changes compared to the original, including a slightly longer inseam, tougher material, revised waist adjustment system, and the addition of a second pocket. They are still super lightweight, highly breathable, and impressively comfortable, but now they have a more versatile fit and improved durability, making them one of the best shorts out there. </p><p></p><p>Like many Patagonia products, the Dirt Roamer shorts are made with recycled materials in a Fair Trade Certified factory. The 86% recycled polyester and 14% spandex blend is impressively light, breathable, adequately stretchy, and feels great against the skin. All the seams are welded, reducing bulk and eliminating stitching that could cause irritation or chafing while pedaling. The angled hem of the leg opening hangs lower in the front and plays well with low-profile knee pads while avoiding calf contact in the back for enhanced pedaling comfort. The moderate 12.5-inch inseam length hangs nicely around the knees and avoids being too short which was a complaint about the original version. </p><p></p><p>The Dirt Roamer shorts come in a whopping eleven sizes with even numerical waist sizes between 28 and 44 along with 31 and 33 inches, so you be sure to get a relatively precise fit. Our size 32 test pair fit true to size with little need to use the two low-profile waist adjusters positioned externally on either side of the waistband. Still, they are there if you need them and they make for quick, easy, and secure on-the-fly tension adjustments. The contoured waistband fits very comfortably above the hips and it features a secure dual snap closure atop a short zippered fly. These minimalist shorts feature two zippered top-loading pockets, one on each thigh, that provide ample carrying capacity and easily fit a modern smartphone. The Dirt Roamer shorts are designed to pair with Patagonia’s <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpatagonia-dirt-roamer-liner-bib-mens\">Dirt Roamer Liner Bibs</a> or <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpatagonia-dirt-roamer-liner-bib-mens-patza18\">Liner Shorts</a> (sold separately), and the pockets feature a unique internal pass-through flap to access the contents of the cargo pockets on the liners. </p><p></p><p>While it is super lightweight and breathable, the material used in the Dirt Roamer shorts feels fairly durable. They have stood up well to regular use, a couple of minor crashes, and frequent scrapes from trailside bushes and branches. That said, they are quite thin and they wouldn’t be our first choice for hard-hitting riding at the bike park or enduro-style riding. </p><p></p><p>Regardless, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpatagonia-dirt-roamer-bike-short-mens\">Patagonia Dirt Roamer shorts</a> truly shine out on the trail, essentially going unnoticed while riding.

Not only are they the most affordable model we tested, but they are also extremely versatile, making them a solid option for anyone seeking a pair of shorts that’s suitable for any type of riding you’re doing. Dakine bills them as “rugged bike shorts for all of your adventures”, and we won’t argue with that. </p><p></p><p>With a 14-inch inseam and relatively roomy legs, the Vectra work well with any style of knee pads, making them a solid option for warmer days at the bike park or aggressive trail riding. Made from a lightweight but sturdy feeling blend of 96% recycled polyester and 4% spandex, the Vectra shorts feel like they can take some serious abuse, yet the material isn’t overly heavy or bulky, and the laser-cut ventilation holes on the inner thighs allow for surprisingly good airflow. </p><p></p><p>Our size Medium test pair fits true to size on our 32-inch waist tester, with a wide waistband that is lined with a soft, comfortable wicking material that feels good against the skin. The Vectra has an offset ratcheting closure that is secure, easy to use, and allows for around 2 inches of waistband adjustment. The overall fit is somewhat slim through the hips/buttocks with roomier legs and leg openings. All of the internal seams are stitched flat and the pockets are welded, providing a comfortable, chafe-free pedaling experience. </p><p></p><p>The Vectra shorts have two top-loading zippered pockets, one on each thigh, that offer ample space for most rider’s needs. The pockets are large enough to accommodate a smartphone and aren’t too intrusive while riding. That said, given their position towards the front of the thigh, the contents are quite noticeable while pedaling compared to some other pocket designs. Our only other real gripe with the Vectra shorts is the lack of a zipper fly that makes trailside rest stops a little less convenient. </p><p></p><p>Despite those minor qualms, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fdakine-vectra-short-mens\">Dakine Vectra shorts</a> stand out for their impressive versatility and reasonable price. If you’re looking for one short to cover your needs from the bike park to pedal-heavy trail rides, we think the Vectra are worthy of consideration.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fdakine-vectra-short-mens\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TNWPZ8B/brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dakine-Vectra-action-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dakine-Vectra-action-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding in the Dakine Vectra mountain bike shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dakine-Vectra-action-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dakine-Vectra-action-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dakine-Vectra-action-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dakine-Vectra-action-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dakine-Vectra-action-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dakine-Vectra-action-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dakine-Vectra-action-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dakine-Vectra-action-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Dakine Vectra shorts are impressively versatile and reasonably priced.

They currently offer several jerseys, a lightweight trail jacket, riding pants, and two models of shorts including the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=17985&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvelocio.cc%2Fcollections%2Fmens-off-road-pants-shorts%2Fproducts%2Fmens-ultralight-trail-short\">Ultralight Trail Shorts</a> that we got our hands on for testing. It didn’t take long to realize that these are some of the highest quality shorts on the market. We had the chance to test our shorts with <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=17985&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvelocio.cc%2Fcollections%2Fmens-off-road-jerseys%2Fproducts%2Fmens-delta-trail-tee-1\">Velocio’s Delta Trail Jersey</a> ($79), which was equally impressive.</p><p></p><p>Velocio’s expertise in crafting quality road bike apparel is immediately evident in both the fit and finish of the Ultralight Trail Shorts. The paneling of the shorts, articulation, and form-fitting cut are absolutely perfect. They come in nine sizes from XXS to 4XL, covering waist sizes between 27.5 to 40 inches. Our size Medium test pair has a claimed 32-inch waist and it fits true to size. Should you need to add a little tension to the waist, the shorts come with a Velocio-branded stretch belt made in collaboration with Arcade belts (also <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=17985&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvelocio.cc%2Fcollections%2Fss23-off-road-equipment%2Fproducts%2Farcade-belt%3F_pos%3D11%26_fid%3D8bd38fe0f%26_ss%3Dc\">sold separately for $35</a>) that fits through the belt loops. The lack of built-in waist adjusters may put some people off, but it does reduce weight, bulk, and bunching at the waistline, and ours fit so well that we didn’t have to use the belt anyway. Silicone dots across the back of the waistband help keep them in place while riding and a locking snap at the top of the zipper fly ensures they won’t pop open unexpectedly. </p><p></p><p>Inseam length varies by size with the Medium we tested coming in at 13.5 inches. They hang right down around the middle of the kneecap while standing, rise slightly above the knee while pedaling, and there is adequate space in the leg opening to work well with low-profile knee pads. The hem at the knee is bonded and taped, and along with the streamlined fit and ample stretch in the material, makes them exceptionally pedal-friendly. The relatively minimal design features two zippered pockets, one on each thigh, that are back-loading and hold contents like a phone out of the way and with impressive stability. </p><p></p><p>While expensive, they are in line with other high-end mountain bike shorts, plus they include a $35 belt with the purchase. Certainly, some riders will scoff at the lack of waist adjustability, but we found it unnecessary and the belt has you covered should you need to snug them up. We did notice that the articulation in the waist could cause them to hang a little funny when off the bike, though it is one of the reasons they are so comfortable and high-performing while riding.</p><p></p><p>If lightweight, excellent fit, and quality construction are important to you, check out the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=17985&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvelocio.cc%2Fcollections%2Fmens-off-road-pants-shorts%2Fproducts%2Fmens-ultralight-trail-short\">Velocio Ultralight Trail Shorts</a>.

They make several models of mountain bike pants and shorts, including the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F7mesh-industries-slab-short-mens\">Slab Shorts</a> we tested. The Slab Shorts are a minimalist’s dream, a lightweight, streamlined, and beautifully crafted model that performs impressively well on the bike and looks great too.</p><p></p><p>The Slab shorts are very lightweight, weighing in at just 160 grams for the size Small. Despite their feather weight, the 85% nylon and 15% elastane material doesn’t feel too flimsy. It stands up well to encounters with trailside obstacles and the occasional slide across the dirt, and the DWR finish effectively repels moisture from puddle splashes and light rain showers. Along with the streamlined fit, the material also has just enough stretch to allow for impressive freedom of movement while pedaling and maneuvering the bike without excessive material flapping in the wind or snagging on the saddle. </p><p></p><p>Inseam lengths vary by size for a proportional fit, with our size small test pair measuring in at 14 inches. They provide good leg coverage and hang right down around the kneecap, and the leg opening is large enough to accommodate low-profile, pedal-friendly knee pads. Inside the shorts, all of the seams are welded and taped, making them super smooth and very pedal-friendly. While they are slightly baggy, the overall fit is relatively slim and form-fitting, although 7Mesh does a wonderful job of creating proportional fits across their size range. In fact, their sizing is a bit different than most other brands, relying on hip and thigh measurements, as well as pants/waist size, on their size chart. If you’re considering any 7Mesh shorts, we highly recommend referencing their size chart and taking those measurements to ensure you get the correct size. </p><p></p><p>The Slab shorts feature a zipper fly and a metal snap along with an integrated <em>Ultrasuede</em> belt with a metal slip-hook and webbing ladder to adjust the tension of the waistband if needed. This closure system works well and we never experienced any unwanted slipping or sagging of our shorts during testing, which was a common complaint about the previous version. A single back-loading zippered pocket on the upper right thigh easily fits a smartphone and holds its contents securely and out of the way while pedaling.</p><p></p><p>Along with making quality apparel, the folks at 7Mesh are doing their best to be an environmentally and socially responsible brand. The Slab Shorts are constructed from Bluesign-approved and Okeo-Tex-certified fabric that is PFC and PFAS-free, and they are very transparent about their other environmental, manufacturing, and social initiatives on their website.

Their mountain bike product line has been slowly growing, but the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Frapha-trail-short-mens%3Fskid%3DRFAD0AN-BLALIGGRE-L\">Trail Shorts</a> are one of the first models they introduced and is a staple in their lineup. While they are on the expensive side, they’ve got a great fit, quality construction, and features that most riders will appreciate. </p><p></p><p>Rapha now offers three models of mountain bike shorts with the Trail Shorts being the most rugged of the bunch. These aren’t downhill shorts, mind you, but the material is just a bit thicker and sturdier feeling than the lighter-weight models, and this is also apparent in the comparatively heavier 245-gram weight for our size Medium test pair. The mid-weight of these shorts also makes them a touch warmer overall, not excessively hot, but not the coolest or breeziest shorts on hot days either. Fortunately, Rapha also makes the Trail Lightweight and Trail Fast and Light shorts for those seeking something a bit lighter and airier. </p><p></p><p>Our size Medium test pair fit true to size on our 32-inch waist tester, and they have belt loops as well as dual external locking waist adjustment tabs to take up any slack evenly on both sides. The broad waistband secures above the zipper fly with a locking snap that won’t ever pop open but does take a little getting used to. The waist is nicely contoured and articulated for comfort in the seated pedaling position, and we found the fit through the hips and buttocks to be relatively slim but spot-on. The fit in the legs is a bit roomier, and the 13-inch inseam length falls right down to the knees where an angled hem keeps them from rubbing the calves when pedaling. The unique paneling of the Trail shorts helps to minimize seams for comfortable and irritation-free pedaling, while the size of the leg opening works great with light to mid-duty knee pads if you wear them. </p><p></p><p>The Trail shorts have four pockets and ample room to suit most people’s needs both on and off the bike. The two open, jeans-style pockets are most useful and convenient off the bike when you’re running post-ride errands or grabbing beverages with your riding buddies. The other two are well-designed zippered, back-loading thigh pockets that are vertically oriented and hold contents off to the side and out of the way of the pedal stroke. A nice feature of these pockets is a small internal sleeve for your phone that helps keep it from flopping around when pedaling or smashing down a rough descent.</p><p></p><p>The Trail shorts don’t come cheap, but Rapha has gone out of its way to ensure you get your money’s worth from the investment. They include a small repair kit with several color-matched iron-on patches to fix small holes and offer a free repair program where they will try to fix any damage you can’t fix on your own. So, you no longer have to be a roadie to wear Rapha, and if you can justify the expense, the mid-weight <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Frapha-trail-short-mens%3Fskid%3DRFAD0AN-BLALIGGRE-L\">Trail shorts</a> are made to have a long life and look good doing it.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Frapha-trail-short-mens%3Fskid%3DRFAD0AN-BLALIGGRE-L\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fmens-trail-shorts%2Fproduct%2FTOS01XXAMC&amp;platform=pl\">Check Price at Rapha</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rapha-Trail-Shorts-action-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rapha-Trail-Shorts-action-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Testing the Rapha Trail mountain bike shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rapha-Trail-Shorts-action-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rapha-Trail-Shorts-action-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rapha-Trail-Shorts-action-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rapha-Trail-Shorts-action-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rapha-Trail-Shorts-action-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rapha-Trail-Shorts-action-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rapha-Trail-Shorts-action-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rapha-Trail-Shorts-action-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Rapha’s Trail shorts are a well-made and super comfortable mid-weight option.

If you ride in wet or highly variable weather conditions regularly and don’t want to wear pants all the time, the 3-layer waterproof Bastion shorts are a compelling option to keep you dry without overheating. At $200, they certainly aren’t inexpensive, but they are similarly priced to other fully waterproof shorts on the market.</p><p></p><p>Of course, not everyone needs or wants waterproof shorts, but those who live in perpetually wet areas or are seeking a little extra wind and water protection for those shoulder season rides are the target market of the Bastion shorts. Constructed from a 3-layer waterproof fabric with fully taped seams, they protect from tire spray in the rear and rain and splashes in the front, keeping you dry if the weather goes south or you choose to go out and ride in the rain. While they aren’t quite as breathable as lightweight non-waterproof shorts, the fabric does allow heat and moisture to escape and air easily circulates up from the leg opening to keep you cool. </p><p></p><p>POC doesn’t specify an inseam length for the Bastion shorts, but we measured it at 15 inches on our size Medium test pair. With an angled hem, they actually feel a bit longer than that and they provide lots of leg coverage, hanging just below the kneecap while standing and barely rising above it while pedaling. The long cut, along with roomy legs and a fairly large leg opening, plays super well with any kind of knee pads. At the waist, a single metal snap secures a flap over the zipper fly and two large external velcro tabs provide a couple of inches of waistband adjustment. We found the broad waistband to be quite comfy, with minimal bunching from the adjusters even when snugged up to fit our 32-inch waisted tester.</p><p></p><p>There are a total of three pockets, two zippered hand pockets and one on the rear of the waistband. While we don’t love the positioning of the front pockets that hold their contents on the top of the thigh, they provide plenty of space and the mesh lining means they can be used for ventilation if they aren’t carrying anything. The small zippered pocket on the back is the perfect size to fit a card or other small, thin items. </p><p></p><p>While the Bastion shorts are certainly great for riding in wet and sloppy conditions, they aren’t exactly the shorts you want to be wearing when it’s dry or warm. The material is somewhat noisy when pedaling and they are simply overkill when taken out of their conditions niche. They are indeed a boutique product aimed squarely at specific riders and conditions, but if you’re looking for quality waterproof shorts, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpoc-bastion-short-mens\">POC Bastion</a> might be a perfect fit.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpoc-bastion-short-mens\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0921XB8Q4/brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-water-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-water-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"POC Bastion shorts beading water\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-water-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-water-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-water-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-water-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-water-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-water-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-water-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-water-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>POC’s waterproof Bastion shorts are great for riding in the rain or for days like this when the weather can’t quite make up its mind.

At first glance, one could easily mistake these shorts for just another pair of everyday shorts, but behind the casual appearance, these light, stretchy, and comfortable shorts perform well on the bike and are just as comfortable and “normal-looking” off the bike whether you’re going for a hike or wearing them around town. Few shorts we’ve used can transition as seamlessly between activities as the Giro Arc. </p><p></p><p>The Arc shorts are offered in two inseam lengths, the regular 13-inch and the 11-inch version we tested. Eleven inches is definitely on the shorter end of the spectrum these days, though it’s great for those who prefer a shorter inseam or don’t wear knee pads, and the longer option is available for those who like a little more leg coverage. Our 11-inch test shorts hang just above the knee when standing and rise up the thigh a few inches when pedaling, and are well suited to XC-style or even gravel riding. The ripstop polyester material is thin, lightweight, and stretchy, and pedaling in these shorts is smooth, comfortable, and virtually silent with a relaxed, but not overly baggy fit with little excess material to flap in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Giro opted for a simple approach to the waistband which is secured with a metal button at the top of the zipper fly. There are belt loops, but wearing a belt is generally unnecessary with two external velcro adjustment tabs that offer a couple of inches of tension adjustment. They come in even numerical waist sizes between 28 and 40 inches, and our size 32 test pair fit perfectly true to size. </p><p></p><p>The styling is super subtle and does anything but scream mountain bike shorts with 3 solid, earth-tone color options and a small Giro logo printed on the side of the right leg. There are a total of three pockets, two of which are open, jeans-style hand pockets that further reinforce their casual style and off-the-bike functionality. The third pocket is a semi-hidden zippered pocket on the right thigh that zips vertically and loads towards the front of the leg. This pocket is large enough for a smartphone, though its position makes the contents fairly noticeable when pedaling.</p><p></p><p>If you’re interested in some mountain bike shorts that look as good and perform as well off the bike as while you’re riding, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgiro-arc-mid-short-mens%3Fskid%3DGIRZ35R-PORGRE-S36\">Giro Arc shorts</a> are worth a look.

The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpearl-izumi-summit-shell-short-mens\">Summit Shell shorts</a> are a great example, a super light and airy model that essentially disappears while riding and stands out for their impressive ventilation. </p><p></p><p>Like other lightweight, minimal models, there isn’t a whole lot to the Summit Shell shorts, but that’s also the beauty of them. They are made from a relatively thin and breathable material that is a blend of 87% recycled polyester and 13% spandex, providing ample stretch and relatively good airflow on its own. When you take all of the small laser cut perforations on the inner thighs into account, the Summit shorts work very effectively to keep air moving and help keep you cool on those hot days or during strenuous efforts. The only drawback to such good ventilation is that they can feel a little too cool on chilly morning or evening rides if you aren’t producing much heat.</p><p></p><p>The Summit Shell shorts come in even waist sizes between 28 and 44 inches, and our size 32 test pair fit our 32-inch waisted tester well. The closure consists of a short zippered fly with a metal hook buckle that is attached to a webbing strap that’s used to adjust the tension of the waistband. The 12.5-inch inseam length is pretty spot on for such a light and pedal-friendly pair of shorts, and the leg opening is just large enough to accommodate lighter-duty knee pads. The major seams are stitched flat, the hem is welded, and the material is nice and soft, so you can pedal for hours without any irritation.  </p><p></p><p>Two zippered pockets on the outside of each thigh provide a good amount of carrying capacity. Both are back-loading and oriented vertically and can easily fit a smartphone, and they hold their contents securely and out of the way of your pedaling motion, though they can be a little tricky to unzip when seated on the bike. With two solid color options and a logo that’s so small it’s barely even visible, the Summit Shell shorts also have a subtle and timeless style that’s sure to age well.</p><p></p><p>If you ride in warm to hot conditions or simply need maximum ventilation on your rides, the lightweight and pedal-friendly <a

the USA, and even fewer that use US-made fabrics. Mission Workshop is one of the few, a brand committed to designing and producing top-quality technical apparel, bags, and accessories from the Mission district in San Francisco, CA. Making clothes this way doesn’t come cheap, however, but the quality materials, construction, and on-the-bike comfort and performance help justify the asking price of the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18561&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmissionworkshop.com%2Fcollections%2Fperformance-apparel%2Fproducts%2Ftraverse-xc-lightweight-bike-short%3Fvariant%3D33165411319917\">Traverse XC shorts</a>.</p><p></p><p>Mission Workshop makes two models of baggy mountain bike shorts with the Traverse being a bit longer and beefier than the lighter-weight Traverse XC we tested. The Traverse XC has a more tailored cut that makes them a bit slimmer fitting and streamlined, as well as a shorter, 12-inch inseam that sits just above the knee and is well-suited to XC-style and gravel riding alike. The waistband is nicely contoured with a dual snap closure above the zipper fly and a unique integrated belt that works as the waist adjustment system. This thin but broad belt wraps around the majority of the waistband with a small metal buckle on the right side that allows you to add or remove tension on the fly. They also come in odd and even numerical waist sizes between 28 and 38, and although Mission Workshop says they run a little small, we found the size 32 to fit perfectly.</p><p></p><p>The Traverse XC shorts are constructed from a US-made Mil-spec stretch fabric that offers a good amount of stretch and has a surprisingly tough and durable feel. Still, it feels good against the skin, and pedaling in these shorts is comfortable and unrestrictive. The hem lays nice and flat, and the seams along the crotch gusset have been taped to prevent any chafing or irritation during the pedal stroke. Two top-loading zippered cargo pockets, one on each thigh, offer ample room to carry things on your rides, and their placement on the outside of the leg holds items nicely without conflicting with the pedal stroke. The small flap of fabric that covers the zippers gives the shorts a very clean aesthetic, though we found they made the zipper pulls a little harder to access at times. </p><p></p><p>One thing that stands out about the Traverse XC shorts is their super clean, minimalist styling. They come in 4 solid colorways, charcoal, black, navy, and olive, and they have essentially zero branding except for a super tiny Mission Workshop logo on the waistbelt buckle. These shorts look great whether you’re pounding out some miles or grabbing a bite or drinks with friends after a ride.

They’ve been producing mountain bike apparel for many years, and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-trail-air-shorts-mens\">Trail Air short</a> is one of their latest models intended to be a lightweight and well-ventilated short for pedal-heavy trail riding. These shorts deliver a high level of comfort, breathability, and mobility, and are a great option for anyone seeking a minimalist short for riding in warm to hot conditions.</p><p></p><p>The Trail Air shorts have a relatively slim fit through the hips and loose but not excessively baggy legs that caters well to their trail riding intentions. The 13.5-inch inseam hangs down around mid-knee and plays well with light to mid-duty knee pads. The angled hem is shorter in the back to prevent unwanted calf contact, and the welded hem and taped seams ensure an irritation-free pedaling experience. Specialized’s <em>Vaporize</em> woven fabric is a blend of 86% polyester and 14% spandex, and it is lightweight, adequately stretchy, highly breathable, and feels great against the skin. Some perforations on the inner thighs and on the back of the waistband aim to add a little more airflow, and these shorts live up to their airy promises.</p><p></p><p>The Trail Air shorts come in even waist sizes between 28 and 44, so most people will be able to find a relatively precise fit. A simple ladder strap buckle at the waist is used as both the closure system and the waist adjustment, offering about 2 inches of adjustability. We did find, however, that our size 32 test pair ran a little big, and we had the ladder strap maxed out and wouldn’t have minded being able to get them a little tighter. There is a bit of stretch in the waistband itself, which is the primary culprit, and we think it might be a good idea to size down if buying these shorts. A single zippered pocket on the left thigh makes up the storage capabilities. This backloading, pocket fits a phone perfectly and holds its contents securely and out of the way of the pedal stroke.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-trail-air-shorts-mens\">Specialized Trail Air shorts</a> are a well-designed and constructed pair of lightweight, breathable, and pedal-friendly trail riding shorts that are a great option for riding in the heat of summer.

Endura bills these shorts as a “lightweight and breathable trail short in a full stretch fabric providing a “barely there” feeling without compromising durability.” While they may be the lightest shorts in Endura’s range of baggy shorts, they strike us as more of a mid-weight, but well-ventilated option. </p><p></p><p>The Singletrack Lite shorts are made from a fabric that is a blend of 85% nylon and 15% elastane with a 4-way stretch. This material is nice and forgiving, providing excellent mobility and a high level of pedal-friendliness while still feeling surprisingly tough and durable. The 13-inch inseam hangs right down around mid-knee with leg openings that play nice with most styles of knee pads. The welded hem is also nice and smooth and glides over the top of the knee easily while pedaling. In addition to the “regular” inseam length we tested, Endura makes a “short fit” version of the Singletrack Lite that has a slightly shorter length. </p><p></p><p>We tested the size Medium with a claimed waist size of 33 – 35 inches, and they fit our 32-inch waisted tester quite well. This gives us the impression that they run on the small side, as we doubt someone with a 35-inch waist would fit into the Medium shorts. A dual snap closure secures the shorts at the top of the zippered fly and the broad waistband is lined with wicking material with silicone grippers added at the back to help keep them in place. Two external velcro tabs offer a couple of inches of tension adjustment and are quick and easy to use. Endura also added their <em>Clickfast poppers</em> on the inner waistband that allow you to snap them together with Endura Singletrack Bib Liner. While this system is unique, we found the snaps popped open quite easily in practice and weren’t as effective as we’d hoped.</p><p></p><p>Ventilation was clearly high on the priority list when designing the Singletrack Lite shorts, and they feature lots of laser-cut perforations on both the inner and outer thighs that allow for a significant amount of airflow. Three zippered pockets, 2 hand pockets, and one rear pocket offer lots of storage. We found all three pockets, but especially the hand pockets, to be more useful off the bike, however, as their placement holds items awkwardly and in conflict with the pedal stroke. </p><p></p><p>Endura has a long history of making quality mountain bike apparel, and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-singletrack-lite-short-mens\">Singletrack Lite</a> shorts are a compelling new option for anyone seeking a relatively light, well-ventilated, and durable pair of shorts. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-singletrack-lite-short-mens\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085CNX5G7/brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F100-airmatic-short-without-liner-mens\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t100% Airmatic Shorts\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$99</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>96% polyester/4% elastane</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Inseam Length</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>14 inches</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Pockets</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>2 zippered hand pockets, 1 zipper left thigh pocket</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>251 grams (size 32)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Even waist sizes 28 – 38</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F100-airmatic-short-without-liner-mens\">\n\n<img width=\"1133\" height=\"765\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Airmatic-Shorts.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Shorts of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Airmatic-Shorts.jpeg 1133w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Airmatic-Shorts-297x201.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Airmatic-Shorts-800x540.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Airmatic-Shorts-120x81.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-Airmatic-Shorts-768x519.jpeg 768w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Soft, stretchy material is comfortable on the skin</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Pair well with knee pads</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Thicker material good for park riding or cooler weather</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Heavier weight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not particularly well-ventilated</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Louder branding</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>100% has been in business since 1982 with deep roots in the sport of motocross. While they still make a range of products for the moto market, they have expanded their reach into other sports like road and mountain biking. 100% has been making mountain bike apparel for some time, and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F100-airmatic-short-without-liner-mens\">Airmatic shorts</a> are one of their more popular models of baggy shorts. While they are a bit more subtle than 100%’s DH-focused shorts, the Airmatic still has styling that speaks the brand’s motocross roots. </p><p></p><p>The Airmatic shorts have a relatively slim fit through the hips and buttocks that manages to be very comfortable thanks to great paneling and a bit of articulation. Likewise, the broad waistband is nicely contoured, and our size 32 test pair was spot on in terms of sizing. A metal slip-hook buckle and webbing ladder secure a flap over the top of the zipper fly and allow for 1.5 inches of waist tension adjustment. Inside the back half of the waistband, lots of silicone grippers help to further ensure these shorts stay in place while riding. The legs are loose-fitting but not super baggy, with a 14-inch inseam that hangs down right about mid-knee. The leg openings are well-sized, and they work great with light to mid-duty knee protection. </p><p></p><p>The material used in the Airmatic shorts is a blend of 96% polyester and 4% elastane, and while it has a tiny bit of stretch, it is a bit more restrictive than stretchier fabrics. That said, it doesn’t seem to restrict the pedal stroke in any way, though it is a bit less forgiving in terms of fit. It is incredibly soft, however, with a brushed backing that feels great against the skin and seams that lay nice and flat. It is a mid-weight fabric, and as such we found it to be a bit on the warmer side, and relatively limited in terms of ventilation and breathability. </p><p></p><p>Three zippered pockets comprise the storage capabilities of the Airmatic shorts. Two of these are zippered hand pockets that hold their contents on the front, top of the thighs. They are fairly deep, so the contents aren’t too in the way while pedaling, though they don’t exactly go unnoticed. A zippered pocket on the left thigh is great for use while riding, easily fitting a phone and holding it off to the side comfortably.

While the brand has a significantly larger presence in road cycling, they produce a number of garments aimed at the off-road market, including the <a href=\"https://www.sportful.com/US/en/Men/Cycling/Bibshort-%26-Overshorts/SKY-RIDER-GIARA-OVERSHORT/p/1123035_002\">Sky Rider Giara Overshort </a>we tested. Though these shorts are not without their quirks, they are impressively comfortable and made from one of the stretchiest fabrics we’ve ever seen.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Rider Giara shorts are made from a fabric that is a blend of 59% polyamide and 41% elastane. Compared to the fabrics used in most mountain bike shorts, which typically have around 10-14% spandex/elastane, this fabric is wildly stretchy. It is very comfortable against the skin, and it certainly doesn’t inhibit movement in virtually any way while pedaling or moving around the bike. One quirk about these shorts, however, is that the waistband is also incredibly stretchy, and given the lack of internal grippers or a waist adjustment system, we found a belt to be necessary to keep them in place while riding. </p><p></p><p>The fit of the Sky Rider Giara shorts is otherwise great. The size Medium fit our 32-inch waist tester quite well with a fairly tailored shape through the hips and buttocks. Despite the tailoring, they are quite forgiving to body size/shape given all the stretch in the material. We measured a 13-inch inseam, and they hang right down around the top of the kneecap with a leg opening that is large enough to work well with pedal-friendly knee pads. Two jeans-style pockets are great for your hands or items when you’re off the bike, while a zippered pocket on the left thigh provides a more secure location for use while riding. This top-loading pocket has ample room for a phone or similar-sized items, but the stretch in the material results in less stability, and you can feel things flopping around a little while you pedal. </p><p></p><p>Regardless of their quirks, the <a href=\"https://www.sportful.com/US/en/Men/Cycling/Bibshort-%26-Overshorts/SKY-RIDER-GIARA-OVERSHORT/p/1123035_002\">Sky Rider Giara Overshorts</a> are impressively comfortable thanks to the extremely high level of stretch in the fabric. They have a notably flowy and airy feel to them, and they allow for completely unrestricted freedom of movement on the bike. Our biggest gripe is that you’ll probably need to wear a belt with them, but if you can see past that, these are an extra stretchy and super comfortable option.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.sportful.com/US/en/Men/Cycling/Bibshort-%26-Overshorts/SKY-RIDER-GIARA-OVERSHORT/p/1123035_002\">Check Price

cycling-related news, technology, and products for well over a decade. In addition to writing about all things bike-related, cycling is a passion that all of our staff share. Every single member of the Bikerumor team is an avid rider, and it’s a dream come true to be able to test and review products and share our knowledge, experience, and love of riding bikes with our audience. We feel very fortunate to be in a position that allows us to spend time on the bike while analyzing products and providing insight that may help people make more informed purchase decisions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our mountain bike shorts review author, Jeremy Benson, has been professionally testing and reviewing mountain bikes, accessories, and apparel for over seven years. In that time, he has tested more than 30 different pairs of mountain bike shorts, including the 13 models in this review. Benson is an avid mountain bike rider and racer who started riding as a youth in the early 90s. He’s spent the past 22 years living in the Sierra Nevada mountains in and around Lake Tahoe, CA, obsessively riding the many hundreds of miles of nearby world-class singletrack, much of which is accessible from right out the door. Benson enjoys all styles of riding, from lung-busting XC and gravel races to massive backcountry epics, shuttle runs, steep skidders, and long hike-a-bikes, you name it. The amount of time he spends in the saddle makes him particularly tough on and critical of the gear he uses, and he’s always searching for the best products to enhance his experience and improve his performance out on the trails. Years spent testing all kinds of gear has helped him develop a keen ability to analyze and scrutinize products and convey his findings in reviews. Benson has also contributed to several other buyer’s guides including <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-helmet/\">mountain bike helmets</a> and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/\">best mountain bike shoes</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-sunglasses/\">cycling sunglasses</a> and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-hitch-bike-racks/\">hitch bike racks for transporting your rides</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this buyer’s guide, we rounded up 13 pairs of the best mountain bike shorts on the market to test and compare side by side. We spent months riding in these shorts in every weather condition and temperature you can imagine on rides ranging from casual trail rides with friends, all-day suffer fests, big shuttles, and even a few races and gravel grinds. While testing, we focused on important performance characteristics like fit, pedal-friendliness, ventilation/breathability, and pocket design. Each model was worn with and without knee pads to test compatibility, and friends were asked to comment on the style. After hundreds of hours and thousands of miles in the saddle, we honed in on our favorites and those that excel in specific areas compared to the rest. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shorts-testing-shot-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shorts-testing-shot-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Author Jeremy Benson testing mountain bike shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shorts-testing-shot-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shorts-testing-shot-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shorts-testing-shot-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shorts-testing-shot-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shorts-testing-shot-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shorts-testing-shot-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shorts-testing-shot-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shorts-testing-shot-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>All of the shorts in this review were tested over the course of several months.

There are a number of factors to consider when choosing your next pair of shorts, and we’ll break down some of the most important elements of mountain bike shorts below. Getting the right fit is the most important, but you’ll also want to get shorts that suit your riding style, personal style, weather conditions, and budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Type of Riding Do You Do?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As there are many different styles of mountain biking, there are just as many different mountain bike shorts to suit the needs of different riders. It stands to reason that a person who rides cross-country has different needs and wants from their shorts than someone who rides chairlifts at the bike park all day. As such, manufacturers design shorts for the various sub-genres of mountain biking using different materials, inseam lengths, and designs. If you participate in several different styles of riding, it may make sense to have several pairs of shorts that you can switch between. Likewise, different seasons have different demands, and having shorts of different weights or weather resistance may be helpful when the temperature or weather changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many cross-country riders and especially racers may prefer to wear lycra for performance reasons, there are baggy shorts that are well suited to high-efficiency, high-output XC riding. Generally speaking, cross-country riders typically opt for shorts that are lightweight, breathable, slim-fitting, and super pedal-friendly, which often feel like you aren’t wearing baggy shorts at all. For trail riding, most riders still prioritize pedal-friendliness and may gravitate towards lightweight shorts, though many prefer a slightly longer inseam to work with light-duty knee pads and slightly more robust fabrics for increased durability. Gravity-oriented riders who spend time riding DH at the bike park or smashing enduro laps generally prioritize heavy-duty fabrics for added protection and durability, as well as longer inseams and looser fits that play well with knee pads and/or protective undershorts. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-fit-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-fit-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Velocio Ultralight Trail shorts and proper fit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-fit-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-fit-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-fit-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-fit-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-fit-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-fit-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-fit-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-fit-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Getting shorts that fit properly is critical. The Velocio Ultralight Trail shorts are some of the best-fitting shorts that we’ve tested.

The better your shorts fit, the more comfortable they will be, and the less they will distract you from the important task of riding your bike. Shorts that fit well typically fade into the background and go virtually unnoticed while riding. Too tight and they put pressure on your abdomen or restrict your movement, too loose and they can slip down and require frequent adjustment while riding. If you wear padded liner shorts, or a chamois, it is also important to consider them as the shorts will need to fit over those as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waist size is the primary factor in the fit equation, and most shorts come in a range of sizes to fit the most typical waist sizes. It varies by brand, but many offer their shorts in numerical waist sizes that typically make it easy to find the size that’s closest to your waist measurement in inches. Other brands offer their shorts in what is known as categorical sizes – Small, Medium, Large, etc., with each size intended to fit a small range of waist sizes. With categorical sizing, always be sure to check a brand’s size chart to find where you fall in their size range. Additionally, many shorts feature waist adjustments that allow you to add or remove tension from the waistband to achieve the desired fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to waist size, how shorts fit through the hips, buttocks, and thighs is another factor to consider, particularly for those with more muscular legs or larger body structures. Ideally, you want the shorts to be loose enough that they aren’t squeezing any part of your body and allow for unrestricted freedom of movement without being excessively baggy. Some brands provide hip and thigh measurements for their shorts so you can get a good idea of how they will fit in those areas. 7Mesh even sizes their shorts based on hip and thigh circumference measurements to find the best fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Waist-adjustments-comparison-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Waist-adjustments-comparison-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Waist adjustment systems comparison shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Waist-adjustments-comparison-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Waist-adjustments-comparison-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Waist-adjustments-comparison-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Waist-adjustments-comparison-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Waist-adjustments-comparison-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Waist-adjustments-comparison-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Waist-adjustments-comparison-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Waist-adjustments-comparison-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Different brands use different methods of adjusting the tension of the waistband on mountain bike shorts. While different, they all work to achieve the same goal. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Waist Adjustments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many mountain bike shorts have built-in waist adjustment systems that allow you to add or remove tension from the waistband to dial in the fit. This is particularly important for shorts that are designed to fit a small range of waist sizes, and they typically offer around 1-2 inches of adjustability. There are a number of different systems that brands use to make those adjustments including external or internal velcro straps, ratcheting ladder straps, locking webbing straps, integrated belt systems, and more. The best systems are low profile, easy to access and use, secure, and pull tension evenly with minimal bunching of fabric. In addition to or sometimes in place of these systems, some brands include belt loops on their shorts so they can be worn with a belt as an alternative method of adding tension to the waistband. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inseam-length-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inseam-length-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing mountain bike shorts with knee pads\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inseam-length-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inseam-length-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inseam-length-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inseam-length-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inseam-length-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inseam-length-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inseam-length-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inseam-length-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The inseam length of mountain bike shorts varies. The POC Bastion shorts are the longest we tested at 15 inches, virtually eliminating the chances of pad gap when worn with knee pads. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Inseam Length</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, most baggy mountain bike shorts have inseams that range anywhere from around 11 inches to 15 inches. Shorts that hang down around the knee when standing and rise slightly above the knee when pedaling are the norm for most riders. What length works best for you will depend on your riding style, personal style, height, and whether or not you wear knee pads. Shorts designed with pedal friendliness as the priority often have somewhat shorter inseams that are less restrictive of the pedal stroke, while those designed with gravity riding in mind typically have longer inseams for more leg coverage and better compatibility with knee pads. In terms of knee pad compatibility, longer inseams tend to play nicest as they cover the top of the pad and help to avoid “pad gap” which can be considered a fashion faux-pas in certain circles. Of course, a rider’s height is also a consideration as a 15-inch inseam may fit a taller rider perfectly and look like a pair of capris on a shorter person. Fortunately, some brands vary their inseam lengths by size for a more proportional fit across their size range.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Laser-cut-ventilation-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Laser-cut-ventilation-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Laser cut ventilation holes on the Pearl Izumi Summit Shell shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Laser-cut-ventilation-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Laser-cut-ventilation-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Laser-cut-ventilation-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Laser-cut-ventilation-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Laser-cut-ventilation-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Laser-cut-ventilation-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Laser-cut-ventilation-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Laser-cut-ventilation-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Laser-cut ventilation holes, like those on the Pearl Izumi Summit Shell shorts, allow for excellent airflow on these lightweight and breezy shorts. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ventilation and Breathability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the weather and temperatures you ride in most frequently or even seasonally, how much you perspire, or the level of effort you put in while riding, the ventilation and breathability of your mountain bike shorts may or may not be an important factor to consider. People who live in warmer climates or ride in the heat of the day will generally be more inclined to wear lightweight or well-ventilated shorts than those who live and ride in more temperate regions. If you live in an area where the seasons bring massive temperature swings, it will often be best to have multiple pairs of shorts for different conditions or find the goldilocks shorts that work well enough across a wide temperature range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ventilation is approached in various ways by different brands and for different styles of shorts. Most mountain bike shorts are made from technical fabrics that allow for some breathability and dry quickly when wet. Some shorts are made of fabrics that are so light and airy that they barely even feel like they are there, allow air to pass through easily, and dry incredibly quickly. Other shorts combine light or mid-weight fabrics with ventilating features, most commonly in the form of laser cut perforations on the inner thighs to allow additional airflow. Zippered vents are becoming less common, though some brands still use them, and they work well and allow the rider to regulate the ventilation as needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-Construction-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-Construction-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Materials and taped seams of the POC Bastion waterproof mountain bike shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-Construction-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-Construction-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-Construction-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-Construction-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-Construction-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-Construction-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-Construction-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/POC-Bastion-Construction-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>POC’s Bastion waterproof mountain bike shorts use technical waterproof fabric, taped seams, and waterproof zippers to keep you dry on the trail. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Weather Resistance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that shorts only cover about half your leg and have large openings at the hem by the knee, they are inherently not the most weather-resistant garment. Some brands and models of shorts do have weather-resistant materials or features in their designs, however, which may be of interest to those who ride in wet or variable conditions. While the majority of mountain bike shorts use light to mid-weight fabrics that are intended primarily for use in dry and warm conditions, many of them have a Durable Water-Repellant (DWR) finish applied that works to repel occasional splashes from puddles or very light rain showers and drizzle. When combined with the quick drying properties of the materials, these shorts are appropriate for most people most of the time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many people who ride in wet conditions frequently will often wear mountain bike pants or trousers for added coverage and weather protection, there are times when some weather-resistant shorts may be a better option. For those times, there are a number of shorts on the market that are either completely waterproof or have strategic waterproof panels to combat tire spray and/or rain. Waterproof shorts are certainly more of a niche product, but we have tested the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpoc-bastion-short-mens\">POC Bastion</a> shorts which are constructed completely from waterproof fabric and have fully taped seams to combat water from all angles. Endura is another brand that makes several models of waterproof and weather-resistant mountain bike shorts. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-shorts-pockets-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-shorts-pockets-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Pockets on the Velocio Ultralight Trail shorts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-shorts-pockets-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-shorts-pockets-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-shorts-pockets-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-shorts-pockets-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-shorts-pockets-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-shorts-pockets-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-shorts-pockets-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Velocio-Ultralight-Trail-shorts-pockets-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Well-designed pockets, like those on the Velocio Ultralight Trail shorts, allow for easy access and hold their contents securely and out of the way. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pockets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The number, placement, and design of pockets on mountain bike shorts vary pretty dramatically depending on the brand, style, and intended use. The importance of pockets also varies pretty dramatically between riders and largely depends on how you carry essentials while you ride (fanny pack, backpack, on the bike, in your pockets) and how much you intend to carry in your pockets while riding. Zippers are a common feature on most pockets so you can close them and keep the contents secure when you’re rattling down the trail. While many mountain bike shorts used to have lots of pockets, there has been a general trend towards more streamlined and minimal designs that have fewer well-designed pockets. All of the shorts we tested have at least one pocket with most having 2-3 and one model sporting a whopping 4 places to hold your stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, consider what you really need to carry in your pockets on a ride. This varies, of course, but space for at least a phone seems like the bare minimum. Some riders also like to stash a multi-tool, snack, keys, chapstick, and more. If you intend to carry more than a phone in your pockets, then shorts with just one pocket like the 7Mesh Slab or Specialized Trail Air may not have adequate storage for you. One thing that’s great about modern mountain bike shorts is that many brands have been designing really great pockets that are easy to access and hold their contents securely and out of the way. Often these are zippered, back-loading pockets on the thighs or hips, and they can typically fit a modern smartphone with good stability so it doesn’t flop around while pedaling or descending. Not all pocket designs are great, however, and some are not as well executed, easy to use, or pedal-friendly as others. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you look good, you feel good, and when you feel good, you can ride better. Right? Well, maybe it isn’t that simple, but all things being equal, we think that most people can agree that style matters a little bit. And, if you’re paying top dollar for some fancy mountain bike shorts, they might as well look good and line up with your personal aesthetic. Not too long ago, the mountain bike shorts market was flooded with models that looked like they were better suited to a motocross race than pedaling a bike through the woods. Thankfully, those days are mostly behind us, and while you can definitely still find shorts that have a moto-influenced style, mostly on the DH side, there are now plenty of options that come in more subdued colors and have minimal branding that appeals to a broader range of tastes. Looking at the shorts we tested, it is clear that solid colors and small logos are currently trending. Style is subjective of course, but there’s thankfully lots of variety when it comes to colors and designs that most people should be able to find something they want to wear. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Liner-short-detail-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Liner-short-detail-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"detail shot of a padded liner short or chamois turned inside out\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Liner-short-detail-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Liner-short-detail-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Liner-short-detail-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Liner-short-detail-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Liner-short-detail-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Liner-short-detail-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Liner-short-detail-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Liner-short-detail-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Padded liner shorts, or chamois, like the Patagonia Dirt Roamer Bib Liner (turned inside out to show detail of the pad) have a compressive fit and a cushioned pad that may enhance your comfort on the bike.

While not everyone rides with a padded liner, lots of folks appreciate the added comfort for seated pedaling provided by the pad, or chamois, in the liner. None of the shorts we tested came with a liner short, although several of the models can be purchased with a liner short included for a slight increase in price, or they can be purchased separately. While an included liner short does add value, these are typically not the highest quality. We recommend finding some good padded liner shorts or bibs that fit well and buying a few pairs to keep in rotation. There are lots of excellent options on the market these days that have higher quality chamois pads and/or special features like bib straps and integrated pockets for storage. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The models we tested range in retail price from $85 up to $185, with most models falling roughly in the middle of that range. Materials, designs, construction methods, brands, and marketing budgets all play a role in the final price of a pair of mountain bike shorts. Often, you get what you pay for, and if you’re willing and able to spend a bit more you get a higher-quality product. Such is the case with some of the more expensive models we tested like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=17985&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvelocio.cc%2Fcollections%2Fmens-off-road-pants-shorts%2Fproducts%2Fmens-ultralight-trail-short\">Velocio Ultralight Trail Shorts</a> which are super lightweight, fit amazingly, and have a great design and quality construction. Other models, like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpoc-bastion-short-mens\">POC Bastion</a>, command a high price due to their completely waterproof construction. At the same time, a more affordable pair of shorts like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikeshorts&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fdakine-vectra-short-mens\">Dakine Vectra</a> costs roughly half the price and will cover the needs of most riders and styles of riding while saving you a bunch of cash for more bike parts.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Mountain Bike Shorts</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why should I buy mountain bike shorts? Can’t I just ride in any shorts?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>You can mountain bike in any old pair of shorts you choose, and many people do. There’s nothing wrong with riding in some hiking shorts or old cut-off jeans, but we prefer to wear shorts that are specifically designed to be worn while mountain biking. Durable materials that are lightweight, quick-drying, and stretchy are combined with mountain bike specific cuts with waist articulation and high crotch gussets to provide on the bike comfort and freedom of movement. Quality mountain bike shorts will help you regulate temperature and moisture so you stay comfortable throughout the course of a ride, reduce the chances of irritation and chafing while pedaling, and provide leg coverage and protection from the sun, trailside obstacles, and unexpected encounters with the dirt.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why are mountain bike shorts so expensive?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>The price of mountain bike shorts varies pretty significantly, but like any outdoor apparel designed for a specific purpose, they can be pretty expensive. Technical fabrics, finishes, designs, and construction methods are the primary reasons that they can cost as much as they do. Thankfully, there are lots of options, with less sophisticated, entry-level shorts usually coming in around $80-$100, and more expensive shorts costing as much as double. If you’re operating on a budget, you can often find great deals on last year’s models or during end-of-season sales to save significant amounts of cash. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Should I wear padded liner shorts?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>There’s no rule that says you have to wear padded liner shorts when you ride, but they definitely exist for a reason. Given that mountain biking takes place on rough trails and uneven terrain and we spend lots of time seated and pedaling on trail rides, adding a bit of cushioning between your body and your bike saddle can help to enhance and maintain your comfort while riding. By adding some cushioning, padded shorts help absorb some impact, help to avoid pressure points, and can reduce or prevent irritation, chafing, and sores that may otherwise develop. Another bonus is that padded liner shorts are generally pretty snug fitting, and they can help to keep sensitive parts of the male anatomy tucked up and out of the way, reducing unwanted and uncomfortable encounters with the saddle.  </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-helmet/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"mountain bike helmets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Mountain Bike Helmets of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The best mountain bike shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Mountain Bike Shoes of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shorts/\">The Best Mountain Bike Shorts of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"9054ce397a2695fed8aed7e85e53c4079ed1afd0e9f50ed0a554a6c57d5bf6fb","category":"Cycling"}
