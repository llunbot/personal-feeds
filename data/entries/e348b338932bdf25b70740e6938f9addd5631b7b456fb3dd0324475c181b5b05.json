Both the Telephoto and front cameras shoot at 12 megapixels on iPhone 16 Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe also expects the iPhone 17 Pro models to be equipped with 12GB of RAM, up from 8GB in iPhone 16 Pro models. This increase in memory would contribute to improved performance for Apple Intelligence and multitasking.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe analyst continues to believe that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a \"much narrowed Dynamic Island,\" as a result of the device adopting a smaller \"metalens\" for the Face ID system. This would be the first size reduction for the Dynamic Island since it debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu outlined a few less-surprising details that are apparently planned for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, including unchanged 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch display sizes for the devices, respectively. He also expects the devices to have an A19 Pro chip manufactured with TSMC's same 3nm process as used for the A18 Pro chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 Pro models in September 2025, alongside a regular iPhone 17 and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/\">all-new, slimmer \"iPhone 17 Air.\"</a><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-pro-rumored-features/\">iPhone 17 Pro Models Again Rumored to Feature 48MP Telephoto Camera, 12GB of RAM, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-models-again-rumored-to-feature-48mp-telephoto-camera-12gb-of-ram-and-more.2440428/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e348b338932bdf25b70740e6938f9addd5631b7b456fb3dd0324475c181b5b05","category":"Apple"}
