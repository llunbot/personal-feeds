{"title":"Breathable 1.0","link":"https://breathable.app/","date":1626908605000,"content":"\n<p>New app from Garrett Murray (who <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/garrett+murray\">should be familiar</a> to long-time readers):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Air quality has become an increasing concern for many people\naround the globe. While stressing about it constantly isn’t\nnecessarily helpful, the goal of the Breathable widget is to\nprovide a quick, glanceable answer to a new daily question: Is it\nsafe to go outside?</p>\n\n<p>Breathable can use AQI data from two services: <a href=\"https://iqair.com/\">IQAir.com</a> and,\noptionally, <a href=\"https://airnow.gov/\">AirNow.gov</a> (in the USA). Both of these services offer\nfree accounts and API access for personal use. Breathable uses the\nUnited States Air Quality Index for all values world-wide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The entire point of Breathable is to offer widgets — the app itself just lets you configure how the widgets look. Brilliantly simple, and in a way, fun, with its clever “emoji scale”. I started using it last week after Murray pinged me about it, but only because I was interested in the idea of a widget-only weather app — Philadelphia generally doesn’t have air quality issues. I should have known better. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1417614057813725185\">Turns out</a>, the whole world now has air quality issues.</p>\n\n<p>Breathable costs just $2, and Murray is donating a portion of the proceeds to foundations focused on climate change initiatives.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/21/breathable\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"58c1a80dd630c61a541d5b578e531da8c67bef3c96df4fa8a123972d5edb1125","category":"Tech"}
