There’s a huge range to choose from with no brand’s range complete without a gravel bike. Many bike makers have two or three different gravel platforms to cater for different gravel riding styles.</p>\n<p>The ability to deliver flex where it’s needed and stiffness where it can aid pedalling efficiency mean that carbon fibre is an ideal material from which to construct gravel bikes. Carbon fibre also has the ability to reduce vibration transmitted to the rider and micro-suspension elements can be built into the carbon lay-up to further aid comfort.</p>\n<p>Below is quite a long list of the best carbon road bikes, all rated and reviewed by our expert testers who between them have clocked up thousands of riding hours and have years of experience.</p>\n<p>You can skip to the end to read our <a href=\"#buyersguide\">buyer’s guide to the different types of carbon gravel bikes</a> and how carbon gravel bikes compare to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">best gravel bikes</a> made from other <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-frame-materials/\">frame materials</a>.</p>\n<h2>The best carbon gravel bikes in 2023</h2>\n<h3>Boardman ADV 9.0</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Boardman ADV 9.0 gravel bike - BikeRadar Value Bike of the Year 2021\" title=\"Boardman ADV 9.0 07\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Boardman ADV 9.0 is one of our favourite bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£1,800 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent value; great ride quality; low weight is impressive for the price</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Sharp edges on stem</li>\n</ul><p>The value for money offered by the Boardman ADV 9.0 is exceptional and made it the winner of BikeRadar’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/tags/boty-2021/\">Bike of the Year</a> Best Value award in 2021.

The choice of Ultegra over GRX feels like a mis-step too and leads to excess chain slap and chatter.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/pivot-vault-review-2/\">Read our full Pivot Vault review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Salsa Warbird C GRX 600 v4</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><h3><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Salsa Warbird all-road bike\" title=\"Salsa Warbird - 01\" /></div>\n    <div>\n    <span>\n                    <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div></h3>\n<ul><li>£3,300 / $3,500 as tested</li>\n<li>Sharp handling</li>\n<li>Many mounting points for bags</li>\n<li>Well thought-out spec</li>\n</ul><p>Salsa is on its fourth iteration of the Warbird, which was one of the first gravel-oriented drop bar bikes built to race, although ten years later it’s morphed into more of an all-rounder gravel bike with 45c x 700c or 2.1″ x 650b tyre clearance and an excess of mounting points to increase versatility.</p>\n<p>This base model has a Shimano GRX RX600 groupset, alloy WTB rims in Shimano hubs and Teravail Cannonball 42mm tyres.

But increasingly, gravel bikes are dividing into clans.</p>\n<p>At one end are gravel race bikes. Driven by the ever-increasing popularity of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/gravel-racing/\">gravel racing</a>, these are bikes designed to travel fast and light off-road. They often include aero features and have geometries that allow you to ride faster, often with more limited tyre clearance. They’re typified by the Pinarello Grevil F, Scott Addict Gravel and several other bikes above.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Revolt X Advanced Pro 1 gravel bike\" title=\"Giant Revolt X Advanced Pro 1 - 13\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Giant Revolt X is inclined towards more technical riding, with a dropper post and a suspension fork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum are gravel bikes designed for more technical riding. These have big tyre clearance, often run on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/650b-vs-700c-for-gravel/\">650b wheels</a>, have sub-1:1 gearing and may include a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-dropper-posts/\">dropper post</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-suspension/\">suspension fork</a>. The Giant Revolt X is a good example. Based on the Giant Revolt all-rounder, the Revolt X’s added features incline it much more towards technical riding.</p>\n<p>Yet another category of gravel bikes is geared towards bikepacking and multi-day off-road adventures. As with the more technical gravel bikes, they often include 650b wheels and wide tyres, to provide a comfortable ride when loaded up and very low gearing to help carry the extra weight up hills. The Salsa Warbird and Vitus Substance CRX are examples above that cater well for this style of riding.</p>\n<h3>What are the advantages of carbon gravel bikes?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Diverge STR Expert gravel bike review BikeRadar riding shots 6\" title=\"Specialized Diverge STR Expert gravel bike review BikeRadar riding shots 6\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Carbon gravel bikes like the Specialized Diverge STR have unique systems built into the frame.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One of the main advantages of carbon gravel bikes over gravel bikes made of other materials is the ability to make them lightweight and compliant while still stiff enough to pedal efficiently.</p>\n<p>Carbon fibre lends itself to the construction of bikes with tuned ride characteristics, as the carbon lay-up can be adjusted to provide flex or vibration absorption where it’s needed but stiffness where it aids efficient progress.</p>\n<p>Often a standard frame design caters for this, but in bikes such as the Cannondale Topstone Carbon and the Specialized Diverge STR, there are more active suspension elements built in that take advantage of carbon fibre’s ability to flex under load without needing the hinges that feature in mountain bike suspension, thus saving significant weight.</p>\n<h3>Are carbon gravel bikes strong enough for off-road riding?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ridley Kanzo Adventure Rival XPLR gravel bike\" title=\"Ridley Kanzo Adventure Rival XPLR - 15\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Manufacturers have learnt how to strengthen carbon fibre bikes for off-road riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There was understandable initial caution about using carbon fibre for off-road applications. This was even more pronounced in the mountain bike market than for gravel bikes and it’s only in the last few years that carbon-framed MTBs have become prevalent.</p>\n<p>But manufacturers have learned where to strengthen bikes for off-road riding, adding more carbon fibre in areas more prone to damage, such as the underside of the down tube. Some brands, such as BMC, add extra frame protection to these areas.</p>\n<p>Although carbon gravel bikes are strengthened against impact damage, it’s still possible to write off a carbon gravel bike frame in a heavy crash, usually due to delamination of the carbon layers.</p>\n<h3>How do carbon gravel bikes compare to aluminium gravel bikes?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Factor Ostro Gravel bike\" title=\"Factor Ostro Gravel - 15\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Carbon gravel bikes tend to be lighter, more compliant and pricier than their aluminium siblings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It’s a generalisation, but in general, carbon gravel bikes are lighter and more compliant than aluminium gravel bikes, leading to a better ride quality. They’re also usually more expensive, as carbon fibre construction is more labour-intensive than welding alloy frames and the raw materials are more expensive too.</p>\n<p>Carbon fibre tends to be used for more specialist designs, whereas aluminium gravel bikes are often lower-priced all-rounders.</p>\n<h3>What about carbon gravel bikes vs titanium gravel bikes?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Reilly Gradient road gravel bike\" title=\"Reilly Gradient\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Titanium gravel bikes tend to be all-rounders, but carbon gravel bikes tend to be more specialist.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robert Smith</i></span></div>\n<p>The price differential between carbon gravel bikes and titanium gravel bikes is less than between carbon and aluminium and many carbon gravel bikes will undercut the price of titanium gravel bikes. That’s because titanium is an expensive metal both to buy and to manufacture cycle frames from.</p>\n<p>There are fewer titanium gravel bike models produced than carbon ones and they often come from titanium specialists, while pretty much every brand that sells carbon bikes will have a carbon gravel bike in its range.</p>\n<p>The smaller market volumes mean that titanium gravel bikes tend to be all-rounders rather than specialist designs.</p>\n<p>Titanium gravel bikes, in general, have a reputation for ride comfort, as titanium, rather like steel, will flex a little under load and damp out vibrations from the surface. Titanium doesn’t rust and the raw metal finish of many titanium gravel bikes is aesthetically appealing. It also has high fatigue resistance and can withstand bashes better than aluminium, carbon or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-steel-gravel-bikes/\">steel gravel bikes</a>.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"21284d08e49e1fd956d587d37579fd94e892fc86b5f42b8f5b5ebd4cad41d70b","category":"Cycling"}
