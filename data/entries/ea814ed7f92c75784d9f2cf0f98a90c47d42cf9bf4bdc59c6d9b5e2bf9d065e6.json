{"title":"Siri Can Start a Screen Recording in iOS 16.5 Beta 1","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/ios-16-5-siri-screen-recording/","date":1680031223000,"content":"With <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/apple-seeds-ios-16-5-beta-1-to-developers/\">the iOS 16.5 beta</a>, Apple is working to improve <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>'s functionality, and there is a new option to start a screen recording with the voice assistant. As noted by <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/03/28/ios-16-5-beta-enables-screen-recording-via-siri-video/\">9to5Mac</a></em>, you can now say \"Hey ‌Siri‌, start a screen recording\" to use the Screen Record feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg\" alt width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" />\r<br />\nUsing this command will cause the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s screen to be automatically video recorded until you tap in to turn it off or activate ‌Siri‌ and say \"Stop the screen recording.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that the wording of the screen recording command needs to be fairly specific as something like \"take a screen recording\" results in a screenshot rather than the video recording function. ‌Siri‌ has been able to take a standard screenshot for quite some time, but the screen recording function is definitely new in this beta.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn prior versions of iOS, when you ask ‌Siri‌ to start a screen recording, the voice assistant does a web search or says you have no such app installed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 16.5 was provided to developers today and it should be coming to public beta testers later this week. Aside from the ‌Siri‌ screen recording feature, Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/apple-news-app-sports-tab-ios-16-5/\">also added a Sports tab</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/\">Apple News</a> app. No other new additions have been found as of yet.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/ios-16-5-siri-screen-recording/\">Siri Can Start a Screen Recording in iOS 16.5 Beta 1</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/siri-can-start-a-screen-recording-in-ios-16-5-beta-1.2385128/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ea814ed7f92c75784d9f2cf0f98a90c47d42cf9bf4bdc59c6d9b5e2bf9d065e6","category":"Apple"}
