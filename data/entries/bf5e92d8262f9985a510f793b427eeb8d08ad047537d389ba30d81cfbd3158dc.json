While the first season felt smaller and quieter—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/review-house-of-the-dragon-prequel-series-makes-a-solid-debut/\">in a good way</a>, more focused on character relationships and political maneuvering—the show seems to be pulling out all the stops in S2 as all-out war breaks out in the legendary \"Dance of Dragons.\"</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/tensions-rise-between-targaryens-in-first-teaser-for-house-of-the-dragon-s2/\">previously reported</a>, the series is set nearly 200 years before the events of <em>Game of Thrones </em>and chronicles the beginning of the end of House Targaryen's reign. The primary source material is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%26_Blood_(novel)\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fire and Blood</em></a>, a fictional history of the Targaryen kings written by George R.R. Martin. As book readers know, those events culminated in a civil war and the extinction of the dragons—at least until Daenerys Targaryen came along.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024395#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024395&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bf5e92d8262f9985a510f793b427eeb8d08ad047537d389ba30d81cfbd3158dc","category":"Tech"}
