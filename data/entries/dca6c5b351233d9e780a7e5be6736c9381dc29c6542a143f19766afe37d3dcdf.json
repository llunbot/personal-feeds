This device is now reportedly in active development and Gurman expects it to arrive \"between the fall of 2025 and spring of 2026.\" Earlier this month, Apple supply chain analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/apple-vision-pro-with-m5-chip-rumor/\">similarly said</a> that Apple is planning to release an updated Vision Pro with the M5 chip and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> support in 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current, first-generation Vision Pro headset contains the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip, which launched in 2022. By 2026, Apple's \"M6\" chips will likely already be on the horizon. A <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-may-stop-producing-vision-pro-by-end-of-2024/\">recent report</a> from <em>The Information</em> suggested that the second-generation Vision Pro will largely re-use stockpiled parts from the first-generation model with \"limited changes to its physical design.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman added that Apple has signed up its employees to help evaluate the smart glasses market and how consumers feel about it. This includes devices such as Snapchat Spectacles and Meta Ray-Bans, which let users record video, make phone calls, and listen to music. Gurman speculated that Apple could create a version of its AirPods in a glasses form factor.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m5/\">M5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/vision-pro-2-with-m5-may-not-launch-until-2026/\">Apple Vision Pro 2 With M5 Chip May Not Launch Until 2026</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-2-with-m5-chip-may-not-launch-until-2026.2442603/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dca6c5b351233d9e780a7e5be6736c9381dc29c6542a143f19766afe37d3dcdf","category":"Apple"}
