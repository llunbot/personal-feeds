Tesla will automatically install the Apple Watch version for users who update the companion app on their iPhones later this month as the new version rolls out. Users of Wear OS devices currently have no timeline for receiving a similar app. The watchOS app is part of Tesla's broader annual holiday update, which includes features like remote access to Sentry Mode recordings and improvements to navigation. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>Update:</b> As of December 3, the Tesla app for Apple Watch is available for download. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tesla/\">Tesla</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/02/tesla-app-for-apple-watch-coming-this-month/\">Tesla App for Apple Watch Coming This Month [Update: Now Available]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tesla-app-for-apple-watch-coming-this-month-update-now-available.2444458/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d326bb2b30328d90c88b0b6481e154376e6ef7078fc03a8e3fd61b8afb55073a","category":"Apple"}
