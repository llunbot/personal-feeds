I wanted to know more how Fulcrum claimed to quantify such a subjective ‘feeling’, so I pressed them on it. And Fulcrum responded with a good explanation of their “<em>new parameters in the pursuit of the perfect formula</em>“, a way of making ‘ride feel’ an objective data point:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>After extensive research by the R&amp;D department with specific wheels, tested through a dynamic analysis of riders with different physical characteristics in numerous riding conditions, we have defined two performance indexes: HANDLING and REACTIVITY.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The physical quantities used to define these indexes are mass (kg), rotational inertia (kg/m2), flexural stiffness (N/mm) and torsional stiffness (Nm/rad), whilst the joule (J) is used to measure the energy dissipated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HANDLING considers the energy dissipated by the wheel during a change in direction. The less energy is dissipated the higher the performance index. The handling assessment considers the flexural deformation based on rolling and inclination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>REACTIVITY considers the energy dissipated by the wheel during a sprint, therefore the flexural deformation and torsional deformation based on the translation, rolling and inclination energies. In other words, the rider’s pedal stroke deforms the wheel and the energy absorbed for the deformation is not transferred to the ground to move forward. The greater the amount of energy absorbed the lower the reactivity and therefore the performance of the wheel.</p>\n<cite><em>– Federico Gardin, Fulcrum</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_photo-by-Ruppert-Fowler_Bike-Connection-Agency_MAMIL-riding-with-Greg-on-Colnagos.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_photo-by-Ruppert-Fowler_Bike-Connection-Agency_MAMIL-riding-with-Greg-on-Colnagos-800x444.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Fulcrum Speed 42 57 lightweight aero carbon road bike wheels, group riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_photo-by-Ruppert-Fowler_Bike-Connection-Agency_MAMIL-riding-with-Greg-on-Colnagos-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_photo-by-Ruppert-Fowler_Bike-Connection-Agency_MAMIL-riding-with-Greg-on-Colnagos-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_photo-by-Ruppert-Fowler_Bike-Connection-Agency_MAMIL-riding-with-Greg-on-Colnagos-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_photo-by-Ruppert-Fowler_Bike-Connection-Agency_MAMIL-riding-with-Greg-on-Colnagos-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_photo-by-Ruppert-Fowler_Bike-Connection-Agency_MAMIL-riding-with-Greg-on-Colnagos-1536x853.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_photo-by-Ruppert-Fowler_Bike-Connection-Agency_MAMIL-riding-with-Greg-on-Colnagos.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption><em>photo by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/roofowler/\" target=\"_blank\">Rupert Fowler</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bikeconnectionagency/\" target=\"_blank\">Bike Connection Agency</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fulcrum’s concept was to try to establish a way to illustrate characteristics in each generation of wheels, and to help riders better differentiate their wheels. Simply put, a wheel can either be <em>Reactive</em> or <em>Comfortable</em>, but NOT both. “A higher flexural stiffness results in greater reactivity, whilst low stiffness is synonymous with comfort.” Stiffer isn’t necessarily better, so Fulcrum set out to better quantify the ultimate characteristics they feel define that ideal balance for a certain rider and riding style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what all is really new?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_rim-profiles.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_rim-profiles-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Fulcrum Speed 42 57 lightweight aero carbon road bike wheels, rim details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_rim-profiles-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_rim-profiles-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_rim-profiles-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_rim-profiles-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_rim-profiles-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Fulcrum-Speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels_rim-profiles.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, both new Fulcrum Speed wheels are 2mm deeper, now coming in 42mm &amp; 57mm depths. Then, they are 4mm wider inside, now with a 2-Way-fit 23mm hooked tubeless bead that can be used with tubeless or tube-type tires.
