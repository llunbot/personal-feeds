But it comes with a price: Gone is the MacBook Air’s longstanding Space Gray option, which means that Apple no longer offers any new Mac in Space Gray.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Space Gray made its debut on the iPhone 5s in 2013 (which we referred to as “something called ‘space gray'” <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/221839/apple-unveils-powerful-iphone-5s-and-entry-level-5c.html\">when it was introduced</a>). The first Mac in Space Gray was the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667307/1-1-ghz-apple-macbook-early-2015-review.html\">12-inch MacBook in 2015</a>, which we described as a “serious and sophisticated finish”–we also erroneously wrote it as “grey” and not “gray” as Apple puts it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Space Gray had only one name during its tenure, it took on different shades over the years. Sometimes it was lighter and nearly silver, other times it was darker and closer to black. Which was an odd thing for Apple, a company that prides itself in its design consistency. Apple has not commented on the end of Space Gray, and just because it’s no longer offered on a Mac right now doesn’t mean it’s gone forever. Apple could decide to revive it someday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s Mac color choices are bright and colorful (with one darker Midnight option) on the consumer side, metallic shades on the pro side, and silver for the tween-ish Mac mini. If you really want a Space Gray Mac, you have to settle for older models at third-party retailers or in the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\">Apple Certified Refurbished Store</a>. However, Space Gray still lives on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2626371/really-the-new-ipad-air-has-a-new-chip-and-thats-it.html\">iPad Air</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2504744/ipad-mini-a17-pro-review.html\">iPad mini</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel like mourning the loss of Space Gray on the Mac, please enjoy the Space Gray memorial slideshow below.
