However, the experienced booster had a shortfall of stability and tipped over shortly following touchdown.</p>\n<p>Prior to Wednesday's landing failure, SpaceX had landed 267 boosters in a row. The company's last failure occurred in February 2021. The cause of the failure was not immediately clear, and SpaceX said \"teams are assessing the booster's flight data and status.\" <a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/launches/mission/?missionId=sl-8-6\">Based on video of the landing</a>, it is possible there was an engine burn timing issue.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045775#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045775&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aff90d1977e884a2b2683334eb8955177b5337d1a361b5a68109a07c26749f34","category":"Tech"}
