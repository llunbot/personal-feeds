But you can also use its scripting engine to \"amplify your game\" and set up \"GamePacks\" to do things like reduce recoil animations in games like Call of Duty<em>.</em> And that is where Cronus seems to have gotten into trouble.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1750238590213193843\">first noted</a> by the Call of Duty news channel CharlieIntel, the latest update to the PlayStation 5's system (24.01-08.60.00) software blocks the Cronus from connecting. The update is \"NOT mandatory,\" Cronus claims in a notice on its website, so Zen players can hold off and keep playing. Still, there is \"currently no timetable on a fix … it could be 24 (hours), 24 days, 24 months, we won't know until we've dug into it.\" There is, for now, a \"<a href=\"https://guide.cronus.support/remote-play-workaround\">Remote Play Workaround</a>\" for those already too far updated.</p>\n<p>Ars attempted to reach Cronus for comment and reached out to Sony as well and will update this post with any new information.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998976#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998976&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cdc847dd5941080b01d427a674176da77184c39abc51b38a2b1617f4efe5eafc","category":"Tech"}
