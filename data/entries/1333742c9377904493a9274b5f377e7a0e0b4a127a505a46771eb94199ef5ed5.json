It started a couple of years ago with XC wheels. But now Bike Ahead add tougher EN wheels to handle heavier bikes and more trail abuse, plus even lighter SL wheels for cross-country weight weenies to shed even more grams.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bike-Ahead-Three-Zero-EN-XC-SL-lightweight-carbon-mountain-wheels_made-in-Germany_Safe-Wind-Design-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bike-Ahead-Three-Zero-EN-XC-SL-lightweight-carbon-mountain-wheels_made-in-Germany_Safe-Wind-Design-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bike Ahead Three Zero EN XC SL lightweight carbon cross-country trail enduro all-mountain wheels, made-in-Germany, patented Safe-Wing-Design\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bike-Ahead-Three-Zero-EN-XC-SL-lightweight-carbon-mountain-wheels_made-in-Germany_Safe-Wind-Design-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bike-Ahead-Three-Zero-EN-XC-SL-lightweight-carbon-mountain-wheels_made-in-Germany_Safe-Wind-Design-297x134.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bike-Ahead-Three-Zero-EN-XC-SL-lightweight-carbon-mountain-wheels_made-in-Germany_Safe-Wind-Design-1536x691.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bike-Ahead-Three-Zero-EN-XC-SL-lightweight-carbon-mountain-wheels_made-in-Germany_Safe-Wind-Design-120x54.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bike-Ahead-Three-Zero-EN-XC-SL-lightweight-carbon-mountain-wheels_made-in-Germany_Safe-Wind-Design-768x346.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The core of the Bike Ahead’s Three Zero range is the unique (and patented) Safe-Wing rim design. It features a relatively straight &amp; tall hookless interface where it contacts the tire bead, with small radius curves to lock onto the tire offering a secure fit and good support so you can get the most grip out of your tire with confidence, even at extremely low pressures. But on the outside of the rim, a much larger radius means a more rounded profile so pinch flats and sidewall cuts are much less likely when you hit a sharp-edged obstacle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech

The Bike Ahead Three Zero EN &amp; XC wheels both sell for the same 1900€ price tag, with DT Swiss 240 EXP hubs. And for the gram-counters, the SL wheels get upgraded to DT 180 EXP hubs with SINC ceramic bearings to get even lighter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bike Ahead offers a 2-year warranty on the wheels, plus a discounted 3-year crash replacement program, as well. Or if you buy the wheels directly from Bike-Ahead.com, they extend the warranty to 3 years, and crash replacement to 5 years from the date of purchase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All mountain bike wheels include tubeless tape and tubeless valves, and the choice of Shimano MicroSpline or SRAM XD freehub bodies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bike-ahead-composites.de/home.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bike-Ahead.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bike-ahead-builds-3-lightweight-three-zero-mountain-bike-wheelsets-from-xc-to-enduro/\">Bike Ahead Builds 3 Lightweight Three Zero Mountain Bike Wheelsets from XC to Enduro</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1333742c9377904493a9274b5f377e7a0e0b4a127a505a46771eb94199ef5ed5","category":"Cycling"}
