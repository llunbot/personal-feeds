You’ll also get an excellent camera system with a 48MP main lens and a 12MP ultra-wide lens. It doesn’t have a telephoto camera like the Pro models, but Apple’s computational advancements allow it to have 2x zoom enabled by quad-pixel sensor. And of course, you’ll get years of updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We gave the iPhone 15 4 stars in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2247687/iphone-15-review.html\">2024 review</a>, calling it “another example of Apple’s straightforward excellence.” And our opinion hasn’t changed a year later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since this iPhone isn’t brand new, it’s not eligible for AppleCare, but it’s not refurbished either. Woot promises that the phone is in “Pristine” condition and has “never been in customer hands.” It will have “a test sticker showing 100% battery life and inside a sleek custom black box, not the original retail packaging.” It comes with a one-year warranty from Apple but again, it’s not eligible for AppleCare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want a great iPhone at a great price without needing to jump through carrier hoops, go grab this deal before it’s gone forever.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2600405/this-unlocked-512gb-iphone-15-is-more-than-300-off-right-now.html\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3b28caf1d3009eac6212812d572e46d02805aba1c0699a9842af4adc7d8b515a","category":"Apple"}
