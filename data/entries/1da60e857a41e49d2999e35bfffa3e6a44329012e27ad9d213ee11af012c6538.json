A laptop is placed in the middle on the flexible part, which pulls the legs together to secure it upright using the weight of the laptop.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTwelve South says that the design <a href=\"https://www.northcharleston.org/government/projects/noisette-creek-pedestrian-bridge/\">was inspired by</a> the Noisette Creek Pedestrian Bridge in Charleston, South Carolina. The bridge has two steel arches that are indeed similar to the design of the BookArc Flex.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe were able to test the BookArc Flex ahead of its launch, and while the design works well, it is important to ensure the laptop goes directly in the center of the stand. It's not difficult to do, and placing the laptop correctly ensures that it remains secure. If it's not placed in the center, however, it can shift out of place, though a misalignment is quickly noticeable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe construction of the BookArc Flex allows it to work with laptops of multiple sizes without different inserts, and it is compatible with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> and MacBook Pro from Apple. The slim size of the BookArc Flex ensures that it does not take up too much room on a desk, and it tucks a MacBook out of the way when used in clamshell mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTwelve South's BookArc Flex is priced starting at $50 it is available today <a href=\"https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/bookarc-flex\">from the Twelve South website</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twelve-south/\">Twelve South</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/twelve-south-bookarc-flex/\">Twelve South Launches New BookArc Flex</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/twelve-south-launches-new-bookarc-flex.2416548/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1da60e857a41e49d2999e35bfffa3e6a44329012e27ad9d213ee11af012c6538","category":"Apple"}
