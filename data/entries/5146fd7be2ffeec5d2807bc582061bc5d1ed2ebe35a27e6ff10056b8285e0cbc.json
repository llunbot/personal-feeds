Windows 10 21H2 was released at roughly the same time as Windows 11, and Windows 10 22H2 arrived a year later.</p>\n<p>But version 22H2 will be the end of the road for Windows 10, according to a <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/windows-client-roadmap-update/ba-p/3805227\">road map update</a> posted yesterday. Microsoft product manager Jason Leznek reiterated that Windows 10 will continue to receive security updates until the October 2025 cutoff date, but there will be no more yearly feature updates for Windows 10.</p>\n<p>“As documented on the Windows 10 Enterprise and Education and Windows 10 Home and Pro lifecycle pages, Windows 10 will reach end of support on October 14, 2025,” writes Leznek. “The current version, 22H2, will be the final version of Windows 10, and all editions will remain in support with monthly security update releases through that date.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935420#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935420&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5146fd7be2ffeec5d2807bc582061bc5d1ed2ebe35a27e6ff10056b8285e0cbc","category":"Tech"}
