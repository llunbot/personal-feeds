The rise in popularity of the EDM genre has also resulted in an increasing number of remixes, mash-ups, and DJ mixes that incorporate samples from other songs, making working out who should be compensated even harder.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌Apple Music‌ originally introduced DJ mixes and mash-ups in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/15/apple-music-dubset-remixes-dj-mixes/\">2016</a> through a partnership with Dubset Media Holdings to identify and pay for licensed music within mixes. Now, Apple is using the Shazam technology it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/11/apple-acquires-shazam/\">acquired</a> in 2018 to identify and compensate everyone whose content appears in a mix.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>\"Apple Music is the first platform that offers continuous mixes where there's a fair fee involved for the artists whose tracks are included in the mixes and for the artist making those mixes,\" DJ Charlotte de Witte told TechCrunch on behalf of Apple. \"It's a step in the right direction where everyone gets treated fairly. I'm beyond excited to have the chance to provide online mixes again.\"</blockquote>As part of the rollout, Apple is showcasing the thousands of mixes already available on the service within its dedicated genre section for DJ mixes within the ‌Apple Music‌ app. Studio K7!'s DJ Kicks archive of mixes will also start rolling out on ‌Apple Music‌, giving users access to mixes that haven't been on the market in over 15 years.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new technology will also let ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers see the names of individual tracks within a streamed mix, as well as give them the ability to skip or save the songs for listening offline. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/apple-music-shazam-pay-dj-mixes/\">Apple Music Now Uses Shazam Technology to Pay Rights Holders in DJ Mixes</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-now-uses-shazam-technology-to-pay-rights-holders-in-dj-mixes.2310266/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=czpwhZ1eKQA:2I6RG9CA09U:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=czpwhZ1eKQA:2I6RG9CA09U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/czpwhZ1eKQA\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"847d9d8881f692252f622213881b63eff28fc2461f733035b876fc29f229e026","category":"Apple"}
