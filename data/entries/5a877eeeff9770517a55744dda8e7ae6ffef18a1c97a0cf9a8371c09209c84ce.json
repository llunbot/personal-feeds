From 1984 through the end of the shuttle era, the agency used a modified Airstream motor home, known as the \"Astrovan,\" to ferry crews to the launch pad. This iconic vehicle had a shiny, silvery exterior but a fairly spartan interior. \"The current vehicle's appeal is rooted in its tradition rather than its d√©cor,\" <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/flyout/astrovan.html\">the agency acknowledged in 2011</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, NASA is gearing up for a new era of deep space exploration, and it plans to launch four astronauts at a time inside the Orion spacecraft, on top of a Space Launch System rocket. The first human flights on these vehicles could occur in late 2023 or early 2024, NASA administrator Bill Nelson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SciGuySpace/status/1440387292632260615\">recently said</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798199#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798199&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5a877eeeff9770517a55744dda8e7ae6ffef18a1c97a0cf9a8371c09209c84ce","category":"Tech"}
