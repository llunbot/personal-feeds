Doesn’t it feel like every cycling brand is getting into expensive, branded off-bike kit these days? Yes, this is very expensive lounge wear and casual riding gear. But at least it looks like solid performance natural and recycled synthetic fabrics, all manufactured in the EU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Some international clarification informs us that the merino sweats do come in other colors in the US. Oh, and a 40% Off Winter Sale means the regular high prices are much more affordable while discount last.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what does Velocio actually have in mind for Recon? And is it really worth it?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why casual lifestyle wear for cyclists?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_bike-to-train-to-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_bike-to-train-to-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Recon casual technical lifestyle clothing loungewear, not only for cycling, around town, too\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_bike-to-train-to-bike.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_bike-to-train-to-bike-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_bike-to-train-to-bike-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_bike-to-train-to-bike-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_bike-to-train-to-bike-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_bike-to-train-to-bike-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Velocio)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, now that some Arctic air has descended over much of Europe for a bitter return of winter, I’m longing for some warm and cozy kit to lounge around in. Before mustering up the courage to head out into the snow on a fat bike ride, or to brave a frosty gravel ride, the thought of warm off-the-bike gear is appealing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to me, it looks like the Velocio Recon casual line-up is high on quality materials, low-key on branding, and offers a nicely wide size range. Even if the prices are pretty high, backed up by being made entirely in Europe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A current 40% off discount sale seems to apply to the Recon merino goodies. Use code: WINTERSALE24 at checkout.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It even packs in some functional details that would make for good use on bike commuters, or maybe even more chill casual riding like bikepacking.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Velocio Recon casual merino lifestyle clothes, not just for cycling</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_cozy-merino-sweats.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_cozy-merino-sweats.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Recon casual technical lifestyle clothing loungewear, black merino blend sweatpants &amp; sweatshirts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_cozy-merino-sweats.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_cozy-merino-sweats-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_cozy-merino-sweats-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_cozy-merino-sweats-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_cozy-merino-sweats-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_cozy-merino-sweats-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Velocio describes the lifestyle kit as “providing warmth and practical style for the winter months”. It may be casual, but it is still quite technical – composed of a mix of natural merino wool and a number of recycled synthetic fabrics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Women &amp; men both get 4 core pieces of clothing in the new Recon range, plus some 27€ winter wool socks to wrap it up. Plus, women’s lifestyle also gets all-synthetic Stealth Leggings and Luxe Bras beyond the new Recon family, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the more active side there are Recon Stealth Pants and a Recon Hoodie. And for more lounging around, there are the Recon Merino Sweat Pants and Crew Sweatshirt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, women also get the all-synthetic $111 compression Stealth Leggings and 65€ Luxe Bras in more color options, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Recon Sweats</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Sweatpants.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1250\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Sweatpants.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Recon casual lifestyle gear for cyclists, Recon Merino Sweatpants\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Sweatpants.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Sweatpants-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Sweatpants-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Sweatpants-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Sweatpants-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Sweatpants-1536x960.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For those classically styled sweats, you get Women- or Men-specific cuts of heavyweight 285gsm Merino blend, with wool outside (23%) backed by a recycled polyester fleece lining (74%), and a bit of lycra for stretch.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Crew-Sweatshirt-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Crew-Sweatshirt-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Recon casual lifestyle gear for cyclists, Recon Merino Sweatshirt\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Crew-Sweatshirt-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Crew-Sweatshirt-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Crew-Sweatshirt-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Crew-Sweatshirt-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Crew-Sweatshirt-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Crew-Sweatshirt-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Crew-Sweatshirt-2048x1280.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Recon sweatpants &amp; sweatshirts come in wide 8 size range for men (XS-4XL) and women (2XS-3XL). The sweatpants get 2 open side pockets &amp; 2 zippered back pockets. The sweatshirts are more simple, although just the men’s get reinforced elbow patches, but not the women’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> All sell for the same 185€ a piece price, only in black <em>in Europe.

Velocio designed the Recon Stealth pants for riding around town or just everyday wear. They certainly are not cheap at 250€, but for that you get stretch woven bio-polyamide fabric treated with a PFAS-free DWR coating to shed the occasional shower on the commuter to work, and dry quickly after a deluge. The men’s get belt loops and the women’s a wide stretch waistband. Both get 3 zip pockets, plus an open drop-in rear pocket, and subtle reflective detailing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Women pick from navy blue or charcoal gray, while men add a 3rd coffee brown option.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Hoodie.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Hoodie.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Recon casual lifestyle gear for cyclists, Recon Merino Hoodie\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Hoodie.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Hoodie-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Hoodie-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Hoodie-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Hoodie-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-lifestyle-gear-for-cyclists_Recon-Merino-Hoodie-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, back to the merino, there’s the 231€ Wo/Men’s Recon Hoodie. It uses the same colors of heavy Merino blend backed with recycled fleece lining fabric. But the full-length YKK-zip hooded sweatshirt features a slim fit that will even do well on mountain bike rides. And it features two zippered side slash pockets. Plus, a third zip pocket on the lower back to carry essentials while riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_upcoming-merino-sweats-colors-maybe.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_upcoming-merino-sweats-colors-maybe.jpg\" alt=\"Velocio Recon casual technical lifestyle clothing loungewear, not only for cycling, future color tease for merino sweats\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_upcoming-merino-sweats-colors-maybe.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_upcoming-merino-sweats-colors-maybe-297x173.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_upcoming-merino-sweats-colors-maybe-800x467.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_upcoming-merino-sweats-colors-maybe-120x70.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Velocio-Recon-casual-technical-lifestyle-clothing-loungewear_not-only-for-cycling_upcoming-merino-sweats-colors-maybe-768x448.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s it, with an almost even split of being made in Lithuania or Italy. Some colors and sizes are already sold out. But Velocio plan to expand the Lifestyle lineup in 2024. And they say they’ll add more colors to this existing collection, too. A solid hint of those upcoming plans for EU customers, Velocio’s lifestyle pages are littered with images that show a couple more colors of sweats &amp; hoodies as you can already get in the USA…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Use that discount code to save 40% off the Recon sweats &amp; hoodie while it lasts.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://velocio.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Velcio.cc</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/velocio-recon-casual-merino-lifestyle-clothes-not-just-for-cyclists/\">Velocio Recon Casual Merino Lifestyle Gear to Keep Cozy Riding or Lounging, at a High Cost… but with Discounts</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"c6887bf2b3d870ae023a91fe1bf490578f99e8d2aea4f859ee9614c1f71113b0","category":"Cycling"}
