alt=\"Giant Stance 29 2 2023\" title=\"Giant Stance 29 2 2023\" />                                            <p>Giant has released its new Stance mountain bike, now featuring increased suspension travel and more aggressive geometry.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">trail bike</a> continues to use Giant’s Flexpoint flex-stay suspension system, which has been upped from 120mm to 125mm, with the fork increasing from 130mm to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">140mm of travel</a>.</p>\n<p>The new range starts at £1,999 for the Stance 2, which is available in 29in and 27.5in wheel sizes, while the Stance 1 29 is priced at £2,399.</p>\n<p>Giant has yet to confirm international pricing.</p>\n<h2>More travel and inherited hardware</h2>\n<div>\n

full-suspension mountain bike platform, sitting below the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/giant-trance-advanced-pro-29-1-review/\">Trance</a>.</p>\n<p>The new Stance is made from Giant’s ALUXX aluminium, which it says offers high levels of stiffness and durability, while remaining lightweight.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

/>\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rocker link has also had a redesign, making it look more sleek than the previous bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant</i></span></div>\n<p>Its updated frame sees an increase in travel, up 5mm to 125mm, and still uses Giant’s FlexPoint flex-stay suspension system.</p>\n<p>Flex-stay suspension is seen most commonly on smaller-travel <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country bikes</a>, because the system requires fewer pivots, making the frame lighter and more responsive due to the extra rigidity.</p>\n<p>Giant says the FlexPoint system reduces the amount of maintenance needed, while maintaining the smoothness of multi-link suspension linkage.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Stance 29 2023 with Shimano Cues U6000\"

end.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant</i></span></div>\n<p>The bike now features a thru-axle drop-out on the rear, which should make it compatible with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-wheels/\">the best mountain bike wheels</a>, should you wish to upgrade.</p>\n<p>The Stance has also inherited new cable and house ports from Maestro suspension-equipped bikes such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/giant-reign-1-review-4/\">Giant Reign</a>. These enter the frame on the down tube.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Stance 29 2023\" title=\"Giant Stance 29 2023\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mounts under the top tube enable carrying cages to be fitted to the Stance’s frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant</i></span></div>\n<p>Under the top tube, there is now a mount to secure accessories too, such as a spare <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\">inner tube</a>. There’s also a new chainstay protector, which should keep noise from chain slap to a minimum.</p>\n<p>All bikes in the Stance range use Giant’s own Crest 34 SL RCL fork, which has 34mm-wide stanchions and is said to have customised negative coil springs for dedicated small-bump support.</p>\n<p>The fork also features a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-mudguards/\">mudguard</a> mount, which should be useful if you’re riding in rainy climates.</p>\n<p>The Stance gets Giant’s new Contact Switch AT dropper, which offers 30mm of tool-free travel adjustment and features a rotatable actuator, which can be flipped 180 degrees to reduce the bend on the dropper cable.</p>\n<h2>Longer, slacker, better?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\"

replaces.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant</i></span></div>\n<p>The geometry on the Stance has been slackened dramatically, with head angles on both the 29in and 27.5in frames reducing by 2 degrees to 65.5 degrees.</p>\n<p>A slacker head angle should make the bike feel more stable, especially on steeper trails, because the wheel will be pushed further away from the centre of the bike than a bike with a steeper head angle.</p>\n<p>The reach measurement has increased by 16mm to 470mm on a 29in size-large bike, and chainstay lengths have increased by 2mm to 440mm.</p>\n<div>\n
