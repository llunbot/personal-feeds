From the outside, the landing appeared just as it would have if the spacecraft brought home NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who became the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/after-a-successful-launch-boeings-starliner-runs-into-more-helium-leaks/\">first people to launch on a Starliner capsule on June 5</a>.</p>\n<p>But Starliner's cockpit was empty as it flew back to Earth Friday night. Last month, NASA managers decided to keep Wilmore and Williams on the International Space Station (ISS) until next year after agency <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/its-official-nasa-calls-on-crew-dragon-to-rescue-the-starliner-astronauts/\">officials determined it was too risky for the astronauts to return to the ground on Boeing's spaceship</a>. Instead of coming home on Starliner, Wilmore and Williams will fly back to Earth on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft in February. NASA has incorporated the Starliner duo into the space station's long-term crew.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048167#p3\">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048167&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f4f5f44e762ee874be923bdf18c61b44166233a37e68dd22f0616aab414f807f","category":"Tech"}
