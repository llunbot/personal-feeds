Suddenly, a few passengers start to scream. Soon, the captain announces there's a bomb on board, and it’s set to detonate if the aircraft drops below 10,000 feet.</p>\n<p>\"The inside of the plane turned into a battlefield,\" the story reads. \"The captain was visibly startled and vainly tried to calm down the screaming and utterly terrorized passengers.\"</p>\n<p>Only one person keeps his cool: a young North Korean diplomat who has faith that his country will find a solution and save everyone. And he’s right. North Korea's esteemed scientists and engineers create a mysterious anti-gravitational field and stop the plane in mid-air. The bomb is defused, and everyone gets off the aircraft and is brought back safely to Earth.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952074#p3\">Read 47 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952074&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7b03d8584a1885dbe393b20cb12e70b873349b736a9ccce9352db5a2847f1a1e","category":"Tech"}
