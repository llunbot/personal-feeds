Both the 41mm and 45mm casings have the same thicknesses.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile early <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/15/apple-watch-series-7-tidbits-s7-chip-storage/\">specification documents obtained by <em>MacRumors</em></a> revealed many aspects that Apple did not clarify during the announcement of the device, such as the S7 chip, the thickness and exact dimensions were unknown until today.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlleged renders that depicted an ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ with squared-off edges suggested that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-watch-series7-cad-larger-display/\">new model would be 1.7mm thinner</a>, with an overall thickness of 9mm. Contrastingly, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that the Series 7 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/apple-watch-7-thinner-display-borders/\">would be \"slightly thicker overall\" than the Series 6</a>. It is now clear that neither of these rumors turned out to be correct.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>40mm Apple Watch Series 6</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Height: 40mm</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Width: 34mm</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Depth: 10.7mm</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>41mm Apple Watch Series 7</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Height: 41mm</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Width: 35mm</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Depth: 10.7mm</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<div> \r\n<br />\r\n<strong>44mm Apple Watch Series 6</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Height: 44mm</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Width: 38mm</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Depth: 10.7mm</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>45mm Apple Watch Series 7</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Height: 45mm </li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Width: 38mm</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Depth: 10.7mm</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n</div><div></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple says that the casings of the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ have been refined with softer, more rounded edges, but overall the dimensions are very similar to the Series 6. The ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ is available in new 41mm and 45mm size options that are 1mm taller than the 40mm and 44mm options of previous generations.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe smaller 41mm Series 7 model is also 1mm wider than the 40mm Series 6 model, but the 44mm and 45mm models have the same width. Bands from older Apple Watch models continue to be functionally compatible with the Series 7, but these dimensions could indicate that older 38mm or 40mm bands used with the 41mm model may not be completely flush with the casing, although the curvature of the casing may mitigate this issue. This would not be a potential problem with the larger 45mm model since it has the same width as the 44mm model.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/08/apple-watch-series-7-same-thickness-as-series-6/\">Apple Watch Series 7 the Same Thickness as Series 6, Despite Rumors</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-7-the-same-thickness-as-series-6-despite-rumors.2316026/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XFBzGthucjs:zCHFR7EhcYo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XFBzGthucjs:zCHFR7EhcYo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/XFBzGthucjs\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c91d52133aea88b0841e186b0c9b28292d3a819462399f1dc9ac07c5b5bcfd86","category":"Apple"}
