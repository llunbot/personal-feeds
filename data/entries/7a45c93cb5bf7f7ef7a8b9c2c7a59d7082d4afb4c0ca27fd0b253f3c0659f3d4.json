The downloadable content arrives June 21, 2024, and costs $40; preorders are available now (<a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/\">Steam</a>, <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-PPSA04610_00-ELDENRINGSOTEE00\">PlayStation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-pre-order/9n5p5sc2rz7k\">Xbox</a>).</p>\n<p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> takes place in \"The Land of Shadow,\" seemingly a kind of prequel setting to the main <em>Elden Ring, </em>potentially inside a deity's dreams. You can never be too sure, but the presence of certain characters, and the suggestion that you will access the new content by touching the arm of a major but previously unexplored character, suggests you will be traveling through their memories, their dreams, or some combination thereof. The very first image you see is of a player character riding up to a cliff and seeing a flaming treeâ€”perhaps not the Erdtree central to the main game, but a precursor of it that is hinted at in the game's lore.</p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise, there are many new things to notice, including hand-to-hand combat, far more powerful crossbows, new spells and weapons, and a whole host of large, epically detailed, seemingly unfair boss battles.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004796#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004796&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7a45c93cb5bf7f7ef7a8b9c2c7a59d7082d4afb4c0ca27fd0b253f3c0659f3d4","category":"Tech"}
