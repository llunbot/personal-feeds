Apple released the source code for select components of PCC that help implement its security and privacy requirements, which allows for a deeper dive into PCC.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/apple-private-cloud-compute-security.jpg\" width=\"1260\" height=\"626\" />\r<br />\nThe Virtual Research Environment is a set of tools that lets researchers perform their own security analysis on PCC using a Mac. The VRE can be used for inspecting PCC software releases, verifying the consistency of the transparency log, booting a release in a virtualized environment, and modifying and debugging PCC software for deeper investigation. The VRE can be accessed in the macOS 18.1 Developer Preview and can be used with a Mac that has an Apple silicon chip and 16GB+ unified memory.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong with these tools, Apple is expanding its Apple Security Bounty to include rewards for vulnerabilities that demonstrate a compromise of the fundamental privacy and security guarantees of Private Cloud Compute. Security researchers who locate a vulnerability can earn up to $1 million.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/24/apple-private-cloud-compute-security-info/\">Apple Shares Private Cloud Compute Virtual Research Environment, Provides Bounties for Vulnerabilities</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-private-cloud-compute-virtual-research-environment-provides-bounties-for-vulnerabilities.2440882/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e0ee4273d18ccd3c0936421a73ed52231fcb095a5e392c48652f3e69bb323115","category":"Apple"}
