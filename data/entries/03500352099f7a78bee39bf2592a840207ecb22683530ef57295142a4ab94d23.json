We covered the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hutchinson-blackbird-road-tire-review/\">BlackBird</a> last year and were pleasantly surprised by its dry and wet weather grip. The race-focused Blackbird design has the same DNA as the original Blackbird but is fine-tuned for even lower rolling resistance and reduced weight; this one’s race-day ready straight out of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race--jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"8640\" height=\"5760\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hutchinson Blackbird Race\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race--jpg.webp 8640w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race-made-in-france--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race-made-in-france--1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Hutchinson Blackbird Race made in france\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race-made-in-france--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race-made-in-france--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race-made-in-france--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race-made-in-france--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race-made-in-france--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race-made-in-france--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hutchinson-Blackbird-Race-made-in-france--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve seen Hutchinson do this before, first with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-hutchinson-python-3-python-race/\">Python 3 XC tire</a>, which offered a race-only option.
