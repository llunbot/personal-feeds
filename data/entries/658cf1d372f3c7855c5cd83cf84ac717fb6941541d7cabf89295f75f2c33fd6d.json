There are also new features for moving markets and naming audio effects, with Apple's release notes listed below.\r<br />\n<blockquote>- Add color corrections and effects to an adjustment clip above the timeline to apply them to a range of clips at once.\r<br />\n- Get inspired with Image Playground and use Apple Intelligence to quickly create stylized images based on a description, suggested concepts, or people from your Photos library. (Requires macOS 15.2 or later on Mac models with M1 or later.)\r<br />\n- Speed up your Magnetic Mask workflows with important bug fixes, performance improvements, and a new keyboard shortcut to show or hide the Magnetic Mask Editor.\r<br />\n- Use the Quantec QRS (Quantec Room Simulator) effect to create natural and transparent audio reverbs that simulate real acoustic spaces.\r<br />\n- Stay organized by renaming audio effects in the inspector.\r<br />\n- Reveal the source of a multicam angle or synced clip in the browser.\r<br />\n- Move markers in the timeline by dragging them in a clip, or remove markers by dragging them out of a clip.</blockquote>\r<br />\nApple has also updated its Motion and Compressor software that accompanies Final Cut Pro. Motion has ‌Image Playground‌ integration, and Compressor offers machine learning-powered frame rate retiming.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFinal Cut Pro for the Mac can be <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12\">downloaded from the Mac App Store</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/final-cut-pro/\">Final Cut Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/27/final-cut-pro-mac-image-playground/\">Final Cut Pro for Mac Gains Adjustment Clips, Image Playground Integration and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/final-cut-pro-for-mac-gains-adjustment-clips-image-playground-integration-and-more.2454176/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"658cf1d372f3c7855c5cd83cf84ac717fb6941541d7cabf89295f75f2c33fd6d","category":"Apple"}
