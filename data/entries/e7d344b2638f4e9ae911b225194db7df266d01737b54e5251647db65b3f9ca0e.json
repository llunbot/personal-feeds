He continues to expect the next Mac mini to feature a \"revamped\" design, in line with his previous reporting that said the new model will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/mac-mini-redesign-rumor/\">nearly as small as an Apple TV and gain two front-facing USB-C ports</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo major design changes are rumored for the next MacBook Pro and iMac models, but the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro is expected to gain an additional Thunderbolt port compared to the current model, based on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/apple-potentially-facing-worst-leak-since-iphone-4/\">alleged leaks earlier this month</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's not entirely clear if Apple plans to hold an online event this month, like its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/\">\"Scary Fast\" event on October 30 last year</a>, or if the new Macs will be announced with Apple Newsroom press releases only like the iPad mini 7. If there is an event this month, Apple would likely invite the media to watch it online very soon. Apple sent out invites for the October 30 event last year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/\">on October 24</a>, six days in advance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman said the new Macs will be accompanied by unspecified \"USB-C accessories.\" <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris recently discovered code references to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/apple-new-magic-mouse-trackpad-keyboard/\">new versions of the Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard</a>, and these accessories will likely switch from Lightning to USB-C for charging alongside the new iMac. In the EU, a regulation requiring USB-C as a common charging port goes into effect later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is everything that Apple is likely to announce:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li>14-inch MacBook Pro with the standard M4 chip</li>\r<br />\n<li>14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro and M4 Max chip options</li>\r<br />\n<li>iMac with the standard M4 chip</li>\r<br />\n<li>A redesigned, smaller Mac mini with M4 and M4 Pro chip options</li>\r<br />\n<li>Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard accessories with USB-C ports</li></ul><strong>Update:</strong> In a <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1848748246799429753\">follow-up post</a>, Gurman said that Apple is inviting the media and content creators to a hands-on experience in Los Angeles next Wednesday, and he believes this means the new Macs would need to be announced before then.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/22/gurman-says-m4-macs-launch-very-soon/\">Gurman: New MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Mini Models With M4 Chips Launching 'Very Soon'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-new-macbook-pro-imac-and-mac-mini-models-with-m4-chips-launching-very-soon.2440689/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e7d344b2638f4e9ae911b225194db7df266d01737b54e5251647db65b3f9ca0e","category":"Apple"}
