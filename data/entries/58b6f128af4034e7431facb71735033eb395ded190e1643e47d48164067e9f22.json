But if you have an entry-level M3 MacBook Pro, there’s another reason for installing the update right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/109035\">Sonoma 14.6</a> includes the ability for the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro to run two external displays up to 5K at 60Hz (for example, two <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">Apple Studio Displays</a>)–the same ability that was<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2258183/how-to-run-dual-external-displays-m3-macbook-air-pro.html\"> previously made available for the M3 MacBook Air</a>. Before the update, non-Pro/Max MacBook Pro models could run only one external display, though Apple promised support in March. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the two display support does come with a compromise. The MacBook Pro has to be in what is often called “clamshell” mode with the lid closed to power both displays. When the MacBook Pro is opened, one of the displays gets disconnected when the laptop display turns on. The external displays also must support a video connection over USB-C or Thunderbolt 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2370203/macos-sonoma-14-6-features-security-fixes-install-html.html\">macOS Sonoma 14.6</a>, and get more information in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS Sonoma Superguide</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"58b6f128af4034e7431facb71735033eb395ded190e1643e47d48164067e9f22","category":"Apple"}
