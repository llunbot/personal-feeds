She is as core to the history of Google as anyone, and it’s hard to imagine the world without her. She was an incredible person, leader and friend who had a tremendous impact on the world and I’m one of countless Googlers who is better for knowing her. We will miss her dearly. Our thoughts with her family. RIP Susan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/10/susan-wojcicki-rip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ccfff717d7709a9e60d91d002d4fdccbd2d94c26a85e2fb730f882a5666047ac","category":"Tech"}
