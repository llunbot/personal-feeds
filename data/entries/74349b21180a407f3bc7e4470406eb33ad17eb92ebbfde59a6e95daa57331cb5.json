Only a small percentage of those players have been able to survive Tyson's flurry of instant-knockdown uppercuts and emerge victorious with the undisputed World Video Boxing Association championship. <a href=\"https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/525246-mike-tysons-punch-out/53884982\">Even fewer</a> have had fast enough fingers to <a href=\"https://www.showbizpizza.com/tomspunchout/strat-tyson.html\">take out Tyson in the first round</a>.</p>\n<p>In all that time, no one has been able to register a TKO on Tyson in less than two minutes on the ever-present in-game clock (which runs roughly three times as quickly as a real-time clock). At least, that was true until this weekend, when popular speedrunner and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/SummoningSalt\">speedrun historian</a> Summoning Salt <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2376320266\">pulled off a 1:59.97 knockout</a> after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpCXiO7eRyw\">what he says</a> was \"75,000 attempts over nearly 5 years.\"</p>\n<div><div></div><div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      Summoning Salt's record-setting sub-2:00 run\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2>Incredibly good and incredibly lucky</h2>\n<p>Breaking the storied 2:00 barrier on Tyson is a matter of both incredible skill and incredibly unlikely luck. As Summoning Salt himself <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt1DFNSNbRk\">started documenting in a 2017 video</a>, getting the quickest possible Tyson TKO requires throwing 21 \"frame perfect\" punches throughout the fight, each within a 1/60th of a second window. Too early, and those punches do slightly less damage, making the fight take just a bit longer. Too late, and Tyson will throw up a block, negating the punch entirely.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/punch-outs-mike-tyson-has-been-defeated-in-under-two-minutes-for-the-first-time/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/punch-outs-mike-tyson-has-been-defeated-in-under-two-minutes-for-the-first-time/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"74349b21180a407f3bc7e4470406eb33ad17eb92ebbfde59a6e95daa57331cb5","category":"Tech"}
