We don’t know about you, but that smells like Black Friday is knocking on the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cool new iPad Mini features the A17 Pro chip, which means it supports <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a>. Since we’re currently reviewing the iPad Mini, we can share that we already love this compatibility, as well as the speed boost delivered by the new chip. The 8.3-inch Liquid Retina Display is gorgeous as well, with great color and deep contrast. We also love to see that the base model comes with 128GB, which is double what the previous version had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2504744/ipad-mini-a17-pro-review.html\">4-star review</a>, we praised the speed and size of the iPad mini and its support for Apple Intelligence. We concluded that “The iPad mini is still a great tablet, perhaps the best at its size.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also on sale is the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2326113/apple-pencil-pro-m4-m2-ipad-air-pro-features-price-compatibility.html\">Apple Pencil Pro</a>, which is compatible with the new iPad mini. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-Pro-Pixel-Perfect-Industry-Leading/dp/B0D3J71RM7\">Amazon is selling it for $92</a>, a savings of $37. It brings several writing and drawing features to the iPad mini, including squeeze and haptic controls, and pixel-perfect precision, tilt, and pressure sensitivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So take advantage of this super early Black Friday deal and snatch the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3W4YHS/?th=1\">iPad Mini for $400 at Amazon</a> while you still can.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get the new iPad Mini for $90 off</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3W4YHS/?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"41b47643d3447ea48cb475bd99aa70d22766efa10328ce0cdc59d39a032d4276","category":"Apple"}
