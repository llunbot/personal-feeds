{"title":"From birth to gene-edited in 6 months: Custom therapy breaks speed limits","link":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/the-remarkable-timeline-of-a-custom-gene-editing-therapy-to-save-a-newborn/","date":1747418423000,"content":"<p>News broke yesterday that researchers in Philadelphia <a href=\"https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2025/may/worlds-first-patient-treated-with-personalized-crispr-therapy\">appear to have successfully treated a 6-month-old baby boy</a>, called KJ, with a personalized CRISPR gene-editing therapy. The treatment corrects an ultra-rare mutation in KJ that breaks a liver enzyme. That enzyme is required to convert ammonia, a byproduct of metabolism, to urea, a waste product released in urine. Without treatment, ammonia would build up to dangerous levels in KJ—and he would have a 50 percent chance of dying in infancy.</p>\n<p>While the gene-editing treatment isn't a complete cure, and long-term success is still uncertain, KJ's condition has improved and stabilized. And the treatment's positive results appear to be a first for personalizing gene editing.</p>\n<p>Now, who doesn't love a good story about a seemingly miraculous medical treatment saving a cute, chubby-cheeked baby? But, this story delivers more than an adorable bundle of joy; the big triumph is the striking timeline of the treatment's development—and the fact that it provides a template for how to treat other babies with ultra-rare mutations.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/the-remarkable-timeline-of-a-custom-gene-editing-therapy-to-save-a-newborn/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/the-remarkable-timeline-of-a-custom-gene-editing-therapy-to-save-a-newborn/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b01f48ea8b20eba2e3aa974411d64109e961b515d8a281f5efe19b8797e1f8e6","category":"Tech"}
