New Windows Insider builds <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/02/08/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26052-canary-and-dev-channels/\">released to the Canary and Dev channels</a> both roll their version numbers to \"24H2,\" indicating that they're the earliest builds of what Microsoft will eventually release to all Windows users sometime this fall.</p>\n<p>New features in 24H2 include a smattering of things Microsoft has already been testing in public since the big batch of new features that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/next-major-windows-update-is-available-september-26th-with-new-ai-and-not-ai-features/\">dropped last September</a>, plus a handful of new things. The biggest new one is the addition of <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-sudo-for-windows/\">Sudo for Windows</a>, a version of a Linux/Unix terminal command that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/windows-version-of-the-venerable-linux-sudo-command-shows-up-in-preview-build/\">first broke cover</a> in a preview build earlier this month. The new build also includes better support for hearing aids, support for creating 7-zip and TAR archives in File Explorer, an energy-saving mode, and new changes to the SMB protocol. This build also removes both the WordPad and the Tips apps.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these features may be released to all Windows 11 users before the end of the year. During the Windows 11 era, it's been Microsoft's practice to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/microsoft-commits-to-updating-windows-11-once-per-year-and-also-all-the-time/#:~:text=Microsoft%20commits%20to%20updating%20Windows,all%20the%20time%20%7C%20Ars%20Technica\">drop new features in several small batches</a> throughout the year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002742#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002742&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"10648fa5f2afa1d2536d605ac98482c3824db0f39f82fa5e37563ea288199f2a","category":"Tech"}
