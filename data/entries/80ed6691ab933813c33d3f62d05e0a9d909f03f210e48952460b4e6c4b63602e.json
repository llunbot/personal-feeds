This is a design quirk that’s been the subject of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/626532/magic-mouse-charging-upside-down-why.html\">considerable speculation</a> over the years.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iMac-M4-yellow-Magic-accessories.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Yellow iMac M4 Magic accessories\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iMac-M4-yellow-Magic-accessories.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3365w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iMac-M4-yellow-Magic-accessories.jpg?resize=300%2C144&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iMac-M4-yellow-Magic-accessories.jpg?resize=768%2C369&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iMac-M4-yellow-Magic-accessories.jpg?resize=1200%2C576&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iMac-M4-yellow-Magic-accessories.jpg?resize=1536%2C737&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iMac-M4-yellow-Magic-accessories.jpg?resize=2048%2C983&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As noted above, the three accessories are each available in either black or white on Apple’s storefront, with the black version costing $20 more. As with the M1 and M3 iMac models, however, Apple has made them in other colors too; they’re just not available on their own. If you place a pre-order for the new M4 iMac, it comes with a bundled Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse in the same color (blue, purple, pink, orange, yellow, green, or silver), and you can choose to upgrade the latter with a Magic Trackpad by paying an extra $50. At some point, Apple may sell these more vibrant accessories on their own (though after three years it’s unlikely), but for now, you’ll have to save up for a whole new iMac if you want them that badly.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"80ed6691ab933813c33d3f62d05e0a9d909f03f210e48952460b4e6c4b63602e","category":"Apple"}
