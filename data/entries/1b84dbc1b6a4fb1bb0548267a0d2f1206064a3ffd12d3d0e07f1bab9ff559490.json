However, Agus later implied that the company's proposal was not yet adequate. \"If it is $1 billion, then that is not enough,\" he told reporters after the meeting.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast year, Indonesian authorities <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/indonesia-bans-iphone-16-sales/\">banned</a> iPhone 16 sales after they determined Apple had failed to meet the country's requirement for 35% domestic content in smartphones. Apple has since offered a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/03/apple-raises-indonesia-investment-offer-iphone-ban/\">$1 billion</a> investment in the country that includes building an AirTag factory. Apple's offer is a significant increase from its previous offers of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/indonesia-iphone-ban-apple-10m-investment/\">$10 million</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-ups-invest-offer-indonesia-iphone-16-ban/\">$100 million</a>, which were rejected by the government.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAgus confirmed Apple had agreed to build a facility producing AirTag tracking devices on Indonesia's Batam island, close to Singapore, but that still would not count as a locally-made iPhone part.\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"There is no basis for the ministry to issue a local content certification as a way for Apple to have the permission to sell iPhone 16 because (the facility) has no direct relations,\" he said, adding the ministry would only count phone components.</blockquote>Indonesia's investment minister on Tuesday said the factory would start operations next year. The agreement will be seen as a success for President Prabowo's efforts to attract foreign investment while demonstrating the effectiveness of Indonesia's strategy to pressure international companies into developing products locally. The country remains a significant market for Apple, with over half of its 278 million residents under the age of 44.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/indonesia/\">Indonesia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/08/iphone-16-still-banned-indonesia-1b-deal/\">iPhone 16 Still Banned in Indonesia Despite $1B Apple Investment Deal</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-still-banned-in-indonesia-despite-1b-apple-investment-deal.2446961/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1b84dbc1b6a4fb1bb0548267a0d2f1206064a3ffd12d3d0e07f1bab9ff559490","category":"Apple"}
