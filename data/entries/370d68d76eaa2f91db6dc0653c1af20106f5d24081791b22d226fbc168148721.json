Apple has just released iOS 14.8.1 and iPadOS 14.8.1, which include important security updates in several key components of the OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212868&amp;xcust=1-1-547549-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple’s security page</a> has detailed information on the security flaws addressed, but the gist of it is this: There are quite a few components of iOS that have vulnerabilities that, when exploited, could allow for arbitrary code execution. Sometimes with kernel privileges. In one case, Apple notes that it is “aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, Apple has fixed several <em>very serious</em> security flaws that could let hackers <em>really</em> mess with you and your data. And hackers have already probably exploited one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get iOS 14.8.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To update your iPhone, open Settings, then tap on General, then Software Update. If you’re still on iOS 14, you’ll see the option to update to 14.8.1. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also see the option to update to iOS 15 (but you aren’t required to update). The latest version, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/358512/ios-15-1-features-shareplay-release-date-how-to-install.html\">iOS 15.1</a>, includes these same security fixes.</p>\n</div>","author":"Jason Cross","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"370d68d76eaa2f91db6dc0653c1af20106f5d24081791b22d226fbc168148721","category":"Apple"}
