This cache is layered over top of the existing CPU silicon, earning it the name \"3D V-Cache,\" and it has proven especially successful for accelerating cache-sensitive software like games.</p>\n<p>Today, AMD is announcing the first 3D V-Cache processor for laptops, the Ryzen 9 7945X3D. It's a version of the regular 16-core Ryzen 9 7945HX with that same 64MB chunk of cache added in, giving it a total of 144MB of L3 cache.</p>\n<p>The 7945HX is essentially a version of the desktop Ryzen 9 7950X repackaged for use in laptops instead of high-end desktops; while chips like the similarly named 7940HS use one monolithic silicon die for everything from the CPU cores to the chipset to the integrated GPU, the 7950HX uses a pair of 8-core CPU chiplets and a separate I/O die.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957094#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957094&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f6540f3915b9c8a58a17a7a7713fe611982594bdb900b16f46973b07818bb14c","category":"Tech"}
