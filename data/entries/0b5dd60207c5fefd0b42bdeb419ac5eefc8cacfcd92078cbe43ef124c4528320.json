We're seeing that situation play out again today, this time thanks to how some DRM systems interact with the unique features of Intel's 12th-generation \"Alder Lake\" CPUs.</p>\n<p>We've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/intels-alder-lake-big-little-cpu-design-tested-its-a-barn-burner/\">already covered</a> how Alder Lake's hybrid \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_big.LITTLE\">big.little</a>\" design splits the CPU's workload into high-powered \"performance\" (P) cores and low-powered \"efficiency\" (E) cores. But after hinting at the potential issue <a href=\"https://gamersgospel.com/denuvo-and-other-drm-might-have-issues-on-intels-new-cpus/\">in a developer FAQ last month</a>, Intel is now confirming that <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088261/processors.html\">some games</a> contain DRM <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088259/processors/intel-core-processors.html\">that Intel says</a> \"may incorrectly recognize 12th Generation Intel Core Processors efficient-cores (E-cores) as another system.\" That issue can lead to games that \"may crash during launch or gameplay or unexpectedly shut down,\" Intel says.</p>\n<p>PC Mag's Chris Stobing <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/intel-these-50-plus-pc-games-are-incompatible-with-alder-lake-cpus-due\">explained</a> that the issue arises from the DRM middleware treating the two different types of cores as two distinct systems. \"Once it detects that some portion of the load has been split between the P- and E-cores, it sees the new cores as a new license holder (a separate system) and force-quits the game to prevent what it believes is two PCs trying to play one game on the same key,” he said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810871#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810871&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0b5dd60207c5fefd0b42bdeb419ac5eefc8cacfcd92078cbe43ef124c4528320","category":"Tech"}
