The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus models will be discounted by 400 yuan, while <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> models will receive markdowns of up to 300 yuan. Other products, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, Apple Watch, AirPods, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, will also see price reductions, with the ‌MacBook Air‌ eligible for a discount of up to 800 yuan. The promotional items are available in limited quantities, with only 29,300 iPhones included in the sale. The promotion is tied to specific payment methods, such as WeChat Pay and Alipay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple rarely offers direct discounts on its latest products, particularly its flagship ‌iPhone‌ models. Such promotions are usually handled by third-party retailers in China, especially during major shopping events like Singles Day, when platforms like Alibaba's Tmall and Pinduoduo slash prices to drive sales. For instance, during the last Singles Day shopping festival in November, ‌iPhone 16‌ models were discounted by as much as 1,600 yuan on Tmall. The timing of the latest promotion comes as Apple faces heightened competition from Huawei and other Chinese brands, although the company did offer a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/apple-offers-rare-iphone-discounts-china/\">similar promotion last year</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/02/apple-discounts-products-in-china/\">Apple Discounts Products in China Amid Fierce Competition</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discounts-products-in-china-amid-fierce-competition.2446576/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"262466f249f15fd7db31f4eab1dedc690ebd1b9ad21c804fe4942a5de5800409","category":"Apple"}
