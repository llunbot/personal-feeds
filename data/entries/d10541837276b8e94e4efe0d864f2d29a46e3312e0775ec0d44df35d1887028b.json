However, unlike the Madone, Pilot says the seat mast is not for compliance.

The Seiren is scheduled to enter full production in October and go on sale in early 2024.</p>\n<p>Size-54cm and 56cm frames will be available at launch. Pilot will then move into designing smaller frames, but says frames larger than 56cm present a challenge – not due to their design, but the size of the 3D-printed beds currently available to a firm of Pilot’s size.</p>\n<p>Pricing is slated to be around €17,000 for a build similar to the one pictured.</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"d10541837276b8e94e4efe0d864f2d29a46e3312e0775ec0d44df35d1887028b","category":"Cycling"}
