It’s a relatively short travel bike at just 160mm in the rear. But the high-pivot suspension design seemed to do the trick for the young rider from Canada, keeping the tires stuck to the rocks and slippery roots for a very wet day of enduro racing!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Elly Hoskins’ carbon Devinci Spartan HP enduro race bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_angled-front.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_angled-front.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Spartan HP Carbon high-pivot enduro mountain bike of 2025 Bielsko-Biała UCI World Cup EDR winner Elly Hoskins, post-race\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_angled-front.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_angled-front-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_angled-front-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_angled-front-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_angled-front-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(All photos/Cory Benson)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Devinci Spartan HP enduro has been around for quite some time. We <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/devincis-new-spartan-hp-enduro-bike-adopts-high-pivot-suspension-for-2022/\" target=\"_blank\">first wrote about it</a> when Devinci moved it to a high single-pivot suspension design with an idler pulley three and half years ago. It’s also a rare carbon model in their line-up these days, from the Quebec bike maker that prides itself on its made-in-Canada aluminum mountain bike frames. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the 3rd season for the 21-year-old <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/elly.hoskin/\" target=\"_blank\">Hoskins</a> racing on the Spartan, and Devinci just got her the new 2025 Black Dust colorway. You just can’t really see it under all of that mud.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_lucky-number-7.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_lucky-number-7.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Spartan HP Carbon high-pivot enduro mountain bike of 2025 Bielsko-Biała UCI World Cup EDR winner Elly Hoskins, lucky number 7\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_lucky-number-7.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_lucky-number-7-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_lucky-number-7-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_lucky-number-7-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_lucky-number-7-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Devinci-Spartan-HP-Carbon-high-pivot-enduro-mountain-bike-of-2025-Bielsko-Biala-UCI-World-Cup-EDR-winner-Elly-Hoskins_lucky-number-7-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also only the second race for Hoskins as an Elite rider, and already she’s come away with a big World Cup win in Bielsko-Biała, Poland. And it was decisive, with more than 45 seconds over the second-place finisher, then another 6 seconds back for third-place. For comparison, there were 11 Elite Men who finished within 45 seconds of that race’s winner Sławomir Łukasik, and just 8 seconds separating the men’s podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 Devinci Spartan HP

pedalling forces, while providing excellent small-bump compliance alongside solid pedalling efficiency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re pretty sure Hoskins was running her size Small bike in its High flip-chip position (although with so much mud, we’re not 100% sure) which would give it a 65° head angle, a 77.7° seattube, lengthens Reach to 450mm, and shortens its chainstays to just 421mm for the full 29er.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bike Build</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
