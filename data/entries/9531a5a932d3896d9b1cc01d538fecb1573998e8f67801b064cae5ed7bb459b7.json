{"title":"ISP failed to comply with New York’s $15 broadband law—until Ars got involved","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/isp-failed-to-comply-with-new-yorks-15-broadband-law-until-ars-got-involved/","date":1737736953000,"content":"<p>When New York's law requiring $15 or $20 broadband plans for people with low incomes took effect last week, Optimum customer William O'Brien tried to sign up for the cheap Internet service. Since O'Brien is in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), he qualifies for one of the affordable plans that Internet service providers must offer New Yorkers who meet income eligibility requirements.</p>\n<p>O'Brien has been paying Optimum $111.20 a month for broadband—$89.99 for the broadband service, $14 in equipment rental fees, a $6 \"Network Enhancement Fee,\" and $1.21 in tax. He was due for a big discount under the <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/GBS/399-ZZZZZ\">New York Affordable Broadband Act (ABA)</a>, which says that any ISP with over 20,000 customers must offer either a $15 plan with download speeds of at least 25Mbps or a $20 plan with at least 200Mbps speeds, and that the price must include \"any recurring taxes and fees such as recurring rental fees for service provider equipment required to obtain broadband service and usage fees.\"</p>\n<p>Despite qualifying for a low-income plan under the law's criteria, O'Brien's request was denied by Optimum. He reached out to Ars, just like many other people who have read our articles about bad telecom customer service. Usually, these problems are fixed quickly after we reach out to an Internet provider's public relations department on the customer's behalf.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/isp-failed-to-comply-with-new-yorks-15-broadband-law-until-ars-got-involved/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/isp-failed-to-comply-with-new-yorks-15-broadband-law-until-ars-got-involved/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9531a5a932d3896d9b1cc01d538fecb1573998e8f67801b064cae5ed7bb459b7","category":"Tech"}
