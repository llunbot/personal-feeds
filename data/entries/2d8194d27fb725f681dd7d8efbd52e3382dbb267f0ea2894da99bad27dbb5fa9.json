Keep reading to learn whether you should install it on your Mac, and if so, how to go about it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-hero-240610.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nSigning up to get the macOS Sequoia beta is simple, and can be done by enrolling a Mac in Apple's free Apple Beta Software Program. The steps you need to complete to install the software on your device are provided towards the end of this article, but before you jump ahead, here are a few things worth considering.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Should I Install macOS Sequoia Public Beta?</h2>\r<br />\nBefore downloading the update, it's worth noting that Apple does not recommend installing the macOS Sequoia Beta on your main Mac, so if you have a secondary Mac that has no important data on it, use that. This is beta software, which means there are often bugs and issues that pop up that can prevent software from working properly or cause other problems. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith that caveat in mind, the steps in the remainder of this article show you how to get the macOS 15 beta on your Mac. First though, check that you have a compatible Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Will macOS Sequoia run on My Mac?</h2>\r<br />\nmacOS 15 Sequoia works with the same Macs as macOS 14 Sonoma other than the 2018 and 2019 MacBook Air. They include:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n    <li>MacBook Air (2020 and later)</li>\r<br />\n    <li>MacBook Pro (2018 and later)</li>\r<br />\n    <li>iMac (2019 and later)</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Mac Mini (2018 and later)</li>\r<br />\n    <li>iMac Pro (2017 and later)</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Mac Pro (2019 and later)</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Mac Studio (2022 and later)</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nYou can check your Mac's model by clicking the Apple in the menu bar and choosing About This Mac. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Don't Forget to Back Up Your Mac</h2>\r<br />\nBe sure to back up your Mac using Time Machine before installing the software using the method, otherwise you won't be able to revert back to the previous version of macOS if things go wrong.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>How to Download macOS Sequoia Public Beta</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/apple-beta-software-program.jpg\" width=\"2774\" height=\"1494\" /><ol>\r<br />\n \t<li>On your Mac, open up Safari and navigate to the <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\">Apple Beta Software Program website</a>.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Tap the <strong>Sign up</strong> button and enter your Apple ID credentials, or sign in with your Apple ID if you've signed up to beta test a previous update.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Agree to the Apple Beta Software Program terms and conditions if required.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>After signing in, you'll see a main screen that's a Guide for Public Betas.

Then follow the onscreen instructions to complete installation.
