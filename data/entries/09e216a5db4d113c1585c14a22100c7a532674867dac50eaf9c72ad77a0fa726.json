Instead, passes can be purchased directly in the Wallet app on the iPhone, or in the Île-de-France Mobilités app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also announced that real-time transit information for the Paris area will be available in Apple Maps starting this week. This feature will allow riders to view detailed schedules, live departure and arrival times, delays, outages, and any connections required to complete a trip across multiple transit systems.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn related news, it was recently <a href=\"https://x.com/PRESTOcard/status/1791248521334546928\">announced</a> that the PRESTO transit card in the Toronto, Canada area will soon support the Wallet app too.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Apple-Wallet-PRESTO-Transit-Card-Toronto.jpeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"574\" />\r<br />\nIn both cities, the transit cards will support Express Mode, meaning that riders can simply hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near a payment reader to pay for their ride, without needing to unlock or wake the device. Express Mode continues to work for up to five hours after an iPhone has run out of battery power.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Thanks, <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@apollozhao\">Apollo Zhao</a>!</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/apple-wallet-app-transit-cards-paris-toronto/\">Apple Wallet App Gaining Support for Transit Cards in Paris and Toronto</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wallet-app-gaining-support-for-transit-cards-in-paris-and-toronto.2427030/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"09e216a5db4d113c1585c14a22100c7a532674867dac50eaf9c72ad77a0fa726","category":"Apple"}
