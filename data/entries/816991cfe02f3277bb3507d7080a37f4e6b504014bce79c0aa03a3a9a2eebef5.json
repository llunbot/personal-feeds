The source was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/\">first to report</a> the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>'s Yellow spring refresh, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/\">Spatial Video</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/apple-watch-series-9-basically-unchanged/\">minor refresh</a>, as well as the only rumor claiming that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus would feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/\">frosted back glass</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's plan to bring a microLED display to the Apple Watch Ultra is very widely corroborated, starting with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/microled-apple-watch-2025/\">report</a> from display analyst Ross Young in January. TrendForce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/04/apple-watch-ultra-microled-delayed-early-2026/\">claims</a> that Apple's first microLED display will launch on a new Apple Watch Ultra model in 2026, due to supply chain adjustments, but some earlier reports placed the device's launch in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/27/apple-watch-ultra-second-half-2025/\">2025</a>. The microLED display is expected to be 2.12-inches in size, a 10% increase over the display of the current Apple Watch Ultra.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/15/apple-custom-displays-heading-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-after-apple-watch/\">reported</a> Apple is likely planning to bring custom microLED displays to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and Mac after the technology debuts in a new version of the Apple Watch Ultra. He believes Apple's long-term plan is to bring microLED displays to all of its key products. Other reports from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/10/microled-iphone-report/\"><em>DigiTimes</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/apple-mass-produce-microled-iphone/\"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/\"><em>The Information</em></a> have indicated similar plans for Apple to transition to custom microLED displays across multiple product lines in an effort to become less <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/\">reliant on Samsung</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is believed to have spent more than six years developing microLED technology for what will become the first display custom-designed by the company itself, mirroring its work on Apple silicon. Apple reportedly kicked off the current form of its microLED project, codenamed T159, around 2017. At an earlier stage, it even wanted to introduce the technology <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/\">with the iPhone X</a>. The advanced display offers improved brightness, color reproduction, and viewing angles, making images look more like they are \"painted\" atop the display glass, and replace parts currently supplied by companies like Samsung and LG.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/micro-led/\">Micro-LED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setsuna-digital/\">Setsuna Digital</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/\">microLED Apple Watch</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/next-major-apple-watch-upgrade-to-be-microled/\">Next Major Apple Watch Ultra Upgrade Rumored to Be MicroLED Display Technology</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-major-apple-watch-ultra-upgrade-rumored-to-be-microled-display-technology.2405936/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"816991cfe02f3277bb3507d7080a37f4e6b504014bce79c0aa03a3a9a2eebef5","category":"Apple"}
