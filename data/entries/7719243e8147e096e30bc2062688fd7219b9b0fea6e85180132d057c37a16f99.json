The wheelset has a claimed weight of 1,480g, over 100g lighter than its predecessor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Shamal – Dual Profile wheelset is priced at £1,649.99 / €1,890 with a N3W freehub and €1,897 with an HG11 or XDR freehub.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Trickle-down tech</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"649\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-antUN4-2025-970x649.jpg\" alt=\"Campagnolo Shamal Dual Profile wheels 2025\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-antUN4-2025-970x649.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-antUN4-2025-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-antUN4-2025-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-antUN4-2025-1536x1027.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-antUN4-2025-2048x1369.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-antUN4-2025-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-antUN4-2025-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-antUN4-2025-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-antUN4-2025-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Campagnolo </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo says that the new wheelset offers versatility and attractive value for money, while using technology from its higher spec models such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/campagnolos-bora-ultra-wto-wheels-news\" target=\"_blank\">Bora WTO Ultra</a> pro-level wheels, although at over £1,500 it’s hardly a budget option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original Shamal wheelset was introduced back in 1992 and it has been a feature of the range ever since. It was a predecessor of today’s modern deeper section wheelsets and it became a favoured wheel for both <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/miguel-indurain-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Miguel Induráin </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pantani-tour-giro-double\" target=\"_blank\">Marco Pantani</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the patented G3 clustered lacing, another long-running Campagnolo technology that’s carried over is the 2-Way Fit rim bed, which eliminates the need for rim tape and allows tyre setup either with tubes or tubeless. Campagnolo has continued to provide hooked beads, rather than moving to a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\" target=\"_blank\">hookless rim</a> design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-rim-width\" target=\"_blank\">rim internal width </a>has increased and is now 23mm, the same as in the Bora Ultra wheels. It’s following the modern trend to increasingly <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-wider-tyres-faster\" target=\"_blank\">wider tyres</a> on road bikes and allowing the Shamal – Dual Profile wheels to be used with<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-cycling-tyres\" target=\"_blank\"> road bike tyres </a>of 28mm in width or more, as well as <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-gravel-bike-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bike tyres</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+8\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-8-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-posttHUB-2025-970x970.jpg\" alt=\"Campagnolo Shamal Dual Profile wheels 2025\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-posttHUB-2025-970x970.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-posttHUB-2025-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-posttHUB-2025-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-posttHUB-2025-768x768.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-posttHUB-2025-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-posttHUB-2025-75x75.jpg 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-posttHUB-2025-350x350.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-posttHUB-2025-750x750.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-posttHUB-2025-1140x1140.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/SHAMAL-DUAL-PROFILE-DB-2WF-C23-posttHUB-2025.jpg 1711w\" /><figcaption>Campagnolo </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hubs are alloy and fitted with cup and cone bearings rather than sealed bearings, so that they can be serviced as needed. Their differential profile has deeper flanges on the right side of the rear wheel and on the left side of the front wheel, which Campagnolo says helps to even out the forces acting on each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo says that, along with improved aerodynamics, the dual profile rim design improves wheel stiffness due to shorter spokes, while still providing a comfortable ride. It uses a unidirectional carbon fibre layup, which the brand says helps provide even load distribution through the wheel and the same C-Lux lacquer finish as on its premium wheelsets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-wheel-tech\" target=\"_blank\">Wavy rims </a>are proving increasingly popular, with examples available from Zipp, Princeton Carbonworks and most recently from Campagnolo subsidiary Fulcrum with its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fulcrum-sharq-allroad-wheelset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Sharq </a>all-road wheelset. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/dimitris-katsanis-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 111: Dimitris Katsanis makes the world’s fastest bikes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fulcrum-sharq-allroad-wheelset-review\">Fulcrum Sharq allroad wheelset review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\">Hooked vs hookless rims: Pros, cons and which is right for you</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/zipp-858-nsw-review\">Zipp 858 NSW wheelset review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Zipp, Fulcrum and Princeton all claim that the rims offer both the aero benefits of a deeper section wheel and the crosswind stability of a shallower section. Princeton also says it brings a wider bracing angle, adding rigidity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New wheelset launches are usually accompanied in white papers citing the aero gains, watt savings and other benefits on offer. However Campagnolo hasn’t provided any detailed analysis of the new Shamal’s performance so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/campagnolo-shamal-wheels-2025\">Campagnolo brings a wavy rim to its updated Shamal wheelset</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"7719243e8147e096e30bc2062688fd7219b9b0fea6e85180132d057c37a16f99","category":"Cycling"}
