{"title":"Apple Vision Pro and Cycling: Indoors & Outdoors Tested!","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/02/apple-vision-pro-cycling-zwift-outdoors-rouvy.html","date":1707769643000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>For those curious about whether or not Apple’s Vision Pro works well in cycling, I dig into all the questions you may or may not have had. Both from an outdoor standpoint, but also an indoor riding perspective on apps including Zwift and Rouvy.</p>\n<p>As you might expect, the outdoor portion, while entertaining no doubt, isn’t where the near-term future is for something like Vision Pro. Instead, it’s potentially the indoor side, as apps increase compatibility. With many of them already compatible, the leap isn’t too far. Add to that, aspects like the Meta Quest 3 already being heavily promoted for sport/fitness, the future might be closer than one thinks.</p>\n<p>In the video, I dig into all sorts of areas including comfort, heat, sweat handling, image clarity, and plenty more. I might write-up something a bit more detailed down the road (text vs video), but for now the above is fast-paced enough that should be entertaining for most cyclists, while still having just enough technical depth to answer pretty much any question anyone in the indoor cycling (or outdoor riding) realm might have.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"4d4021a04736be4d6c9b910aec435238ebf7b80ae1be60c0f8d9998c578c7e8a","category":"Cycling"}
