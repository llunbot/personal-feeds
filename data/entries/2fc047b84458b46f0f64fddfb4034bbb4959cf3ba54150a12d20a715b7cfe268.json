There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope.

The photographer told me they are no great astrophotographer, but that the skies were so dark and brilliant that even this single exposure photo taken with a Fuji X100 APS camera looks stunning.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992504#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992504&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2fc047b84458b46f0f64fddfb4034bbb4959cf3ba54150a12d20a715b7cfe268","category":"Tech"}
