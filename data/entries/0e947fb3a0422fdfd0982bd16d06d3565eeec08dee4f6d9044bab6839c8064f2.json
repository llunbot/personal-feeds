This morning, Redwood announced that it is working with Ultium Cells, the joint venture between GM and LG Energy Solutions that makes Ultium battery cells. Approximately 10,000 tons a year of production scrap will be sent from the Ultium Cells plants in Ohio and Tennessee to Redwood's site in northern Nevada.</p>\n<p>Redwood was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/09/former-tesla-cto-wins-amazon-funding-for-battery-recycling-project/\">started by</a> former Tesla CTO JB Straubel in 2017 and in recent years has announced partnerships with multiple OEMs, including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/ford-volvo-and-redwood-materials-start-recycling-ev-batteries/\">Ford, Volvo</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/volkswagen-partners-with-redwood-materials-to-recycle-ev-batteries/\">Volkswagen</a>, and now General Motors. Last year, the US Department of Energy <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/redwood-gets-2-billion-commitment-from-doe-for-recycled-batteries/\">approved a $2 billion loan</a> to Redwood as part of its Advanced Technology Manufacturing program (which also funded Ultium Cells).</p>\n<p>Redwood says that its hydrometallurgy facility is now a \"commercial-scale source of lithium supply,\" the first to come online in the United States for decades. The facility also produces raw nickel and cobalt from battery scrap.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026304#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026304&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
