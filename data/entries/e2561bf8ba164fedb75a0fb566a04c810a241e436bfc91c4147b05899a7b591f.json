{"title":"Four Useful VSCode Extensions For Web Developers","link":"https://smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/useful-vscode-extensions-web-developers/","date":1628244000000,"content":"<p>Which <code>param</code> is the array and which is the callback in PHP functions <code>array_map</code> and <code>array_filter</code>? I can never get it right. To avoid this confusion we can use <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liamhammett.inline-parameters\">Inline Parameters</a>, which prints inline the names of the function parameters (for JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Lua).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c82dbb79-64df-4f04-85db-1a225a08f882/1-useful-vscode-extensions-web-developers.png\" /></p>\n<p>With deeply nested <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags we can easily get lost, not knowing which is their ending <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code>. <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anteprimorac.html-end-tag-labels\">HTML End Tag Labels</a> helps us understand the structure of the HTML code, by having the class names of the opening tag be displayed next to its closing tag.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ba35f5bf-791f-4e4f-91a9-82af4d3aeae3/2-useful-vscode-extensions-web-developers.png\" /></p>\n<p>You have something to do in your code, but you don't have time for it now. Better do it later. Quick and easy reminder: add a \"TODO\" in your code. Fast forward 6 months, and you've accumulated 150 TODOs, and you need to take care of them. The <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree\">Todo Tree</a> will help you find all TODOs in your code.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2f984846-0510-48f5-a415-326027d14a88/3-useful-vscode-extensions-web-developers.png\" /></p>\n<p>You created some really beautiful code, and you want to share it with the world? You can take a screenshot, download it, go to Twitter, upload it and send it. Or you can select the code right within the editor, and have <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JeffersonLicet.snipped\">Snipped</a> generate a beautiful image of it and send it straight to Twitter.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bdda62e5-fe54-44eb-903b-c1c6771f34b1/4-useful-vscode-extensions-web-developers.png\" /></p>\n<p>These four extensions have proven very handy for my work with web development. What other useful extensions do you use?
