There hasn’t been a new iPad released since 2022, and iPad sales are suffering for it, but the new models coming in May could actually bring some significant new changes and maybe even a surprise or two. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s really odd for Apple to release new hardware in May, much less hold an event for it, but that’s exactly what’s happening on <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2312605/surprise-apple-announces-let-loose-event-on-may-5.html\">May 7 with the “Let Loose” event</a>. That will make a pretty exciting lead-up to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC, which begins on June 10</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPads! Finally!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On May 7, Apple is holding an event with the tagline “Let Loose.” Given that one of the promotional images is an Apple logo with a hand holding an Apple Pencil, and the flood of rumors and leaks over the last few months, this is finally the release of some new iPads. Here’s what we expect:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPad Pro:</strong> New <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/2024-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models</a> that are a bit thinner and feature a new OLED display. It should have the front-facing camera on the long edge, so it’s properly positioned when the iPad is in landscape orientation. A new tip suggests that Apple might skip the M3 processor altogether and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2318178/shock-report-ipad-pro-m4-chip-not-m3.html\">introduce the M4 in this iPad</a>, much earlier than we expected!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPad Air:</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">new iPad Air</a> won’t have an OLED display or an M3 or M4 processor. Instead, it’s supposed to get a bump up to the M2. Rumors say the existing 11-inch model is going to be joined by a 12.9-inch one. Beyond the larger size and a step up in processing power, it should also get a landscape-oriented front camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Pencil:</strong> That’s right, Apple might release <em>yet another</em> new Apple Pencil to go along with the new iPads. The thinner iPad Pro and landscape-oriented cameras may necessitate a new third-generation design. The new Pencil may have a “squeeze” gesture along with haptic feedback. Apple already sells no less than three products all named “Apple Pencil” with different capabilities and compatibility, to the extent that there’s a <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2318413-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/\">chart on Apple’s website</a> to help you understand what’s different about them. We assume this new model will replace at least one of the current Pencils and maybe two of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Other accessories:</strong> The thinner iPad Pros may necessitate new Magic Keyboards, which rumors say will have a few design tweaks. There’s no telling what <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2311282/3-surprises-apple-let-loose-event.html\">other products Apple might introduce at the event</a>–new AirPods are expected this year, and we’ve heard of a new HomePod (perhaps one with a “dock” for the iPad?) for some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re currently deep into testing a new round of iOS and macOS betas that do little more than add more compliance with EU regulations and make a minor tweak to Find My’s anti-stalking feature for item trackers. We expect it will be released before the new iPads are available, as they will probably need iPadOS 17.5 to support the new hardware and accessories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 17.5:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2262753/ios-17-5-beta-is-now-available-with-app-downloads-from-websites-in-eu.html\">This release</a> enables app downloads directly from websites in the EU (with a heap of caveats), and updates the anti-stalking measures in Find My to work with third-party trackers and not just AirTags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPadOS 17.5:</strong> The chief improvement in iPadOS 17.5 is probably going to be support for the new iPads and their accessories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS 14.5:</strong> We haven’t seen any new features in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2285650/macos-14-5-beta-features-how-to-install.html\">macOS 14.5 beta</a>, just some bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in TK.
