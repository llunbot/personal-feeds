The new internal build number is 1A291e, up from 1A291c from the prior revision.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/AitTag-New-Firmware.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's no word on what's included in the new firmware and no new features were found following the first release, so it likely focuses on bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple does not provide an option to force an AirTag update, as it's something that's done over-the-air through a connected <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. To make sure the update happens, you can put your AirTag in range of your ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor AirTag firmware releases, Apple appears to have a system that limits the number of people who see the update with each deployment to meter the rollout of the software. Today's firmware update jumps to a 25 percent rollout level, up from 10 percent with the prior version of the firmware. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYou can check your current AirTag firmware version using the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> app, with instructions <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/check-airtags-firmware-version/\">available in our how to</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/apple-releases-revised-airtags-firmware-2/\">Apple Releases Another Revised Version of AirTags Firmware Update</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-another-revised-version-of-airtags-firmware-update.2309993/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=j_LCB8nnfGM:2DtKIVJdWds:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=j_LCB8nnfGM:2DtKIVJdWds:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/j_LCB8nnfGM\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9b998f064f8fc5e7eb7edcbba64a9c83beaf1185425d97273bfaebeede18076c","category":"Apple"}
