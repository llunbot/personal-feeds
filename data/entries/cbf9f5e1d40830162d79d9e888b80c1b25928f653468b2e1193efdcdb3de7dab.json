The first-generation AirPods are still on 6.8.8 and haven’t been updated since December 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Apple’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213317&amp;xcust=1-1-1784147-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">release notes</a>, the update, which follows several updates over the past week including <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1780577/ios-16-4-1-bug-fixes-security-updates.html\">iOS 16.4.1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1780591/macos-ventura-13-3-1-bug-fixes-security-updates.html\">macOS 13.3.1</a>, contains the standard “bug fixes and other improvements.” When Apple originally released the update on Tuesday, any attempt by the AirPods to install it returned an error. Apple quickly pulled the update and released a working version. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to update the AirPods firmware</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple installs AirPods firmware automatically while charging, so it’s possible the firmware is already installed. There is no way for the user to force the firmware update, so if it’s not installed, plug your AirPods into a charger with your iPhone nearby and wait for the new firmware to install. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Check the AirPods firmware version</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how you can see if the firmware is installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><div><div>At a glance </div></div><ul><li><span>Time to complete: </span><span>  2 minutes</span></li><li>Tools required: iOS 16</li><li>Materials required: AirPods</li></ul></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Bluetooth settings</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ios-16-bluetooth.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 16 Bluetooth settings\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Open the <em>Bluetooth</em> tab in the Settings app on your iPhone.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Select your AirPods</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ios-16-bluetooth-airpods-pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 16 Bluetooth AirPods listing\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Look for your AirPods in the <em>My Devices</em> section and tap the Info (i) icon.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>3.</span>\n<h3>Firmware version listing</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ios-16-airpods-pro-firmware-version.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 16 AirPods firmware version\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Scroll down to the <em>About</em> section.
