In 2023, Apple's MacBook and iPad shipments declined significantly by approximately 30% and 22% to 17 million and 48 million units, respectively. The sharp decline is attributed to the end of work-from-home (WFH) demand and diminishing user appeal for the new specifications (Apple Silicon and Mini-LED). Looking ahead to 2024, Apple's 3nm demand is negatively impacted by the lack of growth drivers for MacBook and iPad.</blockquote>Kuo is essentially saying that Apple will no longer have the growth catalysts that it did over the past few years, such as a pandemic-driven work-from-home boost in demand or the newness of Apple silicon, which spurred many customers to upgrade from Intel-based Macs. However, given Mac and iPad sales already significantly declined in 2023, Apple will at least have more favorable year-over-year sales comparisons in 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's also worth noting that the next iPad Pro models are expected to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/ipad-pro-oled-display-mass-production-early-2024/\">feature OLED displays</a>, which could be another growth driver for that product line.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo recently said that he <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/\">does not expect Apple to release any new MacBooks</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/\">iPads</a> between now and the end of 2023, although it was recently rumored that a new iPad mini is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/apple-ipad-mini-7-release-late-2023/\">still possible this year</a>. If Kuo is accurate, it is possible that Apple will wait until 2024 to announce the M3 chip, which could result in a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/what-to-expect-from-apple-remainder-of-2023/\">quiet end to this year</a> for the company.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/kuo-2024-macbooks-ipads-3nm/\">Kuo: 2024 MacBooks and iPads to Feature 3nm Chips, But Demand Might Fall Below Expectations</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-2024-macbooks-and-ipads-to-feature-3nm-chips-but-demand-might-fall-below-expectations.2405084/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d94ef68080be59bbe2f319fd5527700a6b0dd2ed5170fa60e62447dedfb42e4d","category":"Apple"}
