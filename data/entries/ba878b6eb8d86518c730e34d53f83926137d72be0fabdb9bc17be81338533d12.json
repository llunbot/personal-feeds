So, if you are in the UK and wanting to watch riders battle it out for the pink jersey, you'll have to view on either GCN+, Discovery+ or the Eurosport Player. All of them show coverage from the neutral zone to the finish line and include a discussion show before and after, and are available on a multitude of devices, meaning you can watch at home or on the go. </p>\n<p>The main difference between Discovery+ and Eurosport Player versus GCN+ is that subscription to the former two will include access to other live sports, whereas GCN+ will give you access to every cycling race it has rights for, as well as a host of documentaries and films exclusively available on the platform.</p>\n<p>Discovery+ and Eurosport Player cost £59.99 on an annual basis or £6.99 per month, and GCN+ costs £39.99 on an annual subscription or £6.99 per month. Top tip, If you are a Sky Q, Sky Stream, or Sky Glass customer in the UK, you now get Discovery+ as part of your TV package for no extra cost. </p>\n<p>If you are in Wales, S4C will be broadcasting the Giro live each day. However, if you wanting to watch every pedal stroke, be warned S4C will feature advertisements through the broadcast. </p>\n<h3>How to watch the Giro d'Italia in the USA and Canada </h3>\n<p>People wanting to watch this year's Giro from the USA or Canada will need to have access to a GCN+ account, where it will be broadcasting each stage live with no interruptions. This is the only platform so far for people living in the USA or Canada to watch the Italian Grand Tour. </p>\n<p>The cost of a monthly subscription to GCN+ for American customers is $8.99 a month. </p>\n<h3>How to watch the Giro d'Italia in Australia </h3>\n\n<p>For those living in Australia, the Giro d'Italia coverage is exclusively free-to-air, meaning everyone can watch the action from one of the world's biggest bike races. </p>\n<p>SBS holds the rights Down Under and shows start-to-finish coverage of each stage.
