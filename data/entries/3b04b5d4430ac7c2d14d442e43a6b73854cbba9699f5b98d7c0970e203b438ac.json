It might not be so big after all","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2659880/that-big-iphone-redesign-predicted-for-this-year-it-might-not-be-so-big-after-all.html","date":1744026964000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>After six generations in a row with very little change in the design of its Pro iPhone models (and three in a row with essentially <em>zero</em> change other than buttons), Apple is expected to finally shake things up this fall with the launch of the iPhone 17 handsets. But the bad news, according to a new report, is that the anticipated redesign is going to be a whole lot less radical than previously expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the latest instalment of his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on\">Power On</a> newsletter, Bloomberg leaker Mark Gurman says that while the late-2025 handsets will be a departure from the same old look, representing the line’s biggest redesign since 2020, the iPhone 17 Pro “will look a lot more like the 16 Pro than anticipated.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When viewed from the front, Gurman claims, the iPhone 17 Pro will look much the same as its predecessor, with any noticeable changes limited to the rear of the device, specifically the camera module. The 17 Pro is still expected to feature three rear-facing camera lenses in a “two left, one right” triangular configuration, but these will be housed in a wider module that spans almost the entire width of the chassis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, this isn’t a new rumor. In fact, this precise rumor was covered on this site in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2609153/leak-reveals-iphone-17-pros-bizarre-redesigned-camera-module.html\">mid-February</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2617275/leaked-iphone-17-cad-images-reveal-three-different-camera-designs.html\">later that month</a>. The wide-module concept isn’t a certainty (sources could be wrong, and with five months to go until the launch it’s just about possible that Apple could yet change its mind) but it’s the current consensus among pundits and should be regarded as the most plausible outcome at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more interesting about Gurman’s article is what it tells us about the other parts of the 17-series iPhones. Namely, that earlier reports were wrong, and they’re staying the same. Renders showing a two-tone design are “not an accurate representation of what’s to come,” he insists; the module will be the same color as the rest of the phone. And if the 17 Pro looks the same as the 16 Pro from the front, that implies that Apple doesn’t intend to make any changes to the size or position of the Dynamic Island, and certainly doesn’t plan to remove the cutout entirely in favor of an under-screen sensor array.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might seem disappointing, but Apple-watching veterans won’t be surprised. A long way out, the company’s products often get talked up by leakers and rumormongers as grand and radical reimaginings, but as the launch approaches and reality bites, pundits become more cautious and hint that major changes have been bumped to the following year when the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1917011/iphone-16-rumors-exciting-update-next-year.html\">process will repeat</a>. It looks like this year won’t be any different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the latest news and rumors as we head towards the biggest launch of the year, check out our regularly updated <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17</a> superguide.
