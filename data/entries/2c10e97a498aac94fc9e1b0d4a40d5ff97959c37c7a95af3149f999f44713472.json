But while the company says publicly that it does what it can to remove kids' accounts, US states suing Meta say they have evidence that the company routinely ignores reports of underage users.</p>\n<p>\"Within the company, Meta's actual knowledge that millions of Instagram users are under the age of 13 is an open secret that is routinely documented, rigorously analyzed and confirmed, and zealously protected from disclosure to the public,\" said a <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.419868/gov.uscourts.cand.419868.73.2.pdf\">newly unredacted</a> complaint released last week.</p>\n<p>Meta received 1.1 million reports of under-13 users on Instagram between 2019 and the first half of 2023, but \"disabled only a fraction of those accounts and routinely continued to collect children's data without parental consent,\" the complaint said. In 2021, Meta received over 402,000 reports of under-13 Instagram users through its website and app reporting systems, but its \"records show that fewer than 164,000—far fewer than half of the reported accounts—were 'disabled for potentially being under the age of 13' that year,\" the lawsuit said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986474#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986474&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2c10e97a498aac94fc9e1b0d4a40d5ff97959c37c7a95af3149f999f44713472","category":"Tech"}
