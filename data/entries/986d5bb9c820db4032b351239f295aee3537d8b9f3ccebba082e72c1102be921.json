Sure, the fifth-generation iPhone’s\nsuperb camera and speedy dual-core processor are classy additions.\nBut Siri is the reason people should buy this phone. […]</p>\n\n<p>The iPhone 4S looks exactly the same as its predecessor — but who\ncares? If it was shaped even slightly differently or came in a new\ncolor, people would still go nuts over the stuff that’s more\nimportant anyway: the insides. And both inside and out, this is a\nmagnificent smartphone.</p>\n\n<p>The late Steve Jobs once called the computer the equivalent of a\nbicycle for our minds. I think of the smartphone as the rocket\nship for our minds. With increasingly powerful sensors and\ntechnologies, and access to hundreds of thousands of apps enabling\nus to do just about anything, the iPhone keeps soaring to\nincredible heights and taking us to places with limitless\npotential. I guess that’s what you have to do to create a ding in\nthe universe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t know what happened to the fellow who wrote this review 10 years ago, but The New York Times <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/22/review-from-another-planet\">could sure use</a> a personal tech critic with this sort of enthusiasm and insight into the way that incremental improvements aggregate in just a few years in profound ways.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/22/wired-2011-iphone-4s-review\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"986d5bb9c820db4032b351239f295aee3537d8b9f3ccebba082e72c1102be921","category":"Tech"}
