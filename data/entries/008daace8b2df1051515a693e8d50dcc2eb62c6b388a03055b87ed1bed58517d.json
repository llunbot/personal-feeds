The headphones did not receive Apple's H2 chip that debuted in the AirPods Pro 2 a few years ago, meaning that they will continue to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-airpods/\">miss out on Adaptive Audio features</a>, and there are no improvements to active noise cancellation either.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple first released the AirPods Max in December 2020, so the headphones are nearly four years old and continue to have the H1 chip from 2019.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe updated AirPods Max can be pre-ordered now and launch on Friday, September 20, with U.S. pricing remaining set at $549. Competing over-ear headphones include the Sony XM5, Sonos Ace, and Bose QuietComfort Ultra, for customers who may consider alternatives after the AirPods Max failed to receive any major changes this week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/airpods-max-still-lack-h2-chip/\">AirPods Max Still Lack H2 Chip Following Minor Update With USB-C Port and New Colors</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-max-still-lack-h2-chip-following-minor-update-with-usb-c-port-and-new-colors.2435728/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"008daace8b2df1051515a693e8d50dcc2eb62c6b388a03055b87ed1bed58517d","category":"Apple"}
