That’s buy-one-get-one-free, a term that’s normally not associated with the purchase of a complete bicycle. Then again, this hasn’t been a normal year for sales. As a result of many bike industry brands carrying far too much inventory into the new year, we’re seeing Black Friday deals that started well before Black Friday transition into fire sales as bike brands try to move aging products. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Buy One Get One Free Mountain Bikes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t the first <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bogo-bikes-wheelsets-marin-spinergy-offer-crazy-deals/\" target=\"_blank\">BOGO bike deal we’ve seen this year</a>, but in terms of bicycle value, the appropriately named <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=28441&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brdlgearbikingKonabikes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.konaworld.com%2F\">Kona N+1 sale is the craziest yet</a>. Although, maybe this should be named the N+2 sale where N is the number of bikes you currently have since buying a new Kona Process means you’re getting two. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From now until December 31st, 2023, Kona is offering a buy-one-get-one-free deal on any in-stock <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aluminum-kona-process-x-dh-and-process-x-park-freeride-enduro/\">Kona Process full-suspension mountain bike</a>.
