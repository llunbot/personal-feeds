For all intents and purposes, you get the same proven Speed tech, but with some sponsored rider-like updates. Most obvious is those flashy chrome graphics, a direct request from customers. Plus, tucked under your cassette, you’ll also find a lighter freehub body that spins on premium ceramic bearings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 Fulcrum Speed Team aero carbon road wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_riding.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_riding.webp\" alt=\"2025 Fulcrum Speed Team 42|57 aero carbon road wheels, airport riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_riding.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_riding-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_riding-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_riding-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Fulcrum)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple seasons ago, Fulcrum updated their premium aero road wheels with a new pair of lighter and faster <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fulcrum-speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">Speed 42 &amp; 57 wheelsets</a> featuring new direct-out-of-the-mold matte carbon finishes and low-key laser-etched graphics. Plus, a lot of other significant performance upgrades. And the wheels were pretty great. They even got a very similar but more affordable pair of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fulcrum-wind-42-57-aero-carbon-road-gravel-wheels-deliver-more-affordable-speed/\" target=\"_blank\">Wind 42 &amp; 57</a> wheels just a couple of months later. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_new-lighter-red-freehub-body.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_new-lighter-red-freehub-body.webp\" alt=\"2025 Fulcrum Speed Team 42|57 aero carbon road wheels, new lighter red freehub body\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_new-lighter-red-freehub-body.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_new-lighter-red-freehub-body-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_new-lighter-red-freehub-body-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_new-lighter-red-freehub-body-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_new-lighter-red-freehub-body-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_new-lighter-red-freehub-body-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most riders were super happy with the new subtle look. But many still longed for that professional rider style. So Fulcrum decided to make everyone happy and give the Speeds a little facelift with some big flashy chrome Fulcrum graphics. But instead of just making this an aesthetics-only update, they made some lighter-weight, machined-out red alloy freehub bodies to shave a couple of grams off at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles.webp\" alt=\"2025 Fulcrum Speed Team 42|57 aero carbon road wheels, rim sections\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>aero blunt-nosed carbon rims, made in Romania</li>\n\n\n\n<li>23mm internal 2-Way-fit hooked tubeless carbon rim</li>\n\n\n\n<li>42mm or 57mm deep x max 29.3mm wide</li>\n\n\n\n<li>optimized aerodynamics for 28mm or 30mm tires</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MoMag continuous rim bed, so NO tubeless tape needed</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_57mm-rim-graphics-detail.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_57mm-rim-graphics-detail.webp\" alt=\"2025 Fulcrum Speed Team 42|57 aero carbon road wheels, rim graphics detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_57mm-rim-graphics-detail.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_57mm-rim-graphics-detail-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_57mm-rim-graphics-detail-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_57mm-rim-graphics-detail-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_57mm-rim-graphics-detail-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Fulcrum-Speed-Team-42_57-aero-carbon-road-wheels_57mm-rim-graphics-detail-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>‘Direct Inmold Matt Finish’ with laser-etched graphics, plus new water-transfer silver chrome logos</li>\n\n\n\n<li>aluminum hubs with 2:1 lacing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>24 double-butted, aero-bladed stainless steel straight-pull spokes, front &amp;
