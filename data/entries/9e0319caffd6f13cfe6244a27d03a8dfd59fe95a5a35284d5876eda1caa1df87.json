Clownfish, like many other species, are feeling the stress of rising temperatures and other environmental stressors. Fortunately, they have a superpower to cope: They can shrink their body size during dangerous heat waves to substantially boost their odds of survival, according to a <a href=\"http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt7079\">new paper</a> published in the journal Science Advances.</p>\n<p>“This is not just about getting skinnier under stressful conditions; these fish are actually getting shorter,\" <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084161\">said co-author Melissa Versteeg</a>, a graduate student at Newcastle University. \"We don’t know yet exactly how they do it, but we do know that a few other animals can do this too.\"</p>\n<p>Many vertebrates have shown <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38361476/#:~:text=By%20analysing%20~15%2C000%20coastal%2Dreef,%C2%B0C%20mean%20annual%20SST.\">growth decline</a> in response to environmental stressors, especially higher temperatures.

This can also happen when there is less food available. And social factors can also influence growth. When female meerkats, for example, are dominant, they have <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15341161/\">growth spurts</a>, while a disruption in their social status can cause <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10570217/\">stunted growth</a> in male <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cichlid\">cichlids</a></p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/incredible-shrinking-clownfish-beats-the-heat/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/incredible-shrinking-clownfish-beats-the-heat/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9e0319caffd6f13cfe6244a27d03a8dfd59fe95a5a35284d5876eda1caa1df87","category":"Tech"}
