The only slight problem is that it’s currently backordered until mid-January, but you may be able to pick it up locally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In true carrier fashion, the $600 cost of the phone will be spread out in bill credits over 24 or 30 months, but otherwise there is no fine print. Verizon’s Unlimited plans start at $70 a month and all include nationwide 5G, and at least six months of Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+, Discovery+, Apple Arcade, and Apple Music. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 12 mini is a smaller version of the iPhone 12, with a 5.4-inch display, but otherwise has all of the same features as the larger model. It has a dual camera, A15 processor, Face ID, and MagSafe support. In <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234921/iphone-12-mini-review-a-concentration-not-a-reduction.html\">our 4.5-star review</a>, we wrote that the iPhone 12 mini is “the smallest possible phone that doesn’t compromise or cut corners,” and a year later it hasn’t lost much of its luster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was when the price was $699. For free, it’s an absolute no-brainer.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fd7faba7cbc2fa44e075ade62347ecab6a50cf1fb6257dbd96e0d1d671f66d18","category":"Apple"}
