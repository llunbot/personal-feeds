Shipments for the first half of the year for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> lineup will increase by 30%, according to the report, but the entire year's performance will also be impacted by the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> in the fall.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/01/iphone-13-demand-weakening/\">reported earlier this month</a> that Apple was informing its suppliers to lower production of the ‌iPhone‌ amid lower demand. ‌iPhone 13‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a> availability had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/01/iphone-13-pro-one-month-delay-shipments/\">initially been unreliable</a> due to high demand coupled with the ongoing chip shortage. Today's report suggests that Apple is expecting demand to rebound in early 2022, and furthermore, is expecting a bigger year overall fueled by the ‌iPhone 14‌ in the fall.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13\">iPhone 13 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13-Pro\">iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/07/iphone-shipments-increase-first-half-2022/\">Apple Reportedly Increasing iPhone Shipments by 30% in First Half of 2022</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-increasing-iphone-shipments-by-30-in-first-half-of-2022.2326519/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UJu0kPL5uck:BqUOEnm2-KQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UJu0kPL5uck:BqUOEnm2-KQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a57df6c8d4a13cbf15abca592dda6906750196d58eab7663ffc21d86d141c6d3","category":"Apple"}
