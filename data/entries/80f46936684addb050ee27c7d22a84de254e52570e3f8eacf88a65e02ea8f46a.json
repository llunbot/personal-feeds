Fortunately, after more than a four-year wait, a new model is finally expected to launch later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/homepod-mini-thumb-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nEarlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple is aiming to launch the new HomePod mini \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/\">toward the end of the year</a>.\" According to his reporting, the speaker will be equipped with Apple's own <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/\">combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a>, with Wi-Fi 6E support. The current HomePod mini supports Wi-Fi 4, so Wi-Fi 6E would be an upgrade, enabling faster and more reliable Wi-Fi connectivity for Siri, music playback, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile there are no other firm rumors yet, likely upgrades for the next HomePod mini include a newer \"S\" chip, improved sound quality, new color options, and a newer Ultra Wideband chip for a lower-latency Handoff experience. The current HomePod mini is equipped with the S5 chip, which debuted in 2019's Apple Watch Series 5.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to a new HomePod mini, Apple reportedly plans to release an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/26/homepod-hub-with-7-inch-screen-rumor/\">all-new smart home hub</a> at some point this year. The hub is expected to feature around a 6-inch to 7-inch display that can be mounted on a wall, or attached to a tabletop base with a speaker, so the device could be similar to the HomePod mini in some ways.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe home hub is expected to support Apple Intelligence, but the next HomePod mini is not.
