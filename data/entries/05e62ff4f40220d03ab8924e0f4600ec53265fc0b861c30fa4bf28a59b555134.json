The outcome of each mission's confirmation review typically establishes a budgetary and schedule commitment.</p>\n<p>“Dragonfly is a spectacular science mission with broad community interest, and we are excited to take the next steps on this mission,\" said Nicky Fox, associate administrator of NASA's science mission directorate. \"Exploring Titan will push the boundaries of what we can do with rotorcraft outside of Earth.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018959#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018959&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"05e62ff4f40220d03ab8924e0f4600ec53265fc0b861c30fa4bf28a59b555134","category":"Tech"}
