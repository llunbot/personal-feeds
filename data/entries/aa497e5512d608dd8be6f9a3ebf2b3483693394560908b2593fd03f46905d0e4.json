However, according to Korean news site <em><a href=\"https://www.hankooki.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=146958\">hankooki.com</a></em>, Samsung has recently faced poor yields of the ~11-inch OLED panels, and it has been unable to meet Apple's order quantity. The shortfall has led Apple to transfer some orders for the smaller panel to LG Display. The latter is subsequently expected to increase its order by hundreds of thousands of units going into next month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven the reallocation, LG Display is now likely to supply 60% of the panels for the upcoming iPad Pro models. The company has invested millions of dollars into its sixth-generation small- and medium-sized OLED production line, and has now passed Apple's quality control standards for the smaller panels, enabling it to take up the slack from Samsung.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/apple-produce-8-5-million-oled-ipad-pro/\">ordered</a> an initial 8.5 million OLED display panels from the South Korean suppliers. Apple's latest shipments forecast is said to have been a decrease from the 10 million units that were projected for 2024 last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is rumored to be aiming for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/oled-ipad-lightweight-design-and-image-quality/\">\"unrivaled\" display quality</a> with the new iPad Pro models, which will use a tandem OLED structure. The tandem structure is a method of stacking two layers of OLED light-emitting layers. It is superior to the luminance (screen brightness) and lifespan of a single OLED structure with one light-emitting layer. The iPhone currently uses a single stack OLED display with one light-emitting layer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will now introduce new iPad Pro models alongside new iPad Air models in early May, according to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Apple is apparently working to \"finish software for the new devices,\" and the iPad Pro models also need \"complex new manufacturing techniques,\" which Gurman says has contributed to the delay.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/ipad-pro-delay-poor-oled-panel-yields/\">iPad Pro Delays Could Be Down to Poor OLED Panel Production Yields</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pro-delays-could-be-down-to-poor-oled-panel-production-yields.2423078/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa497e5512d608dd8be6f9a3ebf2b3483693394560908b2593fd03f46905d0e4","category":"Apple"}
