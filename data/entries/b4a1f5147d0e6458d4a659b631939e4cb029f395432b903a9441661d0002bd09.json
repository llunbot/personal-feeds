His previous response was <a href=\"https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1837197288545857721\">sent in error</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOriginal story follows.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<hr />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the iPhone 16 series just began arriving to customers today, there are already rumors about the next-generation iPhone 17 series.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Beyond-iPhone-13-Better-Blue-Face-ID-Single-Camera-Hole.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn a post shared on social media platform X on Thursday, display industry analyst Ross Young <a href=\"https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1836912096250056937\">said</a> he believes that next year's iPhone 17 Pro will feature under-display Face ID. This change would presumably extend to the iPhone 17 Pro Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnder-display Face ID has been rumored for several years, but it has failed to materialize. However, Young has a good track record with display-related information about future Apple products, including being the first source to reveal that the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/\">would feature larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays</a>, respectively. If he says the iPhone 17 Pro will have under-screen Face ID, there is a good chance it will.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn April 2023, Young shared a roadmap that showed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/\">both iPhone 17 Pro models would feature under-display Face ID</a>, but he said the devices would still have a hole in the screen for the front camera. He does not expect both under-display Face ID and an under-display front camera until the iPhone 19 Pro models in three years from now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith under-display Face ID, the iPhone 17 Pro models could have only a single hole at the top of the display, similar to recent Android smartphones from Samsung and Google. However, no specific design changes have been rumored yet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother unanswered question: Will the Dynamic Island live on with under-display Face ID?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the iPhone 17 series still a year away, there is plenty of time remaining for additional rumors, which should give us a better idea of what to expect.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/face-id/\">Face ID</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-17-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/\">iPhone 17 Pro No Longer Expected to Feature Under-Display Face ID [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-no-longer-expected-to-feature-under-display-face-id-updated.2437261/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b4a1f5147d0e6458d4a659b631939e4cb029f395432b903a9441661d0002bd09","category":"Apple"}
