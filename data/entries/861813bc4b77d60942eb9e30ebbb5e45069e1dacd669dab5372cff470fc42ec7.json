This is an overall solid second-best price on this version of the MacBook Air, and it's the first time the computer has been in stock at a steep discount in weeks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/M1-MacBook-Air-Deals-Feature-Warm.jpg\" width=\"2125\" height=\"1195\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

The M1 MacBook Air first came out in 2020, so it is four years old at this point, but the Apple silicon chip is still more than adequate for day-to-day tasks. As the M1 MacBook Air is no longer being manufactured, available supply is likely to dry up soon. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nHead to our full <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Deals Roundup</a> to get caught up with all of the latest deals and discounts that we've been tracking over the past week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/22/apples-m1-macbook-air-drops/\">Apple's M1 MacBook Air Drops to Low Price of $699 on Amazon</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-m1-macbook-air-drops-to-low-price-of-699-on-amazon.2427113/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"861813bc4b77d60942eb9e30ebbb5e45069e1dacd669dab5372cff470fc42ec7","category":"Apple"}
