Exactly the same aero shape as their new Speed, but a lot more affordable. With modern wide tubeless rims in 42mm or 57mm depths, the new Winds inherit much of Fulcrum’s top-tier <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fulcrum-speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">Speed</a> aero carbon tech, but bring it to a more accessible price point at really only a 100g weight penalty. They also get rated for light off-tarmac use, so the Wind makes road, all-road, and gravel rides quicker now, too…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fulcrum Wind affordable European aero carbon road wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fulcrum promises “supreme versatility” with the new carbon Wind 42 &amp; 57 aero road wheels. While their Speed family is a dedicated road racing wheel lineup, Fulcrum balances high-speed performance and rider comfort with these new Wind wheels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By factoring more compliance into their FF80 carbon layup development, the new Fulcrum Wind wheels readapt the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fulcrum-speed-42-57-lightweight-aero-carbon-road-bike-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">exact same aero rim profile as the Speed</a> to blur the lines between aero road and all-road. Ultimately, more comfortable and with ASTM category 2 certification, they can even handle some “light off-road riding” for fast gravel, too. With modern bikes often having room for 32-35mm tires, Fulcrum see the Wind wheel family as an opportunity to extend how you ride aero road bikes, “beyond traffic-congested roads”. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_ride-roading.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_ride-roading.jpg\" alt=\"Fulcrum Wind 42mm &amp; 57mm affordable wide European aero carbon all road wheels, photo by Chiara Redaschi, road riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_ride-roading.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_ride-roading-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_ride-roading-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_ride-roading-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_ride-roading-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_ride-roading-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_ride-roading-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_ride-roading-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c.

The wheels feature Campagnolo MoMag rim construction tech. That then means no holes are drilled for spokes in the rim bed. External nipples are guided into place with a magnet during wheel building, so rims don’t require tape for tubeless setup. Plus, they have an ultra-smooth internal finish that makes tubeless setups fast and easy. They also share the same top-tier Directional Rim-Spoke Coupling tech, which places a polymer insert under the spoke head to better distribute force into the carbon rim and prevent galvanic corrosion that can ultimately damage a wheel over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hub Tech Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_rear-hub-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_rear-hub-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Fulcrum Wind 42mm &amp; 57mm affordable wide European aero carbon all road wheels, rear hub detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_rear-hub-detail.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_rear-hub-detail-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_rear-hub-detail-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_rear-hub-detail-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_rear-hub-detail-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_rear-hub-detail-1536x960.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The centerlock disc (AFS) alloy hubs feature 12mm thru-axles with sealed cartridge bearings and preloaders.

Both depths feature Fulcrum’s latest low-key laser-etched graphics that depict key tech details. Plus, they get a small reflective logo at the valve that both blends in with any bike and boosts visibility. The fully made-in-Europe disc brake wheelsets sell for between $1614-1649 / 1415-1445€. Pricing depends on depth &amp; freehubs (<em>XDR adds about 10 bucks, and the deeper wheels cost about 20 bucks extra</em>). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_all-road-riding.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_all-road-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Fulcrum Wind 42mm &amp; 57mm affordable wide European aero carbon all road wheels, photo by Chiara Redaschi, all-road\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_all-road-riding.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_all-road-riding-297x269.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_all-road-riding-800x725.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_all-road-riding-120x109.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_all-road-riding-768x696.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fulcrum-Wind-42mm-57mm-affordable-wide-European-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_photo-by-chiara-redaschi_all-road-riding-1536x1392.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The shallower, lighter, more versatile Fulcrum Wind 42 is available to order now, from Fulcrum and their partner retailers.
