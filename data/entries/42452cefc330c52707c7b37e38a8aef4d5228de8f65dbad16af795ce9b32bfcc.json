Coates posted a photo of herself trying on a bridal gown in front of two mirrors that shows her in three separate poses at the same time: She’s standing with one arm at her side and one arm across her waist; the left reflection shows her with both arms at her side, and the right reflection shows her with her hands clasped in front her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coates, who is co-host of the podcast “Nobody Panic,” called the shot a “glitch in the matrix” that made her “nearly vomit in the street.” However, the explanation is likely much less worrisome. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.threads.net/@ayfondo/post/C0VzJWCuwnU&amp;xcust=1-1-2160727-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">According to Faruk Korkmaz of the iPhonedo YouTube channel</a>, the image is likely a perfect mistake of a panoramic photo—even though Coates claims it wasn’t taken in Pano mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CzPGNmJIebC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading&amp;xcust=1-1-2160727-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CzPGNmJIebC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading&amp;xcust=1-1-2160727-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Tessa Coates (@wheatpraylove)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As he describes, the photo, which was taken with an iPhone 12, is 3028 x 3948 instead of the standard main camera resolution of 4516 x 3874. That resolution precisely matches the resolution of a panoramic photo. Since Coates was likely moving her arms in different positions as the photo was shot, the iPhone’s panoramic system treated them as separate people and expertly stitched them together as if it were three people standing together. And the person snapping the photo could have easily taken it in Pano mode without even realizing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve seen plenty of photos like this before. Instagram even has a #panoramafail hashtag dedicated to thousands of pictures showcasing glitchy panorama shots taken on iPhone and Android phones. Since panoramic mode stitches photos together and uses AI to re-create a full scene, images of people <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.insider.com/panorama-pictures-gone-wrong-iphone-android-2017-7&amp;xcust=1-1-2160727-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">can go very wrong at times</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So resume reality as you know it. There’s (probably) nothing to see here.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"42452cefc330c52707c7b37e38a8aef4d5228de8f65dbad16af795ce9b32bfcc","category":"Apple"}
