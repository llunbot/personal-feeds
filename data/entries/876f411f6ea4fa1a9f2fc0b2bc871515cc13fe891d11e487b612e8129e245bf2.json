Games until <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/news/529310/warner-bros-games-monolith-productions-multiversus-studio-closure\">yesterday's multi-studio shutdown</a>, had a notable track record across more than 30 years, having made <em>Blood, </em><em>No One Lives Forever</em>, <em>Shogo: Mobile Armor Division</em>, <em>F.E.A.R., </em>and, most recently, the Lord of the Rings series, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/09/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-a-shadow-of-its-own-ambition/\"><em>Shadow of Mordor</em></a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/05/shadow-of-war-hands-on-latest-lotr-game-will-be-hard-but-will-it-be-fun/\"><em>Shadow of War</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Those games, derived from J.R.R. Tolkien's fiction, had a \"Nemesis System,\" in which the enemies that beat the player or survive a battle with them can advance in level, develop distinct strengths and weaknesses, and become an interesting subplot and motivation in the game. Monolith's next game, the now-canceled <em>Wonder Woman,</em> was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyA8lnp9Tzg\">teased more than three years ago</a>, and said to be \"powered by the Nemesis System.\"</p>\n<p>Not only will <em>Wonder Woman</em> not be powered by the Nemesis System, but likely no other games will be, either, at least until August 2036. That's when \"Nemesis characters, nemesis forts, social vendettas and followers in computer games,\" patent <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160279522A1/en\">US2016279522A1</a>, is due to expire. Until then, any game that wants to implement gameplay involving showdowns, factions, and bitter NPC feelings toward a player must either differentiate it enough to avoid infringement, license it from Warner Brothers, or gamble on WB Games' legal attention.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/wb-axes-shadow-of-mordor-maker-in-setback-for-clever-sadly-patented-game-system/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/wb-axes-shadow-of-mordor-maker-in-setback-for-clever-sadly-patented-game-system/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"876f411f6ea4fa1a9f2fc0b2bc871515cc13fe891d11e487b612e8129e245bf2","category":"Tech"}
