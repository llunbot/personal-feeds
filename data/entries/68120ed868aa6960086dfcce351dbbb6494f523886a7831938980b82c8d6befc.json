Constructed by the Incas over several centuries and partly based on pre-Inca infrastructure, this extraordinary network through one of the world’s most extreme geographical terrains linked the snow-capped peaks of the Andes – at an altitude of more than 6,000 m – to the coast, running through hot rainforests, fertile valleys, and absolute deserts.</p>\n<p>It reached its maximum expansion in the 15th century when it spread across the length and breadth of the Andes.

Our full film will be launched later this year showcasing this wild adventure full of mishaps, reroutes due to food shortages, days where water was inaccessible, alpaca killings, a visit to the highest mining settlement in the world, and much more.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/reroutes-in-search-of-the-qhapaq-nan/\">Reroutes: In Search of The Qhapaq Ñan</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"68120ed868aa6960086dfcce351dbbb6494f523886a7831938980b82c8d6befc","category":"Cycling"}
