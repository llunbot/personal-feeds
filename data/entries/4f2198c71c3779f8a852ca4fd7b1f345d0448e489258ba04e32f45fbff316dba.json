The VR is the everyday bike for most riders, blending performance with long-distance comfort. For 2024, both bikes get better at their respective games when they launch in February.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 Felt FR</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-5.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-5.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Felt FR road bike prototype shown from side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-5.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-5-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-5-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Felt FR maintains its racy character but introduces more aerodynamic efforts to help you save a few watts. The mostly-internal routing starts with the handlebar with cables popping out near the stem, where they run into a channel underneath it, then through the headset and into the frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1820\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-3.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2024 Felt FR road bike prototype\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-3.jpg 1820w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-3-297x220.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-3-800x593.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-3-120x89.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-3-768x570.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-3-1536x1139.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This lets Felt keep the bar and stem separate to make it easier to install and service…and swap bar and stem sizes to customize the fit and swap in any personal favorites…for the bar, at least. Any aftermarket stem will have to work with the routing through the headset.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-2.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-2.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Felt FR road bike prototype shown from angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-2.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the bike has sharper, straighter lines and corners than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-1.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-1.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2024 Felt FR road bike prototype\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-1.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-FR-race-road-bike-sneak-peek-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in 2024, they have an ultralight, sub-700g version coming, too. While they won’t say anything more than that it uses a “special layup”, Felt was one of the first brands to fully embrace TeXtreme fibers and create some very light yet strong frames with it, so it’ll be interesting to see what they have up their tight, aero jersey sleeves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 Felt VR</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Felt VR endurance road bike shown from an angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve ridden the VR over the years, and it’s an excellent bike. For 2024, it follows trends by increasing tire clearance to 700×38, allowing it to head into “fast gravel” territory without giving up anything that’s made it a great all-road endurance bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-2.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-2.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Felt VR endurance road bike shown from an side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-2.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They add a new vibration-damping system at the seatpost collar to smooth rough roads. Based on the slim seatpost shown with a thicker than necessary seat tube, we’re guessing there’s an elastomer sleeve in there (or similar).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-3.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-3-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"closeup of cockpit on 2024 Felt VR endurance road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-3-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-3.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Up front, it gets the same aero two-piece bar &amp; stem combo as the FR, too. It looks like the top tube bag mounts go away, which is a bummer, but maybe these are pre-production models without all of the bells and whistles shown.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-4.jpg\"><img width=\"1820\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-4.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Felt VR endurance road bike shown from an angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-4.jpg 1820w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-4-297x220.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-4-800x593.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-4-120x89.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-4-768x570.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2024-Felt-VR-endurance-road-bike-sneak-peek-4-1536x1139.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The seatstays meet the seat tube lower than before, which should help in overall compliance, working well with the seatpost systems and larger tires to make it a fast and comfortable bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.feltbicycles.com\" target=\"_blank\">FeltBicycles.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/felt-teases-vr-endurance-road-ultralight-fr-race-bikes/\">Felt Teases New VR Endurance Road &amp; Ultralight FR Race Bikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"4f2198c71c3779f8a852ca4fd7b1f345d0448e489258ba04e32f45fbff316dba","category":"Cycling"}
