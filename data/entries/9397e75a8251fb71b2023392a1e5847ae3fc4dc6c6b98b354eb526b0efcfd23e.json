Sure, my elementary school computer lab had both the Apple IIGS and Apple IIc, and one of them was slightly more useful, for reasons unexplained to me. But soon after my father brought home his office's discarded Gateway desktop with a 486DX 33 MHz inside, I was catapulted into my first Intel sorting scheme. I learned there was an x86 before this one (i386), and there were models with different trailing numbers (16â€“100 MHz) and \"DX\" levels. This was my first grasp of what hardware I was actually using and what could improve inside it.</p>\n<p>More than 36 years after the release of the 486 and 18 years after <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20061009060120/http://developer.intel.com/design/pcn/Processors/D0106013.pdf\">Intel stopped making them</a>, leaders of the Linux kernel believe the project can improve itself by leaving i486 support behind. Ingo Molnar, <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250425084216.3913608-1-mingo@kernel.org/\">quoting Linus Torvalds</a> regarding \"zero real reason for anybody to waste one second\" on 486 support, submitted a patch series to the 6.15 kernel that updates its minimum support features. Those requirements now include TSC (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter\">Time Stamp Counter</a>) and CX8 (i.e., \"fixed\" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Older_implementations\">CMPXCH8B</a>, its own <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000008595/processors.html\">whole thing</a>), features that the 486 lacks (as do some early non-Pentium 586 processors).</p>\n<p>It's not the first time Torvalds has suggested dropping support for 32-bit processors and relieving kernel developers from implementing archaic emulation and work-around solutions. \"We got rid of i386 support back in 2012. Maybe it's time to get rid of i486 support in 2022,\" <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wikUaRM5H_y1Bc+QyvGi40dKDL8fnCTyz7ECbwK7aHNPQ@mail.gmail.com/\">Torvalds wrote in October 2022</a>.
