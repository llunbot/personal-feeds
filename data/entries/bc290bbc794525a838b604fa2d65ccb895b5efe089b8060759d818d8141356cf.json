After all, Apple frequently talks about the robust design of its phones and their ability to withstand drops and scratches. What’s more, it seems a shame to hide such an attractive piece of kit inside a protective covering. Should you buy a case?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is yes. It’s true that iPhones are tougher than they used to be, but Apple has yet to invent the unbreakable smartphone; browse any Apple-focused forum and you’ll see numerous complaints about broken screens and scuffed casings. It isn’t worth the risk–and the cost of a protective case is a fraction of the cost of buying a new iPhone (or getting one repaired).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you’re concerned about appearances, consider this: an uncased iPhone looks stunning, but it won’t look so nice if you drop it on the floor. And there are some very attractive cases out there if you know where to look. Which is where we come in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Which iPhone case should I pick?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot of choice out there, so it’s important to understand what you need from an iPhone 16 case. Obviously it must deliver <strong>top-class protection</strong> against drops, nicks and scratches. We’ve covered aesthetics, too: it needs to <strong>look fantastic</strong>. But there’s more to this decision than toughness and looks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re dealing with the new iPhone 16 handsets, you need to make sure the case has been designed with those devices’ design in mind. Apple added a new <strong>Camera Control</strong> on the righthand edge, and there’s no point buying a case if it fails to protect this delicate feature properly, or covers it up in such a way that it can’t be used. Similarly, you need a case that accommodates the <strong>Action button</strong> that debuted on the Pro iPhones in 2023 and was added to the standard models in the latest generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond protecting the phone, does the case offer any <strong>additional features </strong>of its own? Is it compatible with Apple’s MagSafe charging technology? And finally, is your case sold for a fair price by a <strong>reputable company</strong> with experience in this field and numerous positive customer reviews?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ESR’s new Stash Stand for the iPhone 16</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it sounds like we’re asking for a lot. But as it happens, we’ve found an iPhone 16 case that meets all these criteria. The great news is that the long-established accessories maker <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/C481BD72-9AE2-4927-B290-BC543AD7B0DA?maas=maas_adg_9504025F01EDDAB8F531418C24A03CAA_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas\">ESR</a> has updated its popular <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMNSDJQM?maas=maas_adg_1BD06AB4685C69871BCA249C58F1783C_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas\">Stash Stand case for the iPhone 16</a></strong>, and it has everything you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated Stash Stand has been carefully modified to accommodate the iPhone 16’s unique design, an area many rival brands overlook. It features a patented three-layer cover for the Camera Control, keeping out dust and maintaining durability while retaining that popular caseless feel. The control is protected but still fully usable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And aside from this crucial design breakthrough, you’re getting the same great Stash Stand case you know and love. The ultra-slim profile: just 1.6mm thick. The shock-absorbing Air Guard corners and raised screen edges, delivering 11-foot drop protection, and powerful scratch resistance from the camera guard. The top-class MagSafe compatibility, both in terms of grip strength (1,500g, more than twice that of Apple’s cases!) and charging speed. And of course, as the name suggests, you get that pop-out stand for convenient hands-free use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brilliant new Stash Stand costs just <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMNSDJQM?maas=maas_adg_1BD06AB4685C69871BCA249C58F1783C_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas\">$22.99 from Amazon</a>.
