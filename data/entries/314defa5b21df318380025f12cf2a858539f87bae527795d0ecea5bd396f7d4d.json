It's available for $20/month in the US or 18 pounds/month in the UK, and it promises five-times-higher usage limits, priority access to Claude during high-traffic periods, and early access to new features as they emerge.</p>\n<p>Like ChatGPT, Claude Pro can compose text, summarize, do analysis, solve logic puzzles, and more.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/new-chatgpt-rival-claude-2-launches-for-open-beta-testing/\">Claude.ai</a> is what Anthropic offers as its conversational interface for its Claude 2 AI language model, similar to how ChatGPT provides an application wrapper for the underlying models GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. In February, OpenAI chose a subscription route for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/chatgpt-sets-record-for-fastest-growing-user-base-in-history-report-says/\">ChatGPT Plus</a>, which for $20 a month also gives early access to new features, but it also unlocks access to GPT-4, which is OpenAI's most powerful language model.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966121#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966121&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"314defa5b21df318380025f12cf2a858539f87bae527795d0ecea5bd396f7d4d","category":"Tech"}
