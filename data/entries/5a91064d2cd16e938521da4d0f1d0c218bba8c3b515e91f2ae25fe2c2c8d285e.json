{"title":"Anker’s $20 Nano Pro 20W Charger","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Durable-Compact-Included/dp/B099F2H5KH/?tag=df-amzn-20","date":1631208111000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/09/amazon-omni-fire-tv-sets\">Speaking of</a> stuff you can buy from Amazon — with affiliate links that could make me rich — I highly recommend Anker’s small 20-watt Nano chargers. Basically, they’re the size of Apple’s classic 5-watt chargers, and thus fit almost anywhere, but they charge at the same speed as Apple’s much-larger new 20-watt chargers. These new models from Anker come in four colors: white, black, lavender, and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/32160109/ucla-football-turns-comment-made-lsu-coach-ed-orgeron-shirt-creation\">sissy blue</a>. If you or anyone you know is getting a new iPhone soon, I would strongly recommend one of Anker’s chargers over Apple’s — same speed, same price, <em>much</em> smaller, and a few color options to top it off.</p>\n\n<p>Another Anker charger I’ve been meaning to recommend is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Delivery-Charger-PowerPort-Compact/dp/B07PT7XMP9/?tag=df-amzn-20\">Atom PowerPort III Slim</a>. It’s a 30-watt charger currently on sale for $19, and what makes it different is that it’s, well, very slim (including folding prongs). This charger will fit behind furniture that’s pushed up against the wall.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/09/anker-nano-pro-20w-charger\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5a91064d2cd16e938521da4d0f1d0c218bba8c3b515e91f2ae25fe2c2c8d285e","category":"Tech"}
