Once installed, ‌‌‌watchOS 8.3‌‌‌ can be downloaded through the dedicated Apple Watch app on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> by going to General &gt; Software update.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo update to new software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNo new features were found in the first beta of watchOS 8.3, so we don't yet know what's included in the update. It's also not clear why Apple has numbered this update 8.3 instead of 8.2. Should new features be discovered in the second beta, we'll update this article.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/apple-seeds-watchos-8-3-beta-2-to-developers/\">Apple Seeds Second Beta of watchOS 8.3 to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-watchos-8-3-to-developers.2322583/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Fru07qjxnoA:WCoYrGBoNGk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Fru07qjxnoA:WCoYrGBoNGk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Fru07qjxnoA\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f1c95919fab2d687e0a9334d9051b0de9f510cd736d8bb777df25af785c3dda9","category":"Apple"}
