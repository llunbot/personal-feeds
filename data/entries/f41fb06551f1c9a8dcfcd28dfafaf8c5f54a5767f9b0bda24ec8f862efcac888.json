That person told Said that ISIS’s chief\ndesigner gave him the nickname The Nightmare because of the\nextensive notes and revisions that were required before any\npiece of propaganda he worked on was pushed out. The DOJ\ndocument suggested that The Nightmare himself had many revisions\nfor Said’s graphic design work.</p>\n\n<p>“You can call me the Dawlawi [ISIS] designer or you can call me\nas the brother used to before. He used to send his designs for me\nto modify and because of the many changes, he used to be scared of\nme so he would call me ‘the nightmare,’” a message from The\nNightmare to Said published by the DOJ said. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The FBI obtained what it says are notes on one propaganda image\nallegedly created by Said and which The Nightmare tore apart\nbecause it had so many design elements that it was not very\nlegible or effective as a piece of propaganda, and suggested that\nSaid should both simplify it and add blood effects to parts of it\nto better get the point across.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the Trump 2.0 administration goes full fascist, I think I’ve found my role in the resistance.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/19/the-nightmare-isis-graphic-designer\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f41fb06551f1c9a8dcfcd28dfafaf8c5f54a5767f9b0bda24ec8f862efcac888","category":"Tech"}
