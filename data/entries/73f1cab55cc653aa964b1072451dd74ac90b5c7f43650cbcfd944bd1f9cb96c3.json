{"title":"Signal Introduces Usernames","link":"https://signal.org/blog/phone-number-privacy-usernames/","date":1709766041000,"content":"\n<p>Signal:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Usernames in Signal do not function like usernames on social media \nplatforms. <em>Signal usernames are not logins or handles that you’ll \nbe known by on the app — they’re simply a quick way to connect \nwithout sharing a phone number.</em> [...] </p>\n\n<p>Usernames simply allow you to initiate a connection on Signal \nwithout sharing your phone number, and Signal’s robust privacy \nsafeguards remain unchanged. Signal is built so that we do not \nknow who you message, what you say, which group chats you \nparticipate in, who’s in your contact list, and more. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to create a username, you can do so in Settings &gt; \nProfile. A username on Signal (unlike a profile name) must be \nunique and must have two or more numbers at the end of it; a \nchoice intended to help keep usernames egalitarian and minimize \nspoofing. Usernames can be changed as often as you like, and you \ncan delete your username entirely if you prefer to no longer \nhave one. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clever solution. Especially given that these usernames aren’t like social media handles, I particularly like the “every username gets at least 2 digits appended” rule.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/06/signal-usernames\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"73f1cab55cc653aa964b1072451dd74ac90b5c7f43650cbcfd944bd1f9cb96c3","category":"Tech"}
