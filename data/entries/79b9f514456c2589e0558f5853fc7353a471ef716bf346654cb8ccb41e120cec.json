Tire Project at reTyre is Froiedemann Ohse. He elaborates on the meticulous process that goes into achieving carbon neutrality. “<em>The product carbon footprint of this tire is based on our third-party verified LCA, including the end-of-life, which is how we measure all our products. Our production and transportation processes are optimized to be close to zero emissions</em>“. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohse continues, “<em>End-of-life is reduced to almost zero due to the recycling of the tires. The algae used in the tire has a negative CO2 equivalent, balancing any remaining emissions to achieve a net-zero impact. In this way, we have a carbon-neutral product without using any of the well-known shortcuts, such as carbon quotas, subsidies, or other non-product related contributions.</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Global Effort</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-the-Bio-Based-Tire.jpeg\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-the-Bio-Based-Tire.jpeg\" alt=\"reTyre World's First Carbon-Neutral Tire the Bio-Based Tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-the-Bio-Based-Tire.jpeg 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-the-Bio-Based-Tire-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-the-Bio-Based-Tire-90x120.jpeg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-the-Bio-Based-Tire-768x1024.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ReTyre collaborates with global suppliers to responsibly source their materials. For instance, the algae used in the process is harvested from lakes and oceans worldwide and is supported by the UN Ecosystem Restoration Program.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Unique Materials + Manufacturing Possibilities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using its 100% sustainable product portfolio, reTyre can offer brands a wide range of sustainable tires without compromising quality. By using bio-based and 100% renewable materials that have never been used before, reTyre significantly reduces emissions and produces fully reusable tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach reduces GHG emissions by up to 82% compared to conventional tires. Friedmann Ohse also said, “<em>This carbon-neutral tire is at a concept stage and it is a result of continuous innovation that shows what our unique manufacturing is capable of</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-front-frog-tire.jpeg\"><img width=\"720\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-front-frog-tire.jpeg\" alt=\"reTyre World's First Carbon-Neutral Tire front frog tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-front-frog-tire.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-front-frog-tire-169x300.jpeg 169w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reTyre-Worlds-First-Carbon-Neutral-Tire-front-frog-tire-68x120.jpeg 68w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Eurobike Debut</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the groundbreaking carbon-neutral tire, reTyre showed its <a href=\"https://www.retyre.eco/sustainable-tyres/bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">full range of sustainable products</a>, including the new City Range tires designed for the urban cyclist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.retyre.eco/\" target=\"_blank\">reTyre.eco</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/retyre-unveils-worlds-first-carbon-neutral-tire/\">reTyre Unveils ‘World’s First Carbon-Neutral Tire’ at This Year’s Eurobike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"79b9f514456c2589e0558f5853fc7353a471ef716bf346654cb8ccb41e120cec","category":"Cycling"}
