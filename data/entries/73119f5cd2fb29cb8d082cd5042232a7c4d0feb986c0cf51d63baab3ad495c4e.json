I was going to tack on an “alas” <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack\">re: building on Substack</a>, but maybe this is the sort of thing Substack deserves.</p>\n\n<p>The gist of his debut post is that he used ChatGPT to create a small “staff” of teammates to work with, along with photos of these personalities, and he developed a crush on his new CEO. Really.</p>\n\n<p>Do I think he’s serious? No, not at all. Do I think he wrote this to generate attention just like I’m giving him now? Yes, obviously.
