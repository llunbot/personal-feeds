Apple introduced this power management system in iOS 10.2.1, but it initially failed to mention the change in that update's release notes. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/28/apple-iphone-battery-performance-price-drop/\">Apple apologized</a> about its lack of transparency, and temporarily lowered the price of iPhone battery replacements to $29 in 2018.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite apologizing over the way it communicated the change, Apple repeatedly denied all allegations and never admitted to any legal wrongdoing. Apple said it agreed to the settlement only to \"avoid burdensome and costly litigation.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe class included any U.S. resident who owned an affected iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and/or iPhone SE that ran iOS 10.2.1 or later, and/or an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus that ran iOS 11.2 or later, before December 21, 2017. The deadline to submit a claim for a payment was in October 2020.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple continues to have a performance management system <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387\">on the iPhone 6 and newer</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Nice thing to wake up to on a Saturday morning — especially after 3.5 years of waiting! <a href=\"https://t.co/efqqgca8NG\">https://t.co/efqqgca8NG</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hqfBV25M6s\">pic.twitter.com/hqfBV25M6s</a></p>— Michael Burkhardt (@mbrkhrdt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbrkhrdt/status/1743663751146946929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 6, 2024</a></blockquote> </div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-slowdown/\">iPhone Slowdown</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/06/apple-starts-iphone-batterygate-payouts/\">Apple Starts Sending 'Batterygate' Settlement Payments to iPhone Users</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-starts-sending-batterygate-settlement-payments-to-iphone-users.2415629/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6579379e871425b443eda689549e26b72b5fb1fef0291addd856d06ae989b8e7","category":"Apple"}
