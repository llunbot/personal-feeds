Apple unveiled the Vision Pro in June 2023, and in the meantime Meta has been \"increasingly focusing on mixed reality,\" claims <em>WSJ</em>'s sources.\r<br />\n<blockquote>In addition, some developers are simplifying their apps and favor Apple’s design that allows wearers to use their eyes and fingers to control or manipulate what they see. Meta’s Quest primarily relies on the use of controllers for games or applications, although it can work with finger gestures.</blockquote>Notably, Apple has shunned Meta's digital reality vision at every opportunity. For example, Apple VP of global marketing Greg Joswiak has said that \"metaverse\" is a word he will never use.
