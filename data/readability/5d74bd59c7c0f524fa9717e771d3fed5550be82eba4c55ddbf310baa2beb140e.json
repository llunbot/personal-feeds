Gnarly Nutrition says supplemental HMB during intense exercise can help&nbsp;prevent muscle breakdown and kickstart muscle repair.</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KuwpWMzkNV0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><p>Like all Gnarly products, the Fuel2O is non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free, NSF for Sport Certified and uses only natural sweeteners and coloring. Pick it up in Limeade, Tropical, or Cherry Cola (with caffeine) flavors. A $28.95 USD box gets you 10 sticks (that’s 20 servings with 2 servings per stick). You can also get them in Singles (2 servings) for $3 USD a pop. The most eco-friendly buy is the Fuel2O Bag which contains 25 servings; this one retails at $34.95 USD. Each serving contains a claimed 100 calories, 250mg, 30mg caffeine (Cherry Cola Flavor only), as well as Calcium, Chloride, Magnesium, Potassium, and Vitamin D3 (said to maximize the efficacy of HMB).</p><div id=\"attachment_277339\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03140527/gnarly-bcaa-steel-tubs.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-277339\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03140527/gnarly-bcaa-steel-tubs.jpg\" alt=\"gnarly bcaa branched chain amino acid tin covered steel tub\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03140527/gnarly-bcaa-steel-tubs.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03140527/gnarly-bcaa-steel-tubs-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03140527/gnarly-bcaa-steel-tubs-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03140527/gnarly-bcaa-steel-tubs-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03140527/gnarly-bcaa-steel-tubs-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03140527/gnarly-bcaa-steel-tubs-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-277339\">Gnarly’s Branched Chain Amino Acid Formula comes in a Tin covered Steel tub, available in Berry Lemonade (caffeinated or regular), Fruit Punch, or Lemon Lime – pick up a 30 serving tub for $41.45 USD.</p></div><p>Not applicable to the Fuel2O product, but relevant to Gnarly’s Pre- and Post-Workout supplements is their transition to the use of tin-coated steel cans, relying less on the use of single-use plastics. The change is inspired by the fact that steel has the highest recycling rate of any material, with around 71% being repurposed compared to 8% of plastics. Gnarly’s Pre Workout and BCAA products led the transition while the Collagen Pro, Whey, and Vegan products followed later.</p><p><a href=\"https://gognarly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>GoGnarly.com</em></a></p><h2>Mantra Labs HYDRATE</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03123125/mantra-labs-hydrate-sachet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03123125/mantra-labs-hydrate-sachet.jpg\" alt=\"mantra labs hydrate sachet\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03123125/mantra-labs-hydrate-sachet.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03123125/mantra-labs-hydrate-sachet-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03123125/mantra-labs-hydrate-sachet-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03123125/mantra-labs-hydrate-sachet-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03123125/mantra-labs-hydrate-sachet-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03123125/mantra-labs-hydrate-sachet-1536x1023.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Mantra Labs has released a new zero-sugar plant-based formula of broad-spectrum electrolytes, simply named, HYDRATE. One portion of Hydrate contains zero sugar, 1,200mg of electrolytes, prebiotic fiber, Vitamins C and B12, and more than 72 trace marine minerals. Our editor, Jordan Villela got some samples in; here’s his feedback:</p><p><em>“The HYDRATE packets are very strong and condensed, they say 12+oz for each packet, but I found less than half would be good for me, and I’m used to the taste of sports drinks. The flavor (Tropical Punch) is OK but nothing crazy out of the ordinary. The vegan, paleo, etc., thing seems like a marketing deal; as a vegan, I find that most drinks are in fact… vegan.</em><br><em>I think the overwhelming taste comes from a large amount of acid in the mix, some as binders, and some as mineral enhancements. It has a great amount of nutrition but I’m a bit skeptical if it’s all-natural. The mix contains zero sugar and they use Stevia extract to make it sweeter, maybe it’s something there. I use SiS and Flow Formulas for most of my hydration needs, so maybe this is just too strong for my pallet, but when I cut down the mix, I did like it. I’m not sure if I’m getting all the benefits of the formula, though” – </em>Jordan Villela.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03122759/mantra-labs-hydrate-tub-ingredients.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03122759/mantra-labs-hydrate-tub-ingredients.jpg\" alt=\"mantra labs hydrate tub ingredients\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1074\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03122759/mantra-labs-hydrate-tub-ingredients.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03122759/mantra-labs-hydrate-tub-ingredients-297x199.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03122759/mantra-labs-hydrate-tub-ingredients-800x537.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03122759/mantra-labs-hydrate-tub-ingredients-120x81.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03122759/mantra-labs-hydrate-tub-ingredients-768x516.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03122759/mantra-labs-hydrate-tub-ingredients-1536x1031.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Mantra Labs’ new HYDRATE is available in single-serve packets and tubs, in organic no-sugar sweetened Lemonade and Fruit Punch flavors.
