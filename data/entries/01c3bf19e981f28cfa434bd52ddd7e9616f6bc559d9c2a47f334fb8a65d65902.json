{"title":"Flighty 4.0","link":"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1358823008","date":1723052461000,"content":"\n<p>Big new update to the amazing flight-tracking app, with a particular focus on flight delays — both predicting them, and explaining them. I was using Flighty 4 in beta over the weekend, when my wife and I were in Montreal for a wedding. Our flight home Sunday was delayed by thunderstorms — both in Montreal and Philadelphia — and the information from American Airlines at the airport was all over the place. The information from Flighty was consistent, and spot-on. Wound up being about a 40-minute delay, no big deal — exactly as Flighty presented.</p>\n\n<p>Flighty costs $48/year for an annual subscription, but has a super clever $4/week option for infrequent travellers. And if you don’t like subscriptions, Flighty offers fairly-priced lifetime purchases.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/07/flighty-4\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"01c3bf19e981f28cfa434bd52ddd7e9616f6bc559d9c2a47f334fb8a65d65902","category":"Tech"}
