The <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/ps3-system-software-license-agreement/\">PlayStation 3 EULA</a> was missing the \"disabling use... online or offline\" clause, but it does still warn that Sony can take steps to \"discontinue unauthorized use\" or \"prevent the use of a modified PS3 system, or any pirated material or equipment.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/why-console-makers-can-legally-brick-your-game-console/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/why-console-makers-can-legally-brick-your-game-console/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb0a073137d7ece55b7e4d863f44c5e68e3bcd92e3ce43b5ee8f6a0ec94082b0","category":"Tech"}
