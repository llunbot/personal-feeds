Or is it a viable way to combat climate change? Although beaming solar power from space to Earth could ultimately involve transmitting gigawatts, the process could be made surprisingly safe and cost-effective, according to experts from Space Solar, the European Space Agency, and the University of Glasgow.</p>\n<p>But weâ€™re going to need to move well beyond <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/headed-to-space-today-test-hardware-for-a-solar-power-plant/\">demonstration hardware</a> and solve a number of engineering challenges if we want to develop that potential.</p>\n<h2>Designing space-based solar</h2>\n<p>Beaming solar energy from space is not new; telecommunications satellites have been sending microwave signals generated by solar power back to Earth since the 1960s. But sending useful amounts of power is a different matter entirely.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037164#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037164&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d137e7f2e3f1ceca4670777d41ec804e243f993c63c0c722e12e7c590a5aa68c","category":"Tech"}
