If you've already received your new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, let us know in the comments below and make sure to share pictures and your first impressions!\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are no Apple retail locations in New Zealand, which means customers in Australia are always the first to be able to pick up new devices or purchase an ‌iPhone‌ in an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a>. Available in-store stock in Australia will provide insight into what we can expect in other Apple Stores around the world.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max models sold out during the pre-order period, and orders placed now from Apple's online store will not ship out until late October or even into November for some devices. The standard ‌iPhone 15‌ models are not as hard to come by.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you missed out on pre-orders, purchasing at an ‌Apple Store‌ or another location like Target, Walmart, or Best Buy is the only way to get a new ‌iPhone‌ on launch day. While retail stores are expected to have stock, popular ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max models could be in short supply and may sell out quickly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing New Zealand and Australia, sales and deliveries of the new ‌iPhone 15‌ models and the new Apple Watches will begin in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and finally, North America. Many Apple Stores worldwide will be opening up early at around 8:00 a.m. local time to allow customers to pick up reserved devices and make walk-in purchases.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMake sure to stay tuned to <em>MacRumors</em>, as we'll have a hands-on and unboxing tomorrow, followed by deep dives into the feature set of the new devices, camera comparisons, and more.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/iphone-15-orders-nz-australia/\">First iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Orders Arriving to Customers in Australia and New Zealand</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-orders-arriving-to-customers-in-australia-and-new-zealand.2403731/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"629e61b86c8d6157ad02d6d887c807d43b9a900ff999247cb09cd2a0b68a822c","category":"Apple"}
