With the new gestures, you can nod your head up and down, or shake it left to right, in order to answer or decline a call. Siri Interactions will also allow users to answer or dismiss calls, interact with messages, manage notifications, and more — all without speaking.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Voice Isolation</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/voice-isolation-1.jpg\" alt=\"voice\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nApple's iPhones include a calling feature that can make your voice clearer to the person you're speaking to when on a call, even when you're in a busy environment. Apple in iOS 18 is adding Voice Isolation to the ‌AirPods Pro‌ so that they also cut down on loud background sounds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen you're on a call, the mics on AirPods Pro usually pick up a wide range of sounds in the environment, like wind around the caller. But with Voice Isolation, machine learning will distinguish these sounds, block out any ambient noise, and prioritize your voice so that it comes through clearly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Personalized Spatial Audio for Gaming</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Spatial-Audio-Feature.jpg\" width=\"1698\" height=\"978\" />\r<br />\nPersonalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking will be available for gaming across AirPods (3rd generation), AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max — delivering the immersive audio customers have come to love when listening to music, or watching movies and shows. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says that when using AirPods Pro, gamers will have the best wireless audio latency it has ever delivered for mobile gaming. AirPods Pro users will also enjoy improved voice quality, including 16-bit, 48kHz audio, when chatting with teammates and other players. Game developers will also be able to incorporate spatial audio into their games for a more immersive audio experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Granular Adaptive Audio Control</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/airpods-adaptive-audio.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nApple's second-generation AirPods Pro have an Adaptive Audio feature called Adaptive Noise Control, which adjusts sound and active noise cancelation in response to changes in your environment. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nRight now, Adaptive Audio is an all or nothing setting, but that's set to change in iOS 18. Apple has added a \"Customize Adaptive Audio\" menu that lets you adjust the setting to allow for more or less noise.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Hearing Aid Mode</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/airpods-pro-noise-cancellation.jpg\" alt=\"AirPods Pro\" width=\"1212\" height=\"659\" />\r<br />\nAirPods Pro will gain a new \"hearing aid mode\" with the release of iOS 18 later this year, according to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/airpods-pro-to-gain-hearing-aid-mode-ios-18/\">March report</a> by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman. AirPods Pro already offer a Conversation Boost feature, which boosts the volume and clarity of people directly in front of the wearer, but so far Apple has not advertised the earbuds as a hearing aid device.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/ios-18-new-features-airpods-pro/\">iOS 18 to Bring These 5 New Features to AirPods Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-to-bring-these-5-new-features-to-airpods-pro.2430153/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1ed81b6814be11b7ff689a9eed5ceb38e8d8bf0628ceb6f7ae87dc5d35edc0d8","category":"Apple"}
