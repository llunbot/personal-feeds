But this podcast is much more than cyclocross talk, it’s about growing something in the sport you love. </p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<h2>Podcast Ep #107 In the CXHAIRS with Bill Schieken</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jordan sits down with Bill and chats about the inception of CXHAIRS and how it grew into the last standing real-time coverage of US Cyclocross. Bill doesn’t just cover cyclocross. However, he’s a regular fixture at the World Cup XCO mountain bike races and the US domestic off-road races. The guy loves bikes, bike racing and immersing himself in the culture that surrounds it. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-MTB-XCO--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"2048\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-MTB-XCO--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Athletes compete in the UCI US Cup MTB XC cycling race held in Fayetteville, Arkansas, USA, April 12-15, 2023.

Over the years, they have grown to have European coverage, <a href=\"https://www.cxhairsdistro.com/\">Cyclocross Television</a>, gear and moved to a <a href=\"https://cxhairs.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">substack-style model.</a> They offer deep dives into race coverage with fantastic in your face race and venue photography. Bill isn’t only a cyclocross correspondent king; he was also once part of Trek Factory Racing. He discusses his favorite times documenting the team and shares stories of hanging with the athletes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Slinging-Mud--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"2048\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Slinging-Mud--scaled.webp\" alt=\"(Photo By Bill Schieken/CXHAIRS Media)\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Slinging-Mud--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Slinging-Mud--297x238.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Slinging-Mud--1536x1229.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Slinging-Mud--120x96.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Slinging-Mud--768x614.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Slinging-Mud--2048x1638.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo By Bill Schieken/CXHAIRS Media)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>CXD Trek Bikes </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another venture that spun off the CXHAIRS’s original crew is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cxdtrekbikes/\">CXD Trek Bikes Racing</a>. CXD is a team that fosters young athletes, and gives them a propper run at cyclocross greatness. The team has evolved of the years, chaining from a CX-Devo to a full on<a href=\"https://racing.trekbikes.com/stories/regional-teams/cxhairs-devo-proves-theres-a-bright-future-for-american-cyclocross\"> elite team</a>. CXD recently claimed their first mens elite national champion in cyclocross with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/usacycling/reel/DDk2rZ_Ok4S/\">Andrew Strohmeyer </a>(pictured above in his new stars and stripes party suit). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>SVENNESS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion moves into how<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4e4oUM9ZvA\" target=\"_blank\"> SVENNESS</a> came about. Bill chats about how seeing Sven Nys ride a particular section of course over and over cemented the idea. The short and sweet “moment of SVENNESS” clips grew and eventually came part of the cyclocross vernacular – even mentioned on live Belgian TV.  There are rumors that we might see some new episodes of SVENNESS with Svens son (and newly crown Belgian Champ) Thibau Nys.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Venue--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"2048\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Venue--scaled.webp\" alt=\"CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Venue--scaled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Venue--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Venue--297x238.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Venue--1536x1229.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Venue--120x96.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Venue--768x614.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Venue--2048x1638.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo By Bill Schieken/CXHAIRS Media)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are LOTS packed into this episode, so if you’re a fan of racing in parking garages (<a href=\"https://www.bikereg.com/68257\">Garage Racing National Championship</a>), basketball (you heard that correctly), DCCX (the new Pan-American Cyclocross Championship), and all things for the love of bikes — this is a must-listen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can check out Bill Schieken on his own podcast at <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/cyclocross-radio/id1037733996\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclocross Radio</a> more of their content on the <a href=\"https://wideanglepodium.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wide Angle Podium Network</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Short-.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Short-.webp\" alt=\"CXHAIRS Bill Schieken Podcast Short\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Short-.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Short--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Short--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Short--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Short--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Short--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CXHAIRS-Bill-Schieken-Podcast-Short--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo credit: Bill Schieken</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Want More?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Find every episode of the BikeRumor Podcast on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bikerumor-podcast/id1455519558\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6CJD6UAmN9OHfttF4e9lx1\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.podbean.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Podbean</a> and more.
