The company has released <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213841\">iOS/iPadOS 16.6</a> and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213843\">macOS 13.5</a> to fix several \"actively exploited\" security bugs, plus a handful of other security fixes for problems that have been reported to Apple but aren't being exploited in the wild yet. The release notes also mention unspecified \"bug fixes\" for each OS.</p>\n\n<p>The new updates don't add anything by way of new featuresâ€”at least, there aren't any mentioned in the release notes. This will likely be the case for most iOS 16 and macOS 13 Ventura updates going forward, as Apple shifts its focus to newer operating systems. The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/apples-ios-17-with-focus-on-communication-sharing-and-intelligent-input/\">iOS/iPadOS 17</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/macos-sonoma-is-the-next-release-of-macos-coming-this-fall/\">macOS 14 Sonoma</a> updates should be available in September or October, if Apple sticks to its historical release schedule. The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/apple-releases-first-public-betas-of-ios-17-macos-14-sonoma-and-other-new-oses/\">public betas were released</a> earlier this month.</p>\n<p>Several of the security fixes in these updates were originally part of a Rapid Response security update for iOS 16.5.1 and macOS 13.4.1. The original version of that update <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/07/apple-releases-quickly-pulls-rapid-security-response-update-for-0-day-webkit-bug/\">was pulled post-release</a> after it broke a few major websites on devices that installed it, but a working version with the same fixes was released soon after.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956192#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956192&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a20669fda294e2d4851eaf3ae3c301c7acdfda2827c18c13c65eb3572831658e","category":"Tech"}
