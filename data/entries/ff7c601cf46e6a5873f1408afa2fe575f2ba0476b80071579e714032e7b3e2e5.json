Chevy has been pitching the Equinox EV as affordable, originally with a starting price of just under $30,000. That gave the automaker the cover it needed <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/gm-confirms-chevy-bolt-will-die-this-year-making-way-for-electric-pickups/\">to kill off its affordable EV</a>, the Bolt, an act of corporate ax-swinging that looked even more cruel when it emerged that the electric Equinox would start at $34,995.</p>\n<p>At least, if you want—or can even find—the 1LT base model. Now, Chevrolet has finally released pricing for the other trim levels, and there's a steep jump from the bare bones 1LT even to the 2LT, which will cost $43,295. That $8,300 buys some conveniences like heated and power-adjustable front seats, heated side mirrors, and a powered rear liftgate, as well as some styling tweaks. Adaptive cruise control and Super Cruise are also available, but only as cost options.</p>\n<p>Early adopters won't actually be able to buy either of those because Chevy is starting with the 2RS as the initial trim level when the car goes on sale later this year. The 2RS starts at $44,795 and is a slightly sportier take on the Equinox than the 2LT, albeit with much the same standard features and options.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002851#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002851&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
