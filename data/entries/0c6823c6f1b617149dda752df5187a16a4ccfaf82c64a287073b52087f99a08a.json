Whether it’s logging into Amazon to order a new book, checking your online banking or settling down to watch something on Netflix, seeing the log-in box appear can make your heart sink. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s the fact that each site seems to require a different length or combination of certain characters, meaning you need different ones for nearly every site or service (which, sadly, is also a good idea). How are our limited human brains supposed to store all these weird strings of letters, numbers and special characters? All I want to do is stream Star Trek: The Next Generation for the 50th time, not prove my intellectual prowess! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Password managers can help you manage all your passwords and login information across your Mac, iPhone, iPad and other Apple devices. Apple offers iCloud Keychain, but is that the best password manager for Mac and iPhone, or is there another password manager for Apple devices that would do a better job.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><p>PROMOTION</p><p><strong>RoboForm Premium: Just $0.99/Month!</strong></p></div><div><div><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Desktop-Light-1.png?w=1240&amp;h=697&amp;crop=1\" loading=\"lazy\" /></div><p>\n</p><p>Secure your passwords with RoboForm Premium—now only $0.99/month, a massive 60% off!

They even make recommendations for really secure passwords, so you don’t rely on the mixture of your birthday and the name of your first pet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having only a single login to remember? That sounds good to us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need some help coming up with a safe and secure password? Read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1807351/create-safe-password-tips.html\">tips to make your passwords even stronger</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Updated July 2024 to add Roboform review. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How password managers work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of password managers is to simplify the way you access your various accounts. Instead of having to memorize multiple complex passwords for each of the services you use you need only recall one password – or provide a fingerprint or Face ID – and the password manager will automatically fill in the required details for you. Just remember this is only as safe as the password you use to unlock access to all your passwords – so don’t lock them all behind an easy-to-guess password, like your pet’s name.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The password managers also offer various other features. For example, they can generate random, highly secure passwords for your accounts, they can warn you if your password has been compromised, and some can advise you about existing insecure passwords and support your efforts to update them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, security is a high priority—as the manager apps have the virtual keys to your kingdom—which is why all of the options listed below use high-grade encryption to protect your details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many also feature digital wallets so your bank details can be safely stored and used to make purchases online without having to root around in your pocket or bag for the card number and expiry date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These services don’t usually come for free, but many offer trials so you can see if it’s the solution for you. After that you’ll need to pay a small monthly fee, but we think that’s a price worth paying for only having to keep one password in your brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do you need a password manager? Is iCloud Keychain enough? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But do you need to buy a password manager when there is one in macOS, iOS and iPadOS? Apple provides iCloud Keychain, which will generate secure passwords and enter them for you automatically, all while storing them securely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>iCloud Keychain is incredibly useful, but it’s a bit basic and lacks some of the features offered by other password managers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you want to stay safe without having to recall hundreds of passwords, but want more control and features than you get from Apple’s free offering, here’s some of the best alternatives available for Mac, iPhone and iPad users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more ways to keep your data safe be sure to also read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1432223/mac-security-tips-password-find-my-users-lockdown-mode.html\">Best Mac security tips</a> article.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Password Managers for Mac and iPhone</h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiCloud Keychain – Best For Basics \t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"iCloud Keychain - Best For Basics \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/iCloud-Keychain-Review-MAIN.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"iCloud Keychain - Best For Basics \" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"iCloud Keychain - Best For Basics \" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPart of iCloud: Free on 5GB plan \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.icloud.com&amp;xcust=1-1-668938-6-664849-9934&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Free at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>iCloud Keychain is Apple’s free password management system and is built into macOS, iOS and all other Apple platforms. With the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS Sequoia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a> in late 2024 the iCloud Keychain will be transformed into a separate app, which should make managing passwords even easier, or at any rate should lead more people to discover its capabilities. </p>\n\n<p>Right now, iCloud Keychain helps you to create secure passwords, warns you if you reuse one or if a password is not secure, then auto-fills your passwords when needed. Plus everything is encrypted, so it’s safe and secure.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not just for passwords though, as it can also store your credit card numbers and address details. This means you can go to sites, choose the item you want to buy, then complete the transaction in seconds and without needing to dredge your memory or fill in loads of text boxes first.</p>\n\n<p>There’s no dedicated iCloud Keychain app, so you need to go and find it in the Settings of your iPhone or Mac. Because of this, the experience is not quite as polished as with some of the other offerings on this list.  It’s also pretty much only for Apple devices. True there’s the iCloud Passwords app and extensions for Windows and Android, but it’s not quite as seamless as on your iPhone, iPad and Mac. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2317973/icloud-keychain-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiCloud Keychain review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1Password – Best Password Manager \t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"1Password - Best Password Manager \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1Password-Watchtower.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"1Password - Best Password Manager \" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"1Password - Best Password Manager \" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t14 day trial.

It also uses the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol, which allows you to authenticate your details to a site without the information being sent to a server which could compromise security.</p>\n\n<p>A feature called Watchtower analyzes the overall strength of your online security and warns you if passwords are repeated or vulnerable. There’s also a password generator if you want to replace your tired old attempts with something a bit more secure.  </p>\n\n<p>A free 14-day trial is available, but after that, you’ll need to move on to a paid subscription that starts at $36 (approx £29) per year.

Oh, and you can sync all your devices, rather than the single one offered by most other free tiers. </p>\n\n<p>Should you want to expand the features, then the Premium tier costs $10 (approx £8) per year and adds secure file sharing, 1GB of encrypted file attachments, additional two-factor authentication options, password safety analysis, and access to your account by family if you die or become sick. </p>\n\n<p>Encryption is high-grade stuff, with Bitwarden deploying end-to-end AES-256 bit encryption, salted hashing, and PBKDF2 SHA-256, all of which are down locally on your machine. </p>\n\n<p>Apps are available on a wide range of platforms, including macOS, Windows, Linux, pretty much every browser you can think of, Android, and iOS, and there’s even a secure web version if you find yourself without your device. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re looking for value when it comes to password managers, it’s very hard to look past Bitwarden. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNordPass – Easy To Use Password Manager \t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"NordPass - Easy To Use Password Manager \" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3780912/best_password_manager_for_mac_nord.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"NordPass - Easy To Use Password Manager \" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"NordPass - Easy To Use Password Manager \" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFree 30-day trial; $2.99 per month (currently $1.49), $35.88 a year (currently $35.76 for two years)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.nordpass.io/aff_c?offer_id=488&amp;aff_id=980&amp;url_id=9356&amp;aff_sub=1-1-668938-6-662535-17978\" target=\"_blank\">$35.76 at  NordPass (first two years)</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>One of the newest additions to the password manager arena is <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://nordpass.com&amp;xcust=1-1-668938-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">NordPass</a>, which is made by the same fine fellows at <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://nordvpn.com&amp;xcust=1-1-668938-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">NordVPN</a>.

You can also use NordPass through browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave, Edge, and Safari. </p>\n\n<p>NordPass has all the features you’d expect from a modern password manager, with quick importing of existing passwords from other services, zero-knowledge architecture, local encryption, 2-factor authentication, password generation, and secure storage for credit details and notes. There’s of course autofill for logging into accounts, folders to store passwords for work, home or other classifications, security monitoring for password hacks, support for biometrics, plus a neat interface to manage all of your various data.</p>\n\n<p>NordPass offers a decent free tier, which supports unlimited passwords, stores credit card details, and secure notes, plus has the ability to sync across all your devices. The main drawback is that you can only be logged into one device at a time. But if you can work with that it’s a service you should definitely investigate.

Download the relevant app or extension, then sign up for an account. There’s a free trial that gives you access to the Premium tier features for 14-days, then you can either continue to use it for free on the limited tier or sign up to a fully-functional paid variety.</p>\n\n<p>As well as passwords you can store personal details (e.g. address and phone number), your passport, driving license and other sensitive data. You can import your existing login details from other services or your browser.</p>\n\n<p>The Mac interface is a little basic–the desktop client looks like a Finder window. On iPhone, the main page has buttons along the bottom that allow you to navigate between Identity (passport, etc.), the built-in Browser, Authenticator, Tools section, secure share, and Emergency Access feature (for family, should something happen to you).</p>\n\n<p>The browser version features Roboform’s one-click login where you select the site from your logins or history that you want to access and Roboform opens the page and automatically log into your account. Most people will probably stick with their normal browser, in which case Roboform acts like any other password manager, prompting you with stored account details when you attempt to login.</p>\n\n<p>The password generator does a good job of helping you choose new passwords. You can select the number of characters, numbers, symbols, upper or lower case, and create passphrases.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a built-in authenticator and Roboform can handle two-factor authentication. You can also use passkeys instead of passwords.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a Security Centre that analyses your password integrity. This includes how many times you’ve used the same ones, how complex they are, and if they’ve been involved in hacks. Everything you do is end-to-end encrypted via AES 256-bit encryption, with PBKDF2 SHA256.</p>\n\n<p>Roboform offers a limited free tier (one device with unlimited passwords). The Premium tier (which used to be called Roboform Everywhere), adds the security center, access on all your devices, customer support, and web access to your account.

This recent history makes it harder to recommend. </p>\n\n<p>Not that security measures aren’t there, the company explains that it uses “AES 256-bit encryption with PBKDF2 SHA-256 and salted hashes to ensure complete security in the cloud.” The app does all of its encryption locally, so LastPass never knows your master password, and the Premium tier also supports a form of two-factor authentication for another layer of security. </p>\n\n<p>You can either use LastPass locally on your device via dedicated apps (macOS, iOS and iPadOS), or via the web with plugins and extensions available for Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Microsoft Edge all of which allow you to automatically access login details for sites and accounts or have LastPass autofill the login fields on your behalf. </p>\n\n<p>Just like with other managers you have access to a vault where all of your passwords are stored, and these can be changed to more complex alternatives at the touch of a button. LastPass will also advise you on how secure your passwords are for your existing accounts. Getting set up is easy too, as you can import existing passwords from web browsers, email, and other password managers. One drawback is that, at the time of writing, LastPass doesn’t yet support Passkeys, although the company says that the features is on its way. </p>\n\n<p>The app offers a digital wallet to store your card details, plus another area for official ID such as passports and driving licenses. The Note section is a place where you can keep Wi-Fi passwords, insurance details and any other important documents that you need to access. It’s also possible to securely share account details and logins with friends and family, even if they don’t have LastPass. </p>\n\n<p>There is a free tier, although this is limited to one device, so if you want to sync across your Mac and iPhone you’ll need to move up to the Premium tier. At the time of writing, this will cost $36/£31.99 per year. Those wanting more scope can opt for the family plan which includes six user accounts and only costs $48/£40.80 per year.</p>\n\n<p>One of the advantages of a paid plan is an Emergency backup which means that, should you suffer an accident or even pass away, your family will be given access to your account.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2281756/lastpass-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLastPass review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnpass\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"Enpass\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Best-password-manager-ENPASS-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"Enpass\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"Enpass\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFree tier; From $1.99 per month, $23.99 a year\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.enpass.io&amp;xcust=1-1-668938-6-659873-19120&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$23.99 at  Enpass (annually)</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Those looking for a simple, secure solution that doesn’t break the bank would do well to consider Enpass.</p>\n\n<p>The macOS client is completely free, but if you want to add the same features to your iPhone or Android device then you’ll need to move to the Enpass Premium tier that costs $23.99/£19.49 per year.
