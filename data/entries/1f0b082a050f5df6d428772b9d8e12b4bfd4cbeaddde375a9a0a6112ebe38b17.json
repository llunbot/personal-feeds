But there are just as many new products being launched in tandem with the event. Case in point, IRC just launched seven new tires in its booth at the Unbound Expo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IRC is one of many sponsors of this year’s Unbound Gravel, and they invited everyone to join them at their booth on Thursday afternoon to get a special first look at the new tires and enjoy a cool beverage. Unfortunately, we weren’t there to check out the tires or enjoy a cool beverage in person, but we do have the details on the new additions to IRC’s lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New IRC Gravel Tires</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As expected at the world’s biggest gravel event, four of the new models are gravel tires. In line with modern trends, two of the new models, the Boken G-Claw and Boken Pro, are on the wider side of the spectrum. The new Boken Doublecross Light and Boken Light are based on existing models in the lineup, but with lighter constructions and tan walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there’s no bigger stage to demonstrate the performance of the new gravel tires than racing at Unbound. IRC athlete Pete Stetina will be tackling the course on some of the new tires. According to Pete’s mechanic, Big Tall Wayne, he’ll be running the new, fast-rolling Boken Pro 700x47c front and rear, but might opt for the Boken G-Claw on the front, depending on mud conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Boken G-Claw 700x50c</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/g-claw-new-unbound_2048x.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/g-claw-new-unbound_2048x.webp\" alt=\"Stock image of the new IRC Boken G-Claw gravel tire.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/g-claw-new-unbound_2048x.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/g-claw-new-unbound_2048x-297x188.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/g-claw-new-unbound_2048x-120x76.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/g-claw-new-unbound_2048x-768x487.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With gravel tires trending wider at an alarming rate, the new Boken G-Claw is a timely addition to IRC’s lineup, which previously maxed out at 42c. IRC calls it “the ultimate crossover tire engineered for riders who demand speed, grip, and durability across any terrain.” And given that the latest trend in gravel tires is XC tires, it’s not too surprising that it looks a lot like a very low-profile mountain bike tire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to IRC, the Boken G-Claw “seamlessly blends the speed of a gravel tire with the tenacious grip of an XC mountain bike tire.” Based on the tread design, it looks like it should provide plenty of grip, but IRC says the low-profile center tread minimizes rolling resistance. It seems like it could be a great option for riders who spend the majority of their time riding rough surfaces and/or loose conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The G-Claw comes in a 700x50c size only with a 120 TPI casing, reinforced sidewalls, and a high-grip rubber compound. It has a claimed weight of 610 grams and retails for $65.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Boken Pro 700x47c</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-bokenPro-SIDE-front_8b4c3055-cb3c-4baf-a259-e07294b61faf_1520x.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"977\" height=\"604\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-bokenPro-SIDE-front_8b4c3055-cb3c-4baf-a259-e07294b61faf_1520x.webp\" alt=\"stock image of the new IRC Boken Pro gravel tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-bokenPro-SIDE-front_8b4c3055-cb3c-4baf-a259-e07294b61faf_1520x.webp 977w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-bokenPro-SIDE-front_8b4c3055-cb3c-4baf-a259-e07294b61faf_1520x-297x184.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-bokenPro-SIDE-front_8b4c3055-cb3c-4baf-a259-e07294b61faf_1520x-120x74.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-bokenPro-SIDE-front_8b4c3055-cb3c-4baf-a259-e07294b61faf_1520x-768x475.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another tire adding width to IRC’s lineup is the new Boken Pro 700x47c. Unlike the G-Claw described above, this plump tire has a perfectly smooth center tread flanked by moderate-height shoulder knobs. That center tread looks to be very fast-rolling, and IRC says, “This tire blends speed, durability, and comfort to deliver exceptional performance on mixed terrain.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on looks alone, the Boken Pro appears to be a great new option for smooth gravel or mixed terrain rides that include equal parts paved and unpaved roads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Boken Pro comes in a 700c47c size only with tan walls, a 120 TPI casing, and is hookless compatible. It has a claimed weight of 510 grams and a retail price of $65.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Boken Doublecross Light TLR</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/dc-light-new_2048x.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/dc-light-new_2048x.webp\" alt=\"stock image if the new IRC Boken Doublecross Light gravel tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/dc-light-new_2048x.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/dc-light-new_2048x-297x188.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/dc-light-new_2048x-120x76.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/dc-light-new_2048x-768x487.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who haven’t gotten on board the wider-is-better train might want to check out the new Boken Doublecross Light. IRC calls it “the ultimate gravel and adventure tire.” With a design based on the existing Doublecross tire, the Doublecross Light isn’t entirely new, but it gets a lighter casing and tanwalls. The tightly packed center tread and aggressive side knobs looks to combine rolling efficiency and cornering grip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IRC claims the new 120 TPI casing reduces weight by 9% while reducing rolling resistance. The sidewalls are reinforced and feature a “puncture-resistant belt” to protect against pinch flats, punctures, and cuts. The Doublecross Light uses the Boken High Grip rubber compound and comes with tan sidewalls. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the regular Doublecross, the Doublecross Light comes in 700x38c and 700x42c sizes. The 38c weighs a claimed 470 grams, while the 42c comes in at 505 grams. They retail for $65.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Boken Light TLR</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/boken-light-new_2048x.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/boken-light-new_2048x.webp\" alt=\"stock image of the IRC Boken Light gravel tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/boken-light-new_2048x.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/boken-light-new_2048x-297x188.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/boken-light-new_2048x-120x76.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/boken-light-new_2048x-768x487.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the Doublecross Light, the Boken Light is a lighter version of the existing Boken tire. The Boken is IRC’s file-tread tire, with a low-profile diamond tread pattern covering the majority of it. That’s bordered by a row of larger side knobs for a little cornering bite. Like other file-tread tires, the emphasis is on versatility and low rolling resistance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new light, 120 TPI casing results in a claimed 9% weight reduction and increased suppleness, which should help improve grip and rider comfort. IRC also included a puncture-resistant belt to the sidewalls to help reduce the chances of flats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Boken Light comes with classic tanwalls and is available in 700x36c and 700x40c sizes. Claimed weights are 430 grams in the 36c size and 460 grams in the 40c size. They retail for $65.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New IRC Road Tires</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While not quite as relevant to Unbound, IRC also launched three new road tire models. With the “revolutionary” 6th generation Formula Pro Series, the brand claims “an astonishing 80% increase in tire lifespan and a significant 9.97% reduction in rolling resistance, thanks to IRC’s innovative new compound and tread design.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Formula Pro Series consists of three models: the Formula Pro TL RBCC, Formula Pro TL X-Guard, and Formula Pro Tubeless Ready S-Light. All three models share the same tread design and come in four widths, but each brings slightly different performance attributes to the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Formula Pro TL RBCC</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6Gfp_slight01_2color_2048x.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6Gfp_slight01_2color_2048x.webp\" alt=\"stock image of the new IRC Formula Pro TL RBCC tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6Gfp_slight01_2color_2048x.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6Gfp_slight01_2color_2048x-297x149.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6Gfp_slight01_2color_2048x-120x60.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6Gfp_slight01_2color_2048x-768x384.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>IRC claims the new RBCC is the fastest tubeless tire in its history. With a 9.97% reduction in rolling resistance compared to its predecessor, it certainly sounds pretty speedy. Thanks to IRC’s RBCC technology and tread enhanced with RB ceramic particles from rice bran, it also offers a claimed “82% improvement in wear resistance.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Formula Pro TL RBCC has a 180 TPI casing and is compatible with hooked and hookless rims. IRC claims it is a true tubeless design that doesn’t require sealant. It comes in four widths, 700x25c, 28c, 30c, and 32c, in black and tan sidewalls. Weights range from 270 grams (25c) to 360 grams (32c).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Formula Pro TLR S-Light</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/for-gen6-super-lights_679ea62a-c4b8-4db3-a6ff-a579b90ba2ca_1520x.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/for-gen6-super-lights_679ea62a-c4b8-4db3-a6ff-a579b90ba2ca_1520x.webp\" alt=\"stock image of the IRC Formula Pro TLR S-Light tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/for-gen6-super-lights_679ea62a-c4b8-4db3-a6ff-a579b90ba2ca_1520x.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/for-gen6-super-lights_679ea62a-c4b8-4db3-a6ff-a579b90ba2ca_1520x-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/for-gen6-super-lights_679ea62a-c4b8-4db3-a6ff-a579b90ba2ca_1520x-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/for-gen6-super-lights_679ea62a-c4b8-4db3-a6ff-a579b90ba2ca_1520x-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>IRC put “light” in the name because they want you to know the new S-Light is one of the lightest tubeless-ready tires around. They may look identical to the RBCC, but they are notably lighter, with claimed weights between 50 and 60 grams lighter, depending on the size. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the RBCC, the S-Light has a 180 TPI casing and is compatible with hooked and hookless rims, although it does require sealant. It comes with either black or tan sidewalls, and is available in 700x25c, 28c, 30c, and 32c widths. With claimed weights ranging between 220 grams in 25c and 300 grams in 32c, these are some light tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Formula Pro Tubeless X-Guard</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/for-gen6-x-guard_84ee89af-d7ff-49c3-b193-6165f9a2dd29_760x.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"760\" height=\"456\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/for-gen6-x-guard_84ee89af-d7ff-49c3-b193-6165f9a2dd29_760x.webp\" alt=\"Stock image of the new iRC Formula Pro Tubeless X-Guard tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/for-gen6-x-guard_84ee89af-d7ff-49c3-b193-6165f9a2dd29_760x.webp 760w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/for-gen6-x-guard_84ee89af-d7ff-49c3-b193-6165f9a2dd29_760x-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/for-gen6-x-guard_84ee89af-d7ff-49c3-b193-6165f9a2dd29_760x-120x72.webp 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new X-Guard adds extra protection to provide more puncture resistance and durability. IRC says you can ride more and worry less because the X-Guard is the “ultimate tubeless tire that eliminates the sealant hassle and delivers unparalleled puncture protection.” This is achieved through the addition of IRC’s Puncture-Resistant Belt X-Guard for an extra layer of flat protection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the other models in the new Formula Pro Series, the X-Guard has a 180 TPI casing and is compatible with hooked and hookless rims. It comes in the same four sizes, 700x25c, 28c, 30c, and 32c. The X-Guard puncture protection adds a touch of weight, with claimed weights ranging from 305 grams in the 25c size up to 405 grams in the 32c width.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the new gravel tires are available now through the IRC website. The new road tires are listed on the site, but don’t appear to be available to purchase just yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://ircbike.com/\">ircbike.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/irc-tire-launches-seven-new-tires-at-unbound/\">IRC Tire Launches Seven New Tires At Unbound</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1f0b082a050f5df6d428772b9d8e12b4bfd4cbeaddde375a9a0a6112ebe38b17","category":"Cycling"}
