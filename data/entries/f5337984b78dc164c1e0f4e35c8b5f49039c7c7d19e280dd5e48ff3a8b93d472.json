According to the survey, which involved more than 13,500 teens across 47 states, 87% of respondents said they own an ‌iPhone‌. Additionally, 88% of teens expect their next smartphone to be an ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe data also highlights a marginal decrease in the number of teens planning to upgrade to the ‌iPhone 16‌. About 22% of respondents said they intend to upgrade this fall or winter, which is a slight drop from the 23% who planned to upgrade to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> at the same time last year, and from the 24% for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> in 2022. The decrease suggests a growing trend of teens holding onto their iPhones for longer periods before upgrading, with the average ‌iPhone‌ now being three generations behind the ‌iPhone 16‌. This is a notable shift from two years ago, when the average gap was only 2.5 generations. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite the slight decline in immediate upgrade plans, a significant driver of future purchases appears to be Apple's forthcoming suite of AI features. Nearly 30% of surveyed teens indicated that they plan to upgrade their devices because of Apple Intelligence, which Apple plans to roll out starting later this year. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to iPhones, other Apple products remain popular among teens. AirPods continue to be a major hit, with about 70% of respondents reporting ownership of a pair. The report also noted that 25% of teens expect to purchase new AirPods in the next six months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, ownership of other Apple devices including iPads and Apple Watches, is also strong, with more than 30% of teens saying they own each of these products. However, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>+ appears to have less traction, as only 10% of teens reported using the service, and they spend only about 1% of their total media consumption time on ‌Apple TV‌+. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, on the other hand, has maintained a steady presence among teens, with approximately one-third of respondents saying they have access to the service. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/piper-jaffray/\">Piper Jaffray</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/iphone-16-demand-dips-among-teens/\">iPhone 16 Demand Dips Among Teens, But Interest in Apple Intelligence Could Still Spur Upgrades</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-demand-dips-among-teens-but-interest-in-apple-intelligence-could-still-spur-upgrades.2439631/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f5337984b78dc164c1e0f4e35c8b5f49039c7c7d19e280dd5e48ff3a8b93d472","category":"Apple"}
