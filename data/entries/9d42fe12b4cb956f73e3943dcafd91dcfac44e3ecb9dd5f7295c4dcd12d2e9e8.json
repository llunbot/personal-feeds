Below we list the best Black Friday deals on some of these docks and hubs that we have recommended as the best of the best in our reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of great deals include the iVanky FusionDock Max 1 (uniquely boasting two Thunderbolt 4 chips), the Wavlink Thunderbolt 4 Triple Display Docking Station (our favorite budget Thunderbolt 4 dock), the Satechi Dual Dock Stand (our best choice for Mac USB-C dock) and the CalDigit TS4 (the most powerful Thunderbolt 4 dock in our tests), as well as super hubs such as the Baseus 10Gbps USB-C Hub with 50% off its retail price. The Anker 675 is a combination monitor stand and fast USB-C dock, and has a third slashed from its MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the official Black Friday is on November 29 and Cyber Monday on December 2, we’re already seeing fantastic deals, so you might not want to wait. We’ll be updating this page regularly as more discounts come in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Amazon deals are for Prime subscribers only, so, you need to have a subscription to the service (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime\" target=\"_blank\">$14.99</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/amazonprime\" target=\"_blank\">£8.99</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/amazonprime\" target=\"_blank\">CA$9.99</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/prime\" target=\"_blank\">AU$9.99</a> per month or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime#PricingModuleAnchor\" target=\"_blank\">$139</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/amazonprime#PricingModuleAnchor\" target=\"_blank\">£95</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/amazonprime\" target=\"_blank\">CA$99</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/prime#\" target=\"_blank\">AU$79</a> per year). You can sign up for the 30-day free trial to cover the Prime-only deals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are many deals available when a subscription to Prime is not necessary and anyone can enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Want to see how much you can save on Apple products?
