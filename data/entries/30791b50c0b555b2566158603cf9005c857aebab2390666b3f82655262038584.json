The return to Le Mans also signals the marque joining the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) and the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship.</p>\n<p>Often talked about in hushed tones by people in the know, the idea of Aston Martin's halo hypercar entering the top flight of endurance motorsport has long been wished for, and the firm's announcement is sure to make race fans happy. The Gaydon, UK, company intends to enter at least one Valkyrie in both WEC and IMSA from 2025, giving itself a chance to take the top step at Le Mans, the Rolex 24 at Daytona, and the 12 Hours of Sebring.</p>\n<p>The basis for the competition car is set to be <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/03/a-hybrid-bentley-and-million-dollar-track-cars-wow-at-the-geneva-motor-show/\">the Aston Martin Valkyrie AMR Pro</a>, an even more hardcore version of the already rather raucous Valkyrie road car. The car with license plates boasts <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/12/12-cylinders-11000rpm-aston-martins-new-engine-is-a-monster/\">a Cosworth-developed 6.5-liter V12 packing</a> 1,000 hp (745 kW), mated to a 160 hp (120 kW) electric motor, giving it an F1-style kinetic energy recovery system. Its hybrid setup makes it a ferocious thing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973144#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973144&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"30791b50c0b555b2566158603cf9005c857aebab2390666b3f82655262038584","category":"Tech"}
