The problem lasted for about 45 minutes or so.</p>\n<p>In our tests, clicking any link brought up this error message:</p>\n<blockquote><p>{\"errors\":[{\"message\":\"Your current API plan does not include access to this endpoint, please see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api for more information\",\"code\":467}]}</p></blockquote>\n<p>Clicking that developer link didn't clear anything up while the problem was still happening because it brought up the same API error message. In addition to news articles and other outbound links, the error message appeared when we tried to click Twitter's terms of service, privacy policy, cookie policy, and other similar pages. Some images embedded in tweets were broken, and there were reports of TweetDeck being broken too.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922014#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922014&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c6ebc4b728c541a7ca94e512d37001558dc4d7da8167bcc7db9a50cfc3d23056","category":"Tech"}
