{"title":"Croissant 1.0","link":"https://aaron.vegh.ca/2024/10/say-hello-to-croissant","date":1728335117000,"content":"\n<p>Aaron Vegh and <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@BenRiceM/113232525012383457\">Ben Rice McCarthy</a> (of <a href=\"https://obscura.camera/obscura/index.html\">Obscura</a> renown) have teamed up to create <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/croissant-cross-posting/id6670288979\">Croissant</a>, a new app — currently iPhone-only — for cross-posting to Mastodon, Threads, and Bluesky. 15 years ago I wrote “Twitter Clients Are a UI Design Playground” and that piece stands up, but it’s not Twitter/X in particular (certainly not anymore — X support is conspicuously omitted from Croissant’s current lineup up supported platforms), but tweet-like platforms in general. Croissant proves that this domain remains a UI playground. It’s both visually distinctive and intuitively familiar, with a fun and fluid UI. It’s the sort of app that I want to find reasons to use.</p>\n\n<p>Free to download and try with a single account; $3/month, $20/year, or $60 as a one-time purchase for multi-account support, which is where Croissant really shines.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/10/croissant-simplifies-social-media-cross-posting-on-ios/\">Dan Moren at Six Colors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/croissant-a-beautifully-designed-app-for-cross-posting-to-multiple-social-media-accounts/\">John Voorhees at MacStories</a>, and <a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/croissant/\">Nick Heer at Pixel Envy</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/07/croissant\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"91b944e443ef7ea561bc1c179e99c157d9015a82151d1ae2f3daf88748d56968","category":"Tech"}
