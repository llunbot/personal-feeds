The Paralympics is over for another four years but the memories from these Games will last a lifetime. In total, Great Britain won 22 medals in cycling, a mix of gold, silver and bronze placing them third in the sportâ€™s medal table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are five of the best moments.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Sarah Storey wins incredible 19<sup>th</sup> gold medal</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>Dame Sarah Storey has never lost in cycling at the Paralympics.<br /><br />Just let that sink in.<br /><br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f947.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥‡\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f947.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥‡\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f947.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥‡\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f947.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥‡\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f947.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥‡\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f947.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥‡\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f947.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥‡\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f947.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥‡\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f947.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥‡\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f947.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥‡\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f947.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥‡\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f947.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥‡\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f947.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥‡\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f947.png\" alt=\"ðŸ¥‡\" /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Paris2024?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#Paris2024</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Paralympics?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#Paralympics</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAmLimitless?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#IAmLimitless</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5PlJoZf3Lh\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/5PlJoZf3Lh</a></p>â€” British Cycling (@BritishCycling) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BritishCycling/status/1832027668415394199?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">September 6, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Storey, the most decorated British Paralympian, notched her 19th gold medal with victory in cyclingâ€™s C4-5 road race. It was the 30th medal of her career, and came just two days after winning a gold medal in the C5 road time-trial. The 46-year-old pipped Franceâ€™s Heidi Gaugain to the line and described the Paralympics as a â€˜whirlwindâ€™.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Storeyâ€™s Paralympic career stretches back to the 1992 Barcelona Games. Then, as a 14-year-old swimmer, she won two gold medals before adding another three in the pool at Atlanta 1996. She transitioned to cycling and won her first Paralympic gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games in the time-trial and individual pursuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her dominance continued throughout her home Paralympics at London 2012, where she claimed a further four gold medals. At Rio 2016, Storey was victorious in the individual pursuit, time-trial and road race, going on to defend her titles in these events at Tokyo 2020. And sheâ€™s yet to rule out LA 2028â€¦</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-cycling-moments-2024-paris-olympics\">The best cycling moments from the 2024 Paris Olympics</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/olympics-add-cycling-events\">The Olympics needs to add these five cycling events</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/handcycling-hill-climb\">Meet the handcyclist whoâ€™s been tackling Britainâ€™s toughest hill climbs</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/dame-sarah-storey-profile\">Neverending Storey: Why Dame Sarah isnâ€™t slowing down yet</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Archie Atkinson wins silver medal and hearts worldwide</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Archie-Atkinson-970x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Archie-Atkinson-970x970.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Archie-Atkinson-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Archie-Atkinson-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Archie-Atkinson-768x768.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Archie-Atkinson-75x75.jpg 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Archie-Atkinson-350x350.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Archie-Atkinson-750x750.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Archie-Atkinson.jpg 1080w\" /><figcaption>British Cycling</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>From an experienced Paralympian to one making their debut. 20-year-old Archie Atkinson lit the track on fire in Paris, setting a world record with a time of 4min 17.7sec during the menâ€™s C4 pursuit qualifying. He was set to win the gold medal against Slovakiaâ€™s Jozef Metelka but crashed just before he could make the catch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Atkinson can be pleased with a silver medal around his neck. He said that younger him â€˜would be proudâ€™ and that he â€˜completely emptiedâ€™ himself and fell off his saddle. His exploits were picked up by Channel 4 show <em>The Last Leg</em>, which described his debut Games as his â€˜origin storyâ€™.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing is for sure. He will be a menace in 2028.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Redemption for Kadeena Cox with team sprint gold</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"890\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Paralympics-GB-970x890.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Paralympics-GB-970x890.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Paralympics-GB-300x275.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Paralympics-GB-768x705.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Paralympics-GB-750x688.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Paralympics-GB-1140x1046.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Paralympics-GB.jpg 1268w\" /><figcaption>ParalympicsGB</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>After posting the second-fastest time in qualifying, it was heartbreak for Kadeena Cox after a crash on the first corner of the C4-5 500m time-trial left her unable to defend her title from Rio and Tokyo. She was able to participate in the C1-5 team sprint a few days later, though, alongside Jaco van Gass, who was gunning for his second gold medal of these Paralympics having defended his C3 3,000m individual pursuit title, and Jody Cundy, who was eyeing to win a medal at each of his eight Paralympic Games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the final day of racing on the velodrome, Cox kicked things off by riding the first lap, followed by Van Gass then Cundy. With their time of 47.738sec they beat the Spanish trio by 1.8sec to retain their title from Tokyo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl dominate</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"665\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Team-Scotland-970x665.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Team-Scotland-970x665.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Team-Scotland-300x206.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Team-Scotland-768x526.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Team-Scotland-1536x1053.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Team-Scotland-2048x1404.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Team-Scotland-750x514.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Team-Scotland-1140x781.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Team Scotland</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl were a force to be reckoned with at the Paralympics. Kicking things off on the track, the pair â€“ Unwin is visually impaired and Holl is her pilot â€“ rode to a bronze medal in the womenâ€™s B time-trial as fellow Brits Elizabeth Jordan and pilot Dannielle Khan scored gold. They then jumped to the top step of the podium in the pursuit, beating Ireland by over two seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The order was reversed on the road time-trial, where Unwin and Hall secured a silver medal against the same two-woman Ireland team. It was a gold medal for the pair in the road race, however, narrowly beating Ireland (again) by three seconds in the sprint to the line.

Graham and Peyroton-Dartet would leave LÃ©autÃ© behind as they closed in on the finish, where Graham outsprinted his French rival to win the gold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was Great Britainâ€™s 43rd gold medal of the Paralympics. They would ultimately finish second in the overall medal standings to China, finishing with 124 medals â€“ 49 gold, 44 silver and 31 bronze.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-cycling-moments-2024-paris-olympics\">The best cycling moments from the 2024 Paris Olympics</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/olympics-add-cycling-events\">The Olympics needs to add these five cycling events</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/handcycling-hill-climb\">Meet the handcyclist whoâ€™s been tackling Britainâ€™s toughest hill climbs</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/dame-sarah-storey-profile\">Neverending Storey: Why Dame Sarah isnâ€™t slowing down yet</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/british-cycling-2024-paris-paralympics\">The best British cycling moments from the Paris 2024 Paralympics</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"87d3e1463f1f23d58972752acbd6ff66f643cb4b44b78c2ed1fd576754c64827","category":"Cycling"}
