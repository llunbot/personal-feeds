In particular, ISPs want the Federal Communications Commission to drop the plan's proposal to require that prices charged to consumers be non-discriminatory.</p>\n<p>In 2021, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf\">Congress required</a> the Federal Communications Commission to issue rules \"preventing digital discrimination of access based on income level, race, ethnicity, color, religion, or national origin\" within two years. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel last month <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/preventing-digital-discrimination-broadband-internet-access\">released her draft plan</a> to comply with the congressional mandate and scheduled a November 15 commission vote on adopting final rules.</p>\n<p>The plan is likely to pass in a party-line vote as Rosenworcel has a 3-2 Democratic majority, but aspects of the draft could be changed before the vote. Next week's meeting could be a contentious one, judging by a <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/carr-opposes-bidens-internet-plan\">statement</a> issued Monday by Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982368#p3\">Read 39 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982368&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aafbe175f85ab1be7b90b148b501b4c79cbf45758f9f1206ae9df4c8eb5172f4","category":"Tech"}
