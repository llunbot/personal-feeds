If you saved an image from it at full resolution, you'd end up with something like a 16,384 × 12,288 image.</p>\n<p>Megapixels don't matter—what matters way more for image quality is the size of each pixel, as bigger pixels (and bigger sensors) capture more light. Samsung is trying to cover both bases with pixel binning, though, which merges several pixels into a bigger pixel for low-light situations. The HP1 has an \"all-new\" variable pixel-binning technology called \"ChameleonCell,\" which lets the sensor bin at 2×2 or 4×4, depending on the amount of light.</p>\n<p>At 4×4, you're ratcheting the 200 MP sensor all the way down to 12.5 MP by merging sets of 16 pixels. This will turn the full-resolution 0.64 μm pixels into a respectable 2.56 μm pixel, which Samsung says \"is capable of more light absorption and sensitivity, producing brighter and clearer photos in in-doors or in the evening.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791563#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791563&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"49cbb074ee67cf8d68e6f7739b3b0e6b8de232b25a5a1b1b4da63f5bf5101d48","category":"Tech"}
