Apple now has four stores\nin the country, where its mobile-payment system Apple Pay will\nsoon become available for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>Around 52% of people age 18 to 29 in South Korea were using an\nApple smartphone as of 2022, up from 44% two years earlier,\naccording to polls by Gallup Korea. Samsung’s share of this age\ngroup slipped to 44% from 45% in that time, the polls showed. For\nall older age groups, Samsung phones remain most prevalent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I did not know that Apple is beating Samsung in Korea in a key demographic like 18–29 year olds.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One bright spot for Samsung is that it is leading the\nfoldable-smartphones category it helped pioneer. Sales of foldable\nphones represent less than 1% of the smartphones shipped worldwide\ntoday, but their increased popularity could boost Samsung’s future\nposition in the premium category, analysts say. Apple has yet to\nannounce any plans for foldable phones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How is it a “bright spot” to lead a category whose sales round down to zero?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/06/iphone-gaining-in-popularity\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d18e16fdb06b954485c4f3e381e4d58b33f4da14c7f0ca732ad06d3dd1cd1776","category":"Tech"}
