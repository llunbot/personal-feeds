But in the almost year since <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/factory-tour-bridge-bike-works-brings-world-class-carbon-bicycle-manufacturing-to-toronto/\" target=\"_blank\">we toured their Toronto factory last fall</a>, they’ve continued to refine manufacturing processes. Now, Bridge has officially launched production of the refined Surveyor all-road bike and are offering its All-Road Integrated fork separately, too…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bridge Bike Works hits production with threaded carbon BB</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to now, Bridge has been only building and selling a limited number of pre-ordered <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-bridge-bike-works-surveyor-all-road-bike-looking-good-made-in-canada/\" target=\"_blank\">Surveyor all-road bikes</a> as they dialed in production. But now with production officially launched, Bridge are now delivering the most common 55cm, 57cm &amp; 59cm framesets out to shops &amp; customers who’ve been waiting patiently. And the remaining 51cm &amp; 53cm frames will head out of their workshop in 4-6 weeks’ time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bridge-Bike-Works-launches-production-with-threaded-carbon-BB-for-Surveyor-all-road-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bridge-Bike-Works-launches-production-with-threaded-carbon-BB-for-Surveyor-all-road-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Bridge Bike Works Surveyor launches made-in-Canada carbon all-road bike production with threaded carbon BB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bridge-Bike-Works-launches-production-with-threaded-carbon-BB-for-Surveyor-all-road-bike.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bridge-Bike-Works-launches-production-with-threaded-carbon-BB-for-Surveyor-all-road-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bridge-Bike-Works-launches-production-with-threaded-carbon-BB-for-Surveyor-all-road-bike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bridge-Bike-Works-launches-production-with-threaded-carbon-BB-for-Surveyor-all-road-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bridge-Bike-Works-launches-production-with-threaded-carbon-BB-for-Surveyor-all-road-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bridge-Bike-Works-launches-production-with-threaded-carbon-BB-for-Surveyor-all-road-bike-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c.

Word is that all bikes they’ve shipped to customers include Bridge’s “industry-first carbon threaded BB” tech. Bridge developed the carbon threads and tested them to 3-5x the standard 30-50Nm or torque a threaded BB usually sees. And they’ve been testing them out on gravel &amp; tarmac with no failures &amp; zero creaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bridge-bike-works-surveyor-all-road-bike-sneak-peek-renderings-7.jpg\"><img width=\"1726\" height=\"1055\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bridge-bike-works-surveyor-all-road-bike-sneak-peek-renderings-7.jpg\" alt=\"bridge bike works surveyor all-road bike frame sneak peek\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bridge-bike-works-surveyor-all-road-bike-sneak-peek-renderings-7.jpg 1726w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bridge-bike-works-surveyor-all-road-bike-sneak-peek-renderings-7-297x182.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bridge-bike-works-surveyor-all-road-bike-sneak-peek-renderings-7-800x489.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bridge-bike-works-surveyor-all-road-bike-sneak-peek-renderings-7-120x73.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bridge-bike-works-surveyor-all-road-bike-sneak-peek-renderings-7-768x469.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bridge-bike-works-surveyor-all-road-bike-sneak-peek-renderings-7-1536x939.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Want the rest of the tech details on this made-in-Canada all-road &amp; fast gravel bike, check <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bridge-bike-works-adds-ultralight-cerakote-paint-options-first-bikes-ship-this-summer/\" target=\"_blank\">our latest Surveyor tech coverage</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ENVE-Grodeo-Builder-Roundup-2023BRIDGE_23-1-2048x1537-Large-e1689951622963.jpeg\"><img width=\"1276\" height=\"752\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ENVE-Grodeo-Builder-Roundup-2023BRIDGE_23-1-2048x1537-Large-e1689951622963.jpeg\" alt=\"ENVE-Grodeo-Builder-Roundup-2023BRIDGE_23-1-2048x1537 Large\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ENVE-Grodeo-Builder-Roundup-2023BRIDGE_23-1-2048x1537-Large-e1689951622963.jpeg 1276w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ENVE-Grodeo-Builder-Roundup-2023BRIDGE_23-1-2048x1537-Large-e1689951622963-297x175.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ENVE-Grodeo-Builder-Roundup-2023BRIDGE_23-1-2048x1537-Large-e1689951622963-800x471.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ENVE-Grodeo-Builder-Roundup-2023BRIDGE_23-1-2048x1537-Large-e1689951622963-120x71.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ENVE-Grodeo-Builder-Roundup-2023BRIDGE_23-1-2048x1537-Large-e1689951622963-768x453.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c. <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/enve-grodeo-is-back-artisan-bike-builder-roundup-part-one/\" target=\"_blank\">ENVE Grodeo</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bridge also updated their deposit structure.
