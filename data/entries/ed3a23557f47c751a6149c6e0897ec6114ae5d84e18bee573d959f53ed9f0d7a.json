Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#maps-cycling\">maintains a list</a> of all of the areas where cycling directions are available on its website, but as of writing this, it has not yet been updated to include Switzerland and Sweden.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks MacRumors forum member <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-maps-now-offers-cycling-directions-in-switzerland.2418875/post-32924321\">Virtuality</a> for Sweden!)</em><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/switzerland/\">Switzerland</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/apple-maps-cycling-directions-switzerland/\">Apple Maps Now Offers Cycling Directions in Switzerland and Sweden</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-maps-now-offers-cycling-directions-in-switzerland-and-sweden.2418875/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ed3a23557f47c751a6149c6e0897ec6114ae5d84e18bee573d959f53ed9f0d7a","category":"Apple"}
