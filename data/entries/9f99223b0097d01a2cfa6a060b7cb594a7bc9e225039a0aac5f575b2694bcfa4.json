The critics have said that details Microsoft has disclosed so far lead to the inescapable conclusion that vulnerabilities in code for Azure AD and other cloud offerings were exploited to pull off the successful hack.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957158#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957158&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9f99223b0097d01a2cfa6a060b7cb594a7bc9e225039a0aac5f575b2694bcfa4","category":"Tech"}
