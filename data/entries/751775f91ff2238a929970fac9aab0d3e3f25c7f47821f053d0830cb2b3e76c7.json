The updated accessories are expected to be equipped with USB-C ports instead of Lightning ports for charging. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/magic-mouse-2-lightning.jpeg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" />\r<br />\nThe accessories will likely be unveiled alongside an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/next-gen-imac-details-rumored-ahead-of-event/\">updated 24-inch iMac with an M3 chip</a>, which Gurman also expects to be announced at the event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear if the accessories will have any design changes beyond the switch to USB-C. They look largely the same as they did when they received their last major update in October 2015, although there have been some minor revisions over the years, including a switch to braided cables, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/new-m1-imac-accessories/\">new color options</a> that are only available with the 24-inch iMac. Apple also released a Magic Keyboard with a Touch ID button in 2021.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the Magic Mouse lasts around a month or longer between charges, the position of the Lightning port on the bottom of the mouse has been a meme in the Apple community for many years, as it prevents the mouse from being used while charging. It's unclear if the USB-C port on the new version will be placed in a more convenient location.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 15 models are equipped with USB-C ports instead of Lightning. The latest Siri Remote for the Apple TV also has a USB-C port, and Apple discontinued the MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Duo Charger with Lightning ports.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's event on October 30 begins at the unusual time of 5 p.m. Pacific/8 p.m. Eastern, so make sure to mark your calendar correctly.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-mouse/\">Magic Mouse</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/\">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event/\">New Magic Mouse With USB-C Port Expected at Apple Event Next Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-magic-mouse-with-usb-c-port-expected-at-apple-event-next-week.2408877/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"751775f91ff2238a929970fac9aab0d3e3f25c7f47821f053d0830cb2b3e76c7","category":"Apple"}
