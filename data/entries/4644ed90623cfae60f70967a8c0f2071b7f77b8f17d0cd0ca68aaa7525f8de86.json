It's unclear when the update will be released, but it will likely be available either this week or next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/iOS-16.5.1-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nMinor updates like iOS 16.5.1 are typically focused on bug fixes, stability improvements, and security patches, rather than new features. Apple's Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/ios-16-5-bug-with-lightning-usb-3-camera-adapter/\">does not work properly</a> with iPhones running iOS 16.5, but the issue was resolved in the iOS 16.6 beta last month, so a fix is likely to be included in iOS 16.5.1 as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple released the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-releases-ios-17-beta/\">first beta of iOS 17</a> at WWDC last week. The update will be publicly released later this year for the iPhone XS and newer, and has many new features, including a StandBy mode while an iPhone is charging in a landscape position, interactive Home Screen widgets, improved autocorrect, a Journal app, and more. For the first time, developer betas are available <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/developer-betas-free-to-download/\">without a $99/year Apple Developer program membership</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this month, Apple revealed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/01/apple-shares-ios-16-adoption-statistics/\">81% of all active iPhones were running iOS 16</a>, but that percentage has surely declined following the iOS 17 beta. Apple will likely release iOS 17 in September, around the time that iPhone 15 models launch.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/12/apple-preparing-ios-16-5-1/\">Apple Preparing iOS 16.5.1 Update for iPhone Following iOS 17 Beta</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-ios-16-5-1-update-for-iphone-following-ios-17-beta.2392647/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4644ed90623cfae60f70967a8c0f2071b7f77b8f17d0cd0ca68aaa7525f8de86","category":"Apple"}
