And today it’s cheaper than ever: Amazon is selling the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Smart-Midnight-Aluminum/dp/B0BDJ1MVBV/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Watch SE for $219 (40mm)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Smart-Midnight-Aluminum/dp/B0BDHVMTPD/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$249 (44mm)</a>, a savings of 130 and the lowest price we’ve seen for the second-generation model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch SE has a slightly older design than the Series 8, but it’s still a great smartwatch, with a heart-rate sensor, fantastic OLED display, and speedy S8 processor. It’s missing an always-on display and some of the higher-end sensors such as temperature and blood-oxygen, but it has Apple’s newest Crash Detection feature that will notify emergency services if you’re wearing it while in a high-speed crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even without high-end features, the Apple Watch SE is a perfect entry-level watch for any iPhone user looking to get their first smartwatch.</p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6acf48ae784a9dfbd81af24cce4a51a05d12053e96d26ec7a548eb6feae15f04","category":"Apple"}
