Right on time for that anniversary, Shout Factory will release an UltraHD Blu-ray of the movie. This will be the first time it has ever been available in 4K.</p>\n<p>Releasing July 2 but pre-ordering now, the disc will include a new 4K scan of the original 35mm negative, along with audio commentary from Weird Al and Jay Levy, the film's director.</p>\n<p>It will also come bundled with a standard HD Blu-ray that includes the film in that older format along with a bunch of special features, including video of a 2024 Comic-Con panel on the movie, delete scenes, behind-the-scenes videos, and some other assets. Some of those return from the movie's last physical edition, which was a 25th anniversary HD Blu-ray, but not 4K.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021071#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021071&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"67a60f25616931568b65cf75e016354c118150ca3555b7eaf8b9f3c72c4c41ed","category":"Tech"}
