Now researchers are warning that the leaked information revealed what could amount to critical zero-day vulnerabilities that could imperil huge swaths of the computing world.</p>\n<p>The vulnerabilities reside inside firmware that Duluth, Georgia-based AMI makes for BMCs (baseboard management controllers). These tiny computers soldered into the motherboard of servers allow cloud centers, and sometimes their customers, to streamline the remote management of vast fleets of computers. They enable administrators to remotely reinstall OSes, install and uninstall apps, and control just about every other aspect of the system—even when it's turned off. BMCs provide what’s known in the industry as “lights-out” system management.</p>\n<h2>Lights-out forever</h2>\n<p>Researchers from security firm Eclypsium analyzed AMI firmware leaked in the <a href=\"https://therecord.media/motherboard-vendor-gigabyte-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware-gang\">2021 ransomware attack</a> and identified vulnerabilities that had lurked for years. They can be exploited by any local or remote attacker with access to an industry-standard remote-management interface known as Redfish to execute malicious code that will run on every server inside a data center.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955540#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955540&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"609813b90f92c9efc0a9778b40b3ea3c5815af8f4b5fae8b9613c21480e7a312","category":"Tech"}
