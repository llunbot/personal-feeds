The device was met with mixed reviews; critics praised its outstanding sound quality but pointed out its high price, missing features, and limited functionality compared to rivals.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/04/apple-cuts-homepod-price-worldwide/\">dropped its price</a> from $349 to $299 in April 2019 and, in March 2021, the company announced that it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/\">discontinuing</a> the first-generation ‌HomePod‌, instead shifting its focus to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>, which launched the previous year. The decision left a gap in Apple's product lineup for a full-sized smart speaker until the company introduced the second-generation model via a press release on January 18, 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe second-generation ‌HomePod‌ looks virtually identical to the original, although it is 0.2 inches shorter and has a larger edge-to-edge LED touchscreen on top. It also boasts a range of upgrades and changes compared to its 2018 predecessor:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌HomePod‌ (second-generation, 2023)</th>\r<br />\n <th>‌HomePod‌ (first-generation, 2018)</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Refined design with acoustically transparent mesh fabric</td>\r<br />\n <td>Design with acoustically transparent mesh fabric</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Larger backlit touch surface that illuminates from edge to edge</td>\r<br />\n <td>Backlit touch surface</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>S7 chip from 2021's Apple Watch Series 7</td>\r<br />\n <td>A8 chip from 2013's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 6 and ‌iPhone‌ 6 Plus</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>U1 ultra wideband chip</td>\r<br />\n <td>–</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Five horn-loaded tweeters</td>\r<br />\n <td>Seven horn-loaded tweeters</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Four far-field beamforming microphones</td>\r<br />\n <td>Six far-field beamforming microphones</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>6.6 inches tall</td>\r<br />\n <td>6.8 inches tall</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Weighs 5.16 pounds</td>\r<br />\n <td>Weighs 5.5 pounds</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Removable power cable</td>\r<br />\n <td>Fixed power cable</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Wi-Fi 4 connectivity (802.11n)</td>\r<br />\n <td>Wi-Fi 5 connectivity (802.11ac)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Thread support</td>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Temperature and humidity sensor</td>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Sound Recognition</td>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Available in White and Midnight</td>\r<br />\n <td>Available in White and Space Gray</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n </table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Apple's potential plans for a third-generation ‌HomePod‌ are unclear a year after the current model was introduced, there are a multitude of rumors surrounding a ‌HomePod‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/future-homepod-to-add-curved-lcd-display/\">with an LCD touchscreen display</a> arriving <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/homepod-with-screen-delayed-next-year/\">as soon as 2024</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/apple-reintroduced-the-homepod-a-year-ago-today/\">Apple Reintroduced the HomePod a Year Ago Today</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reintroduced-the-homepod-a-year-ago-today.2416687/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"93ba9b4f6dc4b92d503b678477fdf9e26e090085e29eaac1e69a978044cf35d7","category":"Apple"}
