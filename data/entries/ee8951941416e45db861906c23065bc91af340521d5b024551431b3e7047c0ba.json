The iPhone 15 mostly resembles its predecessor but swaps the top-of-screen notch for the \"Dynamic Island\" Apple introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro last year, and it ditches Apple's proprietary Lightning port in favor of the industry-standard USB-C.</p>\n<p>Like the iPhone 14, the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/0ZRY1R\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 15</a> comes in two screen sizes: 6.1 inches for the standard phone, and 6.7 for the iPhone 15 Plus. The two models are the same apart from the screen sizes. The iPhone 15-series' overall design is also similar to that of its predecessor, with a glass back and front and an aluminum enclosure.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-iPhone-15-lineup-hero-230912.jpg\"><img alt=\"The iPhone 15 Plus (left) and iPhone 15 (right).\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-iPhone-15-lineup-hero-230912-640x896.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-iPhone-15-lineup-hero-230912-1280x1792.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-iPhone-15-lineup-hero-230912.jpg\">The iPhone 15 Plus (left) and iPhone 15 (right).</a> (credit: <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/2023/09/apple-debuts-iphone-15-and-iphone-15-plus/article/Apple-iPhone-15-lineup-hero-230912_inline.jpg.medium_2x.jpg\">Apple</a>)</p></div>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                <h3>Apple iPhone 15 series                                                </h3>\n                        <div>\n                                                            <ul>\n                                        \n                                    <li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/0ZRY1R\" target=\"_blank\">$799 iPhone 15 at Apple</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                        \n                                    <li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/0ZRY1R\" target=\"_blank\">$899 iPhone 15 Plus at Apple</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                                                    </ul>\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <div>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<p>The edge of the aluminum enclosure has a new contoured design that looks a bit different from the iPhone 14, though. Apple also claims the iPhone 15 devices are the first phones to have a \"color-infused back glass.\" Apple's announcement said that it strengthened the phones' back glass with a \"dual-ion exchange process\" and then polished it with nanocrystalline particles and etched it for a \"textured matte finish.\" The new iPhones still have a Ceramic Shield front cover and are water and dust-resistant.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964590#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964590&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ee8951941416e45db861906c23065bc91af340521d5b024551431b3e7047c0ba","category":"Tech"}
