Researchers from MIT and the University of Chicago have now found that lunar soil samples collected by astronauts during the Apollo era show evidence that meteorites, from hulking meteors to micrometeoroids no bigger than specks of dust, have launched a steady flow of atoms into the exosphere.</p>\n<p>Though some of these atoms escape into space and others fall back to the surface, those that do remain above the Moon create a thin atmosphere that keeps being replenished as more meteorites crash into the surface.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043696#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043696&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ae532d94ea681276f62bb244227c3b868983c70915cbcb6ed18036218ad30d6c","category":"Tech"}
