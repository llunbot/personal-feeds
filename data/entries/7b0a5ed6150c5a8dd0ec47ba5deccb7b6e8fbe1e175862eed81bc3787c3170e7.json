Restaurants, parking garages, merchants, and charities display them to make it easy for people to open online menus or to make online payments. QR codes are also used in security-sensitive contexts. YouTube, Apple TV, and dozens of other TV apps, for instance, allow someone to sign in to their account by scanning a QR code displayed on the screen. The code opens a page on a browser or app of the phone, where the account password is already stored. Once open, the page authenticates the same account to be opened on the TV app. Two-factor authentication apps provide a similar flow using QR codes when enrolling a new account.</p>\n<p>The ubiquity of QR codes and the trust placed in them hasn’t been lost on scammers, however. For more than two years now, parking lot kiosks that allow people to make payments through their phones have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/scammers-put-fake-qr-codes-on-parking-meters-to-intercept-parkers-payments/\">been a favorite target</a>. Scammers paste QR codes over the legitimate ones. The scam QR codes lead to look-alike sites that funnel funds to fraudulent accounts rather than the ones controlled by the parking garage.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990254#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990254&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7b0a5ed6150c5a8dd0ec47ba5deccb7b6e8fbe1e175862eed81bc3787c3170e7","category":"Tech"}
