From that point the victory was never in doubt and the Frenchman finished 44 seconds clear of Jesús Herrada for his first ever Vuelta stage win and his first Grand Tour success since <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/3118/romain-bardet-wins-tour-de-france-stage-12-aru-takes-yellow\" target=\"_blank\">Stage 12 of the 2017 Tour de France</a>.</p>\n<p>With it came the polka dot jersey of mountains points leader, with Bardet understandably delighted afterwards. 'We really played smart with Matt [Winston], my sports director. He told me exactly when to attack on the steepest ramp as if the finish was just 200m away,' he told Eurosport afterwards. </p>\n<p>'<span>I’ve been second too many times. Today I went full gas to be in a good breakaway. I knew that if I could get the king of the mountains jersey too it’d be a double bonus, and I've made the day my own.'</span></p>\n<p>Ineos Grenadiers’ Tom Pidcock, also in the break, produced a similar kind of ride to finish fourth after looking like being seriously distanced earlier on the climb.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2104/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a Espana 2021: Route, start list, live TV guide and all we know so far</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10017/flanders-uci-road-cycling-world-championships-2021-key-information\">Flanders UCI Road Cycling World Championships 2021: Key information</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 117: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nBardet was already over the line when the GC favourites in the peloton hit the business end of the stage themselves.</p>\n<p>Guillaume Martin (Cofidis), second overall, was the first to try a meaningful attack, looking to gain the 58 seconds he needed to wrestle the red jersey from leader Odd Christian Eiking (Intermarche-Wanty-Gobert).</p>\n<p>Then a far more dangerous attack came from Miguel Ángel López of Movistar, which saw a major selection made among his rivals behind. López would be the first across the line from the main field, but in the end gained just four seconds on an elite quartet of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> (Jumbo-Visma), Movistar teammate Enric Mas, Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) and Jack Haig (Bahrain Victorious).</p>\n<p>Eiking wasn’t with them, but rode well to limit his losses to just 20 seconds and remain comfortably in the red jersey. Martin did gain 4 seconds to close the gap slightly, but Roglič remains the favourite for the race overall, sitting third at 1:36sec with a huge final week of racing ahead.</p>\n<p>As always, photographer Chris Auld captured the sights and sounds from the day on camera…</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10031/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-14-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 38</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/vuelta_a_espana_2021_stage_14_01.jpg?itok=c8M1e_aB\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>38</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/10031/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-14-gallery\">Vuelta a Espana 2021 Stage 14 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/chris-auld\">Chris Auld</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>29 Aug 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10031%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-14-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2014%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10031%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-14-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2014%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10031%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-14-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2014%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10031%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-14-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10031/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-14-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 38</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/vuelta_a_espana_2021_stage_14_01.jpg?itok=c8M1e_aB\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6be9af84dfd10f27aa71c73dc49a8c45494e2fe68195bcc2c129e55339537d9b","category":"Cycling"}
