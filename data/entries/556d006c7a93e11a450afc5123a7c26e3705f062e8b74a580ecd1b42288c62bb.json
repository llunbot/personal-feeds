Here’s how to report it","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/234622/how-to-report-wrong-locations-in-apple-maps.html","date":1683536400000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>No map is perfect; all are approximations. But it’s galling to business owners when a modern digital map lists the wrong address, has incorrect business hours, or even says the business is closed when it’s still open. Many, many people email Mac 911 asking for help with this when customers can’t find them. Or, to take real examples I’ve received, when an address listed offered a dangerous turnoff that wasn’t the main entrance–or when people living in a newly-issued U.K. post code were directed miles away from their destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Maps offers a correction feature that’s changed and expanded slightly in recent releases for iOS/iPadOS and macOS. You don’t have to be a business owner to suggest changes or request a correction. Mistaken addresses and routes of course affect homeowners and renters, too, as well as non-profits, schools, and other organizations. (Google Maps years ago placed my house four miles west for about six months, which was a constant problem for deliveries, service people, and parents trying to bring their kids over for playdates and birthday parties.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow the steps below to report errors or add places that aren’t listed. Note that human beings do review the additions and changes; they’re not made higgledy-piggledy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t have access to an Apple device or don’t want to use a Maps app to report, you can use <a href=\"https://apple.co/3lXTnhP\">a little-known form to report the problem</a>. Apple also says you can call their helpline, AppleCare 1-800-APLCARE in the U.S. or 0800 0480408 in the U.K., to report map problems, though I know no one who has.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to correct and add address information on iPhone or iPad</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ios-15-maps-report-issue.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 15 Maps report an issue\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ios-15-maps-report-issue.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ios-15-maps-report-issue.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ios-15-maps-report-issue.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ios-15-maps-report-issue.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ios-15-maps-report-issue.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ios-15-maps-report-issue.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ios-15-maps-report-issue.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ios-15-maps-report-issue.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption><p>To report an issue with a location in iOS 15 or later, use the three-dot menu.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>To correct a listing:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Launch Maps.</li><li><span>Tap a location.</span> </li><li><span>Tap the three-dot menu to the right of the estimated time of arrival.</span> </li><li>Tap <em>Report an Issue</em>.</li><li><span>Tap the issue you want to correct.</span> </li><li>Edit the information.</li><li><span>Tap </span><em>Submit</em><span>.</span> </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>To add a listing:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Launch Maps.</li><li><span>Hold down on the map to create a </span><em>Dropped Pin</em><span>.</span> </li><li><span>Tap the three-dot menu.</span> </li><li>Tap <em>Add to Maps</em>.</li><li><span>Tap what you want to add (address, place, transit stop, etc.).</span> </li><li><span>Fill in details and ensure the pin is over the correct location.</span> </li><li><span>Tap </span><em>Send</em>. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also tap Mark My Location at the bottom of the screen to quickly drop a pin at your location and then follow the steps above.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to correct and add address location on a Mac </h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maps-big-sur-report-issue.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Big Sur Maps report issue\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maps-big-sur-report-issue.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maps-big-sur-report-issue.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maps-big-sur-report-issue.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maps-big-sur-report-issue.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maps-big-sur-report-issue.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maps-big-sur-report-issue.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maps-big-sur-report-issue.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maps-big-sur-report-issue.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption><p>You can easily report an issue with a location in Maps in Big Sur.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>macOS Big Sur and later</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To correct a listing:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Launch Maps.</li><li><span>Click a place’s icon.</span> </li><li>Tap the three-dot menu next <span>to the right of the location name.</span></li><li><span>Scroll down to </span><em>Report an Issue</em><span> at the very bottom and click it.</span> </li><li><span>You can then modify and detail, including location, and click </span><em>Submit</em><span>.</span> </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not at first obvious that there’s more to the dialog in some cases, as the map may appear to be the only thing you can select.
