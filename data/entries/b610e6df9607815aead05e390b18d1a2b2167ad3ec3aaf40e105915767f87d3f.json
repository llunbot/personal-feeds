For example, if you press and hold down the letter O, a palette with ô, ö, ò, ó, œ, ø, ō, and õ appears, each with a number underneath. Press the number that corresponds to the character you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of that feature, though, you can no longer press and hold keys to make them repeat, making it a bit tougher to type <em>woooooooohooooooooo</em>, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/text-options-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /><figcaption><p>With some keys in macOS, you can press and hold down the key and a character palette appears instead of the charatcer repeating itself.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the Terminal to disable macOS’s character palette and restore key repeating. It’s pretty simple. In Terminal (/Applications/Utilites), paste the command below and press Return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now log out of your account and log back in. You’ll find that you can press and hold repeating letters with nary a care in the world. <em>Woooooooohooooooooo</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To stop the key-repeating behavior and reinstate the character palette, copy that command about and paste it into Terminal, but then replace <code>false</code> with <code>true</code>. Log out of your Mac and log back in to implement the change.</p>\n</div>","author":"Lex Friedman","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b610e6df9607815aead05e390b18d1a2b2167ad3ec3aaf40e105915767f87d3f","category":"Apple"}
