The four-man team lifted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Thursday, kicking off a 36-hour pursuit of the orbiting research laboratory. Docking is scheduled for Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>This two-week mission is managed by Houston-based Axiom Space, which is conducting these private astronaut missions as a stepping stone toward building a fully commercial space station in low-Earth orbit by the end of this decade.</p>\n<p>Axiom's third mission, called Ax-3, launched at 4:49 pm EST (21:49 UTC) Thursday. The four astronauts were strapped into their seats inside SpaceX's Dragon Freedom spacecraft atop the Falcon 9 rocket. This is the 12th time SpaceX has launched a human spaceflight mission, and could be the first of five Dragon crew missions this year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997288#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997288&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"27145358d1a9d55a313a82d644caed802e7d92e217b44713bd663fb7a660dfe1","category":"Tech"}
