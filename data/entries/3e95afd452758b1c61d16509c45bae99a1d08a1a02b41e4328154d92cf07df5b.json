To celebrate the most romantic day of the year, we have another set of cycling goodies to get tucked into on this week’s<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/in-the-drops\"> In The Drops</a>. Before we dig into this Friday’s selection, let’s take a look at what we’ve been getting up to this week at <em>Cyclist</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In pro news, the cycling broadcast apocalypse continued this week. French newspaper <em>Le Parisien</em> unearthed that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/netflix-cancel-tour-de-france-unchained\">Netflix’s cycling docu-series <em>Tour de France: Unchained</em> will be axed</a> after the final series airs in June. Don’t forget, cycling will soon move to TNT Sports after the channel absorbed Eurosport into its subscription package. If you’re looking to watch one last WorldTour race on Eurosport before it gets unplugged, then take a look at our<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uae-tour-men-preview\"> preview of the men’s UAE Tour</a>, which will take place next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, we’ve been gearing up for the season, which is well and truly underway with racing in Spain, Oman and France this week. Robyn delved into the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/men-sprinters-2025\">sprinting class of 2025</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-paris-roubaix\">she’s weighed up the chances of Tadej Pogačar going to Paris-Roubaix</a> after the Slovenian teased us with a video on the Trouée d’Arenberg earlier this week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In tech, Cannondale released its<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-superx-gravel-bike\"> latest lightweight gravel bike, the SuperX</a>, and you can get a peek at Ineos Grenadiers’ kit on the factory floor as Laurence took <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gobik-insider\">a tour of Gobik’s HQ.</a> Spoiler alert: one of Filippo Ganna’s skinsuits costs well over £1,000 to produce. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s enough preamble, let’s get the romantic candles and petrol station flowers out, it’s time to get in the drops.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>HoverAir X1 Pro Drone</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-v1-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-v1-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-v1-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-v1-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-v1-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-v1-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-v1-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-v1-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-v1-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-v1.png 1500w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking to capture your rides from a new angle, then a drone may be the way to elevate your cycling photography and video game. HoverAir has released a sports-specialised drone capable of following you on the bike as you trundle up hills, dive down gravel tracks or tackle leafy Sunday rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed for cyclists, skiers and hikers in mind, the X1 Pro drone is remarkably portable and lightweight, coming in at just 192g. The drone folds up into the size of an A5 sheet of paper (shown below) at around 10cm tall and 15cm wide. In other words, just the right size to fit into a jersey’s pockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/hoverair-drone-2-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/hoverair-drone-2-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/hoverair-drone-2-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/hoverair-drone-2-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/hoverair-drone-2-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/hoverair-drone-2-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/hoverair-drone-2-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/hoverair-drone-2-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/hoverair-drone-2-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/hoverair-drone-2.png 1500w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Shooting in 4K at a frame rate between 30fps to 120fps, the drone is equipped with a video camera that pops out its cockpit when flying. The high frame-rate is also ideal if you’re looking to create slow-motion videos on the bike. The camera is equipped with video stabilisation technology and is steadied by a two-axis gimbal, meaning the video remains as smooth as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are ten flying modes available on X1 Pro as indicated on the screen found above the cockpit. It can fly for up to 16 minutes at a given time while shooting high-definition video or taking photos. In its auto-follow mode, the drone can reach a maximum speed of 42kph (26mph), but this can be overridden to reach speeds of 60kph (42mph) in its instantaneous flying setting. In terms of the elements, the X1 Pro can withstand winds of up to 24kph and can be used at altitudes up to 5,500m. In Europe, that’s plenty.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-in-action-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-in-action-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-in-action-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-in-action-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-in-action-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-in-action-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-in-action-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-in-action-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-in-action-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/drone-in-action.png 1500w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The drone links up to an app on your phone, allowing you to control it while riding (just as long as you’re within 250m). Videos can also be downloaded through the app, but they’re originally stored on the drone’s 64GB built-in memory card – that can be increased with an added SD Card. Exporting videos and photos from the drone is relatively simple and fast if you have a steady internet connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the rider, the drone can fly ahead or behind you, but it can’t shoot from the side (ie fly parallel to the bike), which is a bit of a disadvantage. Given it works off recognition, it can sometimes be a little slow to recognise who you are and it takes a while to warm up and get into position. That said, it’s in its element on climbs, helping to capture those two-wheel adventures from an all new angle. Well, perhaps not a new angle, birds have been flying for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy from<a href=\"https://uk.hoverair.com/products/hoverair-x1-pro-promax?_gl=1*5owr22*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAzba9BhBhEiwA7glbansaviCgOqes8vjigL0H-hsqTI2brbO1bZBn85Q_X75ipwLHjXWJyBoCit8QAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\"> HoverAir (£459)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+5\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-5-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-5-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-5-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-5-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-5-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-5-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-5-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-5-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Paria CC Sherpa Fleece Cycling Commuter Jacket</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paria-jacket-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paria-jacket-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paria-jacket-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paria-jacket-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paria-jacket-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paria-jacket-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paria-jacket-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paria-jacket-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paria-jacket-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paria-jacket.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping me cosy this month has been Paria’s Sherpa Commuter Jacket.

for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-cycling-esports-world-championships\">UCI Cycling Esports World Championships</a>, MyWhoosh is a relatively new player in the online cycling game. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-cycling-training-apps\">virtual cycling app</a> is free to access and underwent a big upgrade towards the end of 2024, with a remodelled UI and app, enhanced social features and better workout options. MyWhoosh also now offers live training sessions with three-time World Champion – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cyclists-on-reality-tv\">and future contestant in the celebrity dancing competition <em>Let’s Dance</em></a> – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/peter-sagan-podcast\">Peter Sagan</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although MyWhoosh is free, it’s now possible to step up your training with a season pass. Spanning 90 days, the pass grants you access to extra challenges, game modes, in-app rewards and new worlds, including a Japanese circuit. This latest season pass also allows you to further customise your avatar with new clothing, fresh wheels or even a vintage bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking to achieve your fitness goals without paywalled roadblocks, the season pass will come in handy. If you’re feeling ambitious and have dreams of making it to the startline of the next Esports World Championships, then it will help you fly up MyWhoosh’s leaderboard. The top-ranked players receive a wildcard entry to the championships, so that’ll give you something to work towards.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy from <a href=\"https://www.mywhoosh.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MyWhoosh (150 in-game gems, approx £8.00)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bioracer Flandrien Series</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/bioracer-flandrien-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/bioracer-flandrien-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/bioracer-flandrien-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/bioracer-flandrien-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/bioracer-flandrien-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/bioracer-flandrien-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/bioracer-flandrien-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/bioracer-flandrien-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/bioracer-flandrien-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/bioracer-flandrien.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re only two weeks away from the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Classics</a>. Yes, on 1st March, the one-day calendar kicks off with Omloop Het Nieuwsblad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In celebration of the Classics, Belgian brand Bioracer offers its Flandrien line of kit inspired by characters within the peloton: the Pedaleur, Baroudeur, Puncheur and Rouleur. I’ve got the Pedaleur variant, a reference to the French term <em>pédaleur de charme</em> – used to refer to a rider with an elegant style and charming personality. Thanks Bioracer for the glowing compliment. Little do they know that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/salzburg-austria-gravel-ride\">I look like a panicked stick insect on climbs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This swirling blue and black jersey has a comfortable but aero-like feel, particularly on the sleeves. The sleek look is complemented by a golden stripe down the back, which is not too dissimilar to the classic Team Sky jerseys.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy from <a href=\"https://shop.bioracer.com/flandrien-series-capsule-collection/\" target=\"_blank\">Bioracer (£57.91)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into this week: The Eurovision build-up</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/latvia-2025-tautumeitas-1296x700-1-edited.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/latvia-2025-tautumeitas-1296x700-1-edited.jpg 1050w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/latvia-2025-tautumeitas-1296x700-1-edited-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/latvia-2025-tautumeitas-1296x700-1-edited-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/latvia-2025-tautumeitas-1296x700-1-edited-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/latvia-2025-tautumeitas-1296x700-1-edited-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/latvia-2025-tautumeitas-1296x700-1-edited-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/latvia-2025-tautumeitas-1296x700-1-edited-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/latvia-2025-tautumeitas-1296x700-1-edited-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>LTV</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people consider the Eurovision Song Contest to be a one-week affair in May. This is with good reason, that’s when some 40 entries from across Europe compete on the big stage in front of 200 million viewers at home, making it the world’s largest non-sporting entertainment show. However, for die-hard Eurofans, the Eurovision season is already in full swing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between Christmas and mid-March, Europe selects its contestants for the pop-fuelled contest, set to take place on Saturday 17th May in Basel, Switzerland. So far, the Eurovision playlist is taking shape after a string of announcements and national contests over the past few weeks. Some highlights include Malta, which will be ‘serving kant’ courtesy of their <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8qNK1tt6L5k\" target=\"_blank\">Sound of Music hommage titled <em>Kant</em></a>, Finland’s campy <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Kg3QoTpnqyw\" target=\"_blank\">ode to climaxing</a> and Latvia’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fAdN-OUYe54\" target=\"_blank\">folk vocal group called Tautumeitas</a>. Try saying that after a few beers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s more fun to come over the next month. Sweden’s national selection Melodifesivalen – a show that reaches 80% of TV sets in the country during its six-week run – will see the return of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sGOwFVUU0I\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Eurovision winner Måns Zelmerlöw</a>. Estonian rapper and Charli XCX collaborator Tommy Cash will compete in Estonia’s national selection this weekend and French popstar Louane will perform her Eurovision entry for the first time during the Six Nations match between France and Scotland. Sorry, rugby fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For British readers, there are some rumours already circulating about who will represent the UK at Eurovision next year. Country group Remember Monday is the frontrunner, having been leaked by <em>The Sun</em> and accidentally revealed by radio DJs last week. However, we await official confirmation from the BBC. As for Ireland, they have chosen the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nPxNykJ34U\" target=\"_blank\">Laika Party</a>, an early 2000s-inspired dance song about the Soviet dog Laika who died in outer space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, here are some of my picks from the over 400 songs in contention for the Eurovision 2025 trophy.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hoverair-drone\">In The Drops: HoverAir drone, Paria Sherpa fleece, MyWhoosh Season Pass, Bioracer’s Flandrien Collection and Eurovision preparations</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"3e95afd452758b1c61d16509c45bae99a1d08a1a02b41e4328154d92cf07df5b","category":"Cycling"}
