But working in corporate America, I need to have access to Microsoft apps like Excel and Word to easily send files to the rest of my team who aren’t as Apple-forward as I am. Though I was previously paying monthly for Microsoft 365, I found a cheaper way to get access to those same apps — and I get access to them for life. <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-home-business-for-mac-2021-lifetime-license-2?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-1349&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-home-business-for-mac-2021-lifetime-license-25-04-15&amp;utm_term=SALE-324074\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Office 2021 for Mac is now just $69.97</a> for a lifetime license.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A subscription to Microsoft 365 is $9.99 per month or $99.99 for the year for a Personal account. I’ve decided to step away from subscription-based software after seeing just how many I “set and forget.” Not only can you get access to Microsoft Office 2021 for life, it’s also $30 cheaper, and in this economy, every dollar counts.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp0.stackassets.com/8fb6fae4a5c61b788844f976254e1acee8d72fcc/store/c245f8d07be00a8953b72044a14aea0cee8ac5c65d42c41fd01dce7196c6/product_336440_product_shots3.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business for Mac 2021: Lifetime License<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-home-business-for-mac-2021-lifetime-license-2?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-1349&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-home-business-for-mac-2021-lifetime-license-2025-04-19&amp;utm_term=SALE-324074\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lifetime membership includes access to your favorite apps like Excel, Word, and PowerPoint on a single computer.
