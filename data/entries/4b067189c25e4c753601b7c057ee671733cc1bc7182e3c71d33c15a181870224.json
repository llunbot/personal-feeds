NASA also notched a big win, gaining the competition with SpaceX it sought for landing services. But there is a more profound takeaway from this.</p>\n<p>After losing the initial lander contract to SpaceX two years ago, Blue Origin did not just bid a lower price this time around. Instead, it radically transformed the means by which it would put humans on the Moon. The Blue Moon lander is now completely reusable; it will remain in lunar orbit, going up and down to the surface. It will be serviced by a transport vehicle that will be fueled in low-Earth orbit and then deliver propellant to the Moon. This transporter, in turn, will be refilled by multiple launches of the reusable New Glenn rocket.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941295#p3\">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941295&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b067189c25e4c753601b7c057ee671733cc1bc7182e3c71d33c15a181870224","category":"Tech"}
