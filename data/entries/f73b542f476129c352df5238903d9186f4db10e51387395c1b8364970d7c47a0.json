Previous rumors have claimed the MacBook Pro will switch to OLED display technology <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/oled-macbook-pro-could-launch-as-soon-as-2026/\">as early as 2026</a>. In the meantime, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and display industry analyst Ross Young both recently predicted that the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/macbook-pro-wont-switch-to-oled-in-2025-rumor/\">continue to have mini-LED displays in 2025</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCompared to current MacBook Pro models with mini-LED screens, benefits of OLED technology would include increased brightness, higher contrast ratio with deeper blacks, improved power efficiency for longer battery life, and more. The switch to OLED displays could also contribute to future MacBook Pro models having a thinner design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSecond is the just-mentioned thinner design. Earlier this year, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-plans-thinner-iphone-slimmer-macbook/\">working to make the MacBook Pro thinner</a> over the \"next couple of years.\" He said that Apple is aiming to create a class of devices that \"should be the thinnest and lightest products in their categories across the whole tech industry.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA more vivid OLED display and a much thinner design would be more compelling upgrades that might finally drive existing Apple silicon MacBook Pro users to upgrade.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/future-macbook-pro-rumors/\">Skipping the New MacBook Pro?
