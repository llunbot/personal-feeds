I’ve often wondered what to do with all of the coolness that people write, and while I share a lot of it on <a href=\"https://x.com/dcrainmakerblog\">Twitter/X</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/dcrainmaker.com\">BlueSky</a>, this is a better forum for sending it on to y’all. Most times these different streams don’t overlap, so be on the lookout at all these places for good stuff!</p>\n<p>So with that, let’s get into the action!</p>\n<h3><strong><span>DCR Posts In The Past Week:</span></strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s all the latest posts on the site:</p>\n<p><strong>Sunday:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/fit-file-instinct-3-instinct-e-amazfit-ces-fun.html\">FIT File: Garmin Instinct 3…Let’s Chat</a><br />\n<strong>Tuesday:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/garmin-instinct3-vs-garmin-fenix8-very-detailed-review.html\">Garmin Instinct 3 vs Garmin Fenix 8: Every Difference Detailed!</a><br />\n<strong>Thursday:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/garmin-ecg-now-available-in-eu-australia.html\">Garmin ECG Now Available in EU (But not Fenix 7 Pro &amp; Epix Pro)</a></p>\n<p>Stay tuned for the final Instinct 3 review this week, following me putting it through the paces the past few weeks, including a <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/13364754057\">60KM trek this past Wednesday</a>. Atop that, there’s a smattering of smaller company news I want to catch up on, and one moderately-sized announcement this week coming up. Maybe more, who knows.</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Sports Tech Deals:</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Some new ones have popped up this past week. I think the Fenix 7 at $429 is probably the most interesting for people eyeing that new Instinct 3, since this is basically cheaper while having more features. I’ll continue sweeping and adding in a few more of these later tonight, so keep checking back.</p>\n<table>\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th></th><th><span>Product</span></th><th><span>Sale Price</span></th><th><span>Amazon</span></th><th><span>Other site</span></th><th><span>Sale Notes</span></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2020/05/garmin-rtl515-cycling.html\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"147\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/04/Garmin-varia-RTL510-transparent-200x147.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/04/Garmin-varia-RTL510-transparent-200x147.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/04/Garmin-varia-RTL510-transparent-720x528.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/04/Garmin-varia-RTL510-transparent-125x92.png 125w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2018/04/Garmin-varia-RTL510-transparent.png 750w\" /></a></td><td><a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2020/05/garmin-rtl515-cycling.html\" target=\"_blank\">Garmin Varia Radar (RTL515) - $50 off</a></td><td>$149</td><td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086TVFX1D/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=deviceaccessories-20&amp;linkId=51d1e5ac668ef03bf866d7f666bb3666&amp;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></td><td><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=7128e6e8-6ace-426f-80ef-177cd2ef6051&amp;url=https://www.rei.com/product/182344/garmin-varia-rtl515-rearview-radar-taillight\" target=\"_blank\">REI</a></td><td>This is Garmin's standalone radar+taillight option, and $149 is pretty much the standard sale-price.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Note that all of the above are Amazon affiliate links, which do help support the site.

As one who has had an e-bike battery stolen (which in this case ran about 800EUR), everything about the situation sucks.</p>\n<p><strong>2) <a href=\"https://coros.com/stories/latest-news/c/january-2025\">COROS Feature Updates January 2025:</a></strong> I’m a sucker for anything to do with sensors, and COROS allowing you to rename sensors in their latest update is A-OK with me. They’ve also added both during and post-workout sensor low-battery alerts. As well as a few other items.</p>\n<p><strong>3) <a href=\"https://zwiftinsider.com/route-time-estimates-updated/\">Zwift Rolls Out Personalized Route Time Estimates:</a></strong> I thought this was kinda cool, if for no other reason than my wife was asking for the feature the night prior, and boom, it magically appeared.</p>\n<p><strong>4) <a href=\"https://www.pelobuddy.com/more-beta-testing-game/?\">Peloton continues to test Zwift-like game in private beta:</a></strong> Will be super interesting to see where this lands. Keeping in mind, during one of the big layoff rounds, Zwift let go of one of their lead engineers…who was quickly scooped up by Peloton.</p>\n<p><strong>5) <a href=\"https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2024/09/19/bankruptcy-court-approves-giant%E2%80%99s-purchase-stages\">Bankruptcy judge approves Giant’s purchase of Stages:</a></strong> In the list of “things that are no surprise”, this continues to move forward. It’ll be interesting to see which product categories Giant ultimately continues. I’d imagine they’d ditch bike computers, though perhaps there’s a market for them within Asia. And I’d imagine they’ll probably exit the consumer indoor bike scene, though certainly keep up on the gym side.</p>\n<p><strong>6) <a href=\"https://escapecollective.com/threaded-31-assembling-a-minimalist-travel-sized-tool-kit/\">Assembling a minimalist travel-sized bike tool kit:</a> </strong>As always, Dave Rome’s gonna cost me a lot of money. Sigh.</p>\n<p><strong>7) <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Controller-Takeoff-Intelligent-Batteries/dp/B07FTJ8RXY?crid=N6FZ8EAT1IWV&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.5HJbxWy2OOD-SqJm9hvOofxU1Q1XNb_sgmL0m1r6B_IE7ljon1UpqZbHtgfHOjPXuY92b-R7a0AyBImsylcGOe_EjXsEidGZPppo-W4sOUSfrDGTKBOJFClJuJ0D_fP0iXjlQ_gYFoRpE7vUtss1wzU2AzqKSTSXspql69jqeQQ9s_a5qjcLR8FA9gkcH9HhlmMKwYhvQpKdh5QQv2HGNXKMU7q6tUkWJdRA3DQ4mV2kz1pZSs_SXxrsfxmpUDyHpfblv8JrcWoumuIPArfck2KdPVdwNEwAYk3Z7AoqdOY.lTrZU7iyG32FsA9EkeExT0z_H9uvCp3LTWhNUYoZW0I&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=DJI%2BFlip&amp;qid=1737298599&amp;sprefix=dji%2Bfli%2Caps%2C247&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=cb233ce56750c5dea50dd40446beb90f&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">DJI Flip announced:</a> </strong>I’ve ordered one, but it doesn’t arrive till tomorrow. No idea why DHL decided to take nearly a week to get from Amsterdam to Mallorca, but…I guess such is island life. I’ll be putting it through its sports-focused paces as usual. That said, I’m still a bit skeptical of the new design, in terms of travel compactness compared to the Mini 4 Pro (or inversely, the NEO). Seems a bit like a NEO Pro or Mini 5 Pro would have been a better fit for most people.</p>\n<p><strong>8) <a href=\"https://blog.stryd.com/2025/01/16/new-feature-convert-pace-based-workouts-from-trainingpeaks-and-final-surge-to-power/\">Stryd converts TrainingPeaks &amp; Final Surge Pace-based workouts to Power workouts:</a> </strong>This is actually pretty interesting. Essentially, if you’ve got a coach (or otherwise) creating pace-based workouts in TrainingPeaks or Final Surge, then Stryd will automatically convert those targets to be running power targets. While I’m kinda skeptical on the business viability of Stryd in the medium to long term, I do think this is a pretty useful feature for users of their device. Kudos.</p>\n<p>–</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for reading!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"d974cef9081142921c70bdd2a61ab5aa51dbfefad1c2fa171238b5fcd878f9e7","category":"Cycling"}
