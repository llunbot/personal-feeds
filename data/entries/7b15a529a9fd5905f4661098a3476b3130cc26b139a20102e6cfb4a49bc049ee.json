Per our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/09/apple-acquired-mayday-labs/\">report</a> earlier this month, the Canadian startup had developed an AI-powered calendar app that automatically scheduled events and tasks at optimal times.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMayday's features included a \"Calendar Shield\" that blocked overbooked schedules and AI-powered task scheduling that would suggest ideal focus times. The app could also identify scheduling conflicts and provide rescheduling recommendations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Mayday app was shuttered shortly after the acquisition, suggesting the startup's AI capabilities could surface within Apple's own Calendar app under the Apple Intelligence umbrella.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOver a year has passed since the acquisition, so perhaps some of these changes will debut as early as iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16, which will be unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC next month.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/23/apple-calendar-app-job-posting/\">Apple Calendar App Revamp Confirmed by Job Posting</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-calendar-app-revamp-confirmed-by-job-posting.2457548/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7b15a529a9fd5905f4661098a3476b3130cc26b139a20102e6cfb4a49bc049ee","category":"Apple"}
