Google claims that the largest version of Gemini exceeds \"current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely used academic benchmarks used in large language model (LLM) research and development.\" It's a follow-up to PaLM 2, an earlier AI model <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/googles-top-ai-model-palm-2-hopes-to-upstage-gpt-4-in-generative-mastery/\">that Google hoped would match</a> GPT-4 in capability.</p>\n<p>A specially tuned English version of its mid-level Gemini model is <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-try-gemini-ai/\">available now</a> in over 170 countries as part of the Google Bard chatbot—although not in the EU or the UK <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/06/1084471/google-deepminds-new-gemini-model-looks-amazing-but-could-signal-peak-ai-hype/\">due to</a> potential regulation issues.</p>\n\n<p>Like GPT-4, Gemini can handle multiple types (or \"modes\") of input, making it multimodal. That means it can process text, code, images, and even audio. The goal is to make a type of artificial intelligence that can accurately solve problems, give advice, and answer questions in various fields—from the mundane to the scientific. Google says this will power a new era in computing, and it hopes to tightly integrate the technology into its products.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989030#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989030&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a0176efacefd5c8d5911a9b8a3acae8ec83684aa257e7f404c52b365f41daa24","category":"Tech"}
