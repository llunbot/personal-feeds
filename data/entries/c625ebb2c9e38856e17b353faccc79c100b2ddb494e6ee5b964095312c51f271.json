A photo the Water Authority provided to news outlets showed the front panel of a programmable logic controller—a toaster-sized box often abbreviated as PLC that’s used to automate physical processes inside of industrial settings—that displayed an anti-Israeli message. The PLC bore the logo of the manufacturer Unitronics. A sign above it read “Primary PLC.”</p>\n<h2>WWS facilities in the crosshairs</h2>\n<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Administration on Tuesday published an <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/11/28/exploitation-unitronics-plcs-used-water-and-wastewater-systems\">advisory</a> that warned of recent attacks compromising Unitronics PLCs used in Water and Wastewater Systems, which are often abbreviated as WWSes. Although the notice didn’t identify any facilities by name, the account of one hack was almost identical to the one that occurred inside the Aliquippa facility.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987313#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987313&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c625ebb2c9e38856e17b353faccc79c100b2ddb494e6ee5b964095312c51f271","category":"Tech"}
