A second division in women’s cycling, the ProTour, is being introduced from next year, with minimum salaries a requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Our aim has always been to progress to ProTeam level and ultimately become a WorldTour team. With uncertainty surrounding the viability of the project at Continental level, we no longer have the appetite to struggle to deliver our professional vision on a minimum budget at this largely unregulated level.’</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"606\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/lifeplus-wahoo-970x606.jpeg\" alt=\"group of cyclists stand arm in arm in front of advertising hoarding\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/lifeplus-wahoo-970x606.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/lifeplus-wahoo-300x188.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/lifeplus-wahoo-768x480.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/lifeplus-wahoo-1536x960.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/lifeplus-wahoo-2048x1280.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/lifeplus-wahoo-750x469.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/lifeplus-wahoo-1140x713.jpeg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Lifeplus-Wahoo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lifeplus-Wahoo was founded in 2015 and has been a home for riders such as <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/joss-lowden-dan-bigham-cyclist-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Joss Lowden</a>, who set the women’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">Hour record</a> in September 2021, and has helped many riders to the WorldTour including Ella Wyllie to Jayco-AlUla in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team have faced sponsor issues in the past, previously turning to crowdfunding before the 2019 season after a title sponsor pulled out. A sponsor also backed out just prior to the 2023 season, leaving a budget shortage of around €400,000, meaning riders were told to look for other deals. Holistic wellness brand Lifeplus then joined as lead co-sponsor for 2023 and 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, the squad experienced a theft of all 14 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ribble-endurance-slr-disc-review\" target=\"_blank\">Ribble Endurance SLR</a> bikes from their mechanic’s van after Stage 1 of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-women-2024-photos\" target=\"_blank\">Tour of Britain Women</a>. Other teams came to their aid with spare bikes for Stage 2 before replacements could be sent by Ribble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This now leaves only five British UCI Continental women’s teams: Alba Development Road Team; DAS-Hutchinson-Brother UK; Dolticini-O’Shea; Hess Cycling Team; and Pro-Noctis-200° Coffee-Hargreaves Contracting.  </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-women-2024-photos\">The best photos from the Tour of Britain Women 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/le-col-wahoo-women-s-tour\">Behind the scenes with Le Col-Wahoo at the Women’s Tour</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\">Tour de France Femmes 2024: Route, start list, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/lifeplus-wahoo-folding\">Lifeplus-Wahoo women’s team to fold at the end of 2024</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"170abf1447ba9232bf4539b590b3375f422afe83ffec20c192e61bbb67fcd7b7","category":"Cycling"}
