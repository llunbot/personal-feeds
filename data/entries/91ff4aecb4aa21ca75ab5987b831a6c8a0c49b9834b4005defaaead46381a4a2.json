Although it almost looks smaller than ever without seeing a conventional fork arch up front, this is undeniably a highly capable cross-country fork. Combining a new level of stiffness with an almost silly amount of apparent weight loss vs. the already light original 32 SC, this new fork will be a killer option for ultralight hardtail or short-travel full-suspension XC bikes!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MY 2025 Fox 32 Step Cast XC fork: First Rides Review</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/All-new-Fox-32-SC-XC-fork_MY25-reverse-arch-100mm-29er-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_straight-into-the-rock-gardens.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/All-new-Fox-32-SC-XC-fork_MY25-reverse-arch-100mm-29er-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_straight-into-the-rock-gardens-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"First Rides on 2025 Fox 32 Step Cast ultralight 100mm XC fork with all-new reverse-arch, dropping in rock garden\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/All-new-Fox-32-SC-XC-fork_MY25-reverse-arch-100mm-29er-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_straight-into-the-rock-gardens-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/All-new-Fox-32-SC-XC-fork_MY25-reverse-arch-100mm-29er-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_straight-into-the-rock-gardens-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/All-new-Fox-32-SC-XC-fork_MY25-reverse-arch-100mm-29er-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_straight-into-the-rock-gardens-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/All-new-Fox-32-SC-XC-fork_MY25-reverse-arch-100mm-29er-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_straight-into-the-rock-gardens-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/All-new-Fox-32-SC-XC-fork_MY25-reverse-arch-100mm-29er-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_straight-into-the-rock-gardens-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/All-new-Fox-32-SC-XC-fork_MY25-reverse-arch-100mm-29er-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_straight-into-the-rock-gardens-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/All-new-Fox-32-SC-XC-fork_MY25-reverse-arch-100mm-29er-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_straight-into-the-rock-gardens.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>(Ride Photos/Pinarello)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I said I’ll try to be brief.* </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since I really only managed to squeeze in two solid rides on the new Fox 32 Step Cast cross-country fork, mounted to the same all-new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-pinarello-dogma-xc-drops-2-carbon-specs-for-full-suspension-hard-tail-mtbs/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinarello Dogma XC</a> full-suspension race bike that Tom Pidcock raced to a 2023 XCO World Championship win. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>*<em>But readers who recognize my byline might not be so easily convinced.

I rode it on the 11th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s mostly unique in that it replaces the conventional forward-facing fork brace with a reverse arch design. That reverse arch is also composed of an open web said to maximize stiffness with limited material.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Fox 32 SC fork is 29er only and limited to 100mm of travel – for XC, marathon, and ultra-distance racing. But it also happens to have shed more than one hundred grams over the previous generation, even when that weight was for the 27.5 version. And at a claimed 1287g now, it has reclaimed the title of lightest XC suspension fork back from the RockShox <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021-rockshox-sid-sl-is-lightest-ever-plus-sid-ultimate-goes-to-120mm-w-new-sid-luxe-rear-shock/\" target=\"_blank\">SID SL</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Into the weeds</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_unique-open-spider-web-reverse-arch-brace.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_unique-open-spider-web-reverse-arch-brace-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"MY25 Fox 32 SC 100mm XC fork: Review, open spider web reverse crown\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_unique-open-spider-web-reverse-arch-brace-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_unique-open-spider-web-reverse-arch-brace-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_unique-open-spider-web-reverse-arch-brace-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_unique-open-spider-web-reverse-arch-brace-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_unique-open-spider-web-reverse-arch-brace-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_unique-open-spider-web-reverse-arch-brace-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_unique-open-spider-web-reverse-arch-brace.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That open reverse arch is all about increasing stiffness – lowering the arch and balancing the axle offset on the opposite side of the lowers. These new cast magnesium lowers are in fact a couple grams heavier, not in fact lighter than the old lowers. But Fox claims they are significantly stiffer compared to the old 32 Step Cast. The overall fork is said increase torsional stiffness by 40%, making it nearly as stiff as the 34 SC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fork’s weight savings are mostly hidden inside – the lighter damper, stanchion, steerer tube &amp; Kabolt SL thru-axle are said to save 97g. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, another 9g for the new zero offset crown that reduced cantilevered forces to become stiffer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Rides-Review_zero-offset-crown.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Rides-Review_zero-offset-crown-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"MY25 Fox 32 Step Cast 100mm XC fork: Review, zero offset crown\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Rides-Review_zero-offset-crown-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Rides-Review_zero-offset-crown-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Rides-Review_zero-offset-crown-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Rides-Review_zero-offset-crown-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Rides-Review_zero-offset-crown-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Rides-Review_zero-offset-crown.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of having the stanchions in line with the headtube angle, this new crown angles or can’t the telescoping elements of the fork more in line with the forces coming in from the axle. It looks a bit odd with no offset at the crown. But means improved stiffness with less weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fox does say this solution is limited to shorter travel fork loads. So even though it seems logical, we don’t expect to see it on many more forks in the short term.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-lowers.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-lowers-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"MY25 Fox 32 SC 100mm XC fork: Review, Step Cast lowers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-lowers-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-lowers-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-lowers-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-lowers-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-lowers-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-lowers-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-lowers.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It still uses a Step Cast design towards the axle to save weight.

I tried to figure on almost 25% sag, knowing that I had a remote mechanical lockout if I felt the fork was too soft. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s quite a bit more sag than the stiff 15-20% that Fox recommends. But I wasn’t going to be racing, so I wanted to be sure to use the travel.

Fox describes the new ultralight fork as the “<em>Absolute Lightest in XC. Made for Marathon.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, a lot of XC racers have moved up to 120mm of travel to tackle the more technical tracks. So 100mm of lightweight travel is maybe not quite enough for the high race-pace speeds of the World Cup XCO circuit. But I’m pretty sure that I’m not attacking climbs and descents anywhere near the likes of Tom Pidcock on this bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while I love long-travel mountain bikes, 100mm on an XC bike is probably enough for most of us. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_fast-and-loose-in-the-gravel.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"922\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_fast-and-loose-in-the-gravel-1536x922.jpg\" alt=\"First Rides on 2025 Fox 32 Step Cast ultralight 100mm XC fork with all-new reverse-arch, loose gravel downhill\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_fast-and-loose-in-the-gravel-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_fast-and-loose-in-the-gravel-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_fast-and-loose-in-the-gravel-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_fast-and-loose-in-the-gravel-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2025-Fox-32-SC-XC-100mm-fork_all-new-reverse-arch-Step-Cast-cross-country-suspension_First-Ride_photo-by-Pinarello_fast-and-loose-in-the-gravel.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even blasting down slabs of rock, drifting through gravel-strewn forest roads at probably too high speed, and smashing though rock gardens as fast as I felt comfortable, it was probably lightweight 2.4″ XC tires with tiny tread knobs that felt like my limiting factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I never felt lacking of travel or stiffness on my two fast rides.
