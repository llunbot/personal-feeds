Although a runner and occasional cyclist in her youth, the 29-year-old suffered a mental health breakdown during Covid lockdown in 2020 that prompted her husband to buy her a bike. It kickstarted what has become a transformative quest for ever more impressive endurance challenges, and the publication of her book, Finding Happiness Pedal by Pedal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In covering nearly 30,000km on her Pinarello X7 in the past 18 months, Amy’s cycling adventures have written a new chapter in her life, and the story she tells is a perfect encapsulation of not only why we ride, but also what we can achieve by doing so.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How it started </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was a mental health nurse for three years, working with adolescents with eating disorders. I’ve always been an anxious person, but when Covid hit and I was working from home, all my appointments with young people were just on screens and I didn’t have that opportunity after appointments to debrief with my team.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-2-728x970.webp\" alt=\"Pinarello focus Amy Hudson\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-2-728x970.webp 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-2-225x300.webp 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-2-768x1024.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-2-1152x1536.webp 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-2-750x1000.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-2-1140x1520.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-2.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I’d just sit at home alone, worrying about whether I’d said the right thing or that something bad was going to happen. I became trapped in a spiral of negative thoughts. I knew I wasn’t in a good place but didn’t want to tell anyone. I was struggling to sleep and eat, and eventually I just broke down in front of my husband, Kyle. He then randomly bought me a bike – I hadn’t asked for one, in fact I hadn’t ridden for ten years.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pushing the limits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When I was young my dad would always drag us kids out on our bikes, so it was fitting that the first ride on my new bike was with him, although it was a challenge – a 70km ride with 1,500m of climbing. Even on that first ride I found myself recognising that I wasn’t thinking of my worries, I was just concentrating on my breathing. It was the first time in a long time that I felt calm, a bit more like myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘In August 2021 I rode the 250km home to Derby from our holiday caravan in Wales. Then Kyle suggested we ride the North Coast 500 a month later. My bike was so overloaded that the front wheel was lifting off the ground, and I did the ride – averaging about 100km a day – in gym leggings and with flat pedals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘A lot has changed since then. In 2023 I rode Paris-Brest-Paris, which was 1,200km with a 90-hour time limit. It was an unforgettable experience, especially since I had saddle sores that brought me to tears after just 400km. Last year I did All Points North, a solo 1,000km ride with a 72-hour cut-off. I slept outdoors – in a graveyard and a bus shelter. Also last year, Kyle and I rode to the Pinarello store on Regent’s Street in London from the Pinarello factory in Italy.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-3-728x970.webp\" alt=\"Pinarello focus Amy Hudson\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-3-728x970.webp 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-3-225x300.webp 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-3-768x1024.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-3-1152x1536.webp 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-3-750x1000.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-3-1140x1520.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/pinarello-amy-hudson-3.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Tour de force</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘My 2025 challenge is to cycle every stage of the men’s Tour de France, plus the transfers between them, to raise money for the mental health charity Shout (giveusashout.org), which is a free, 24/7 text messaging service for anyone who’s struggling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was originally going to try to complete it in the same timeframe as the pros, but when they released the route I saw there were 3,000km of transfers involved. So I’m starting a week before the pros and aiming to finish the day before them. It’ll be 30 days in total and I’m going to give myself two rest days, partly for bike maintenance and partly because I’m definitely going to need some sort of rest at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s about 6,300km of riding altogether, with Kyle supporting me from a car, mainly with snacks. It’s his 30th birthday on the day I ride Mont Ventoux so he’s going to bring his bike and ride the climb with me as a birthday present to himself.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Powered by Pinarello</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I have a totally standard Pinarello X7, which I did All Points North on and rode back from Italy on. It was certainly handy for getting up the climbs on that ride, and its endurance-focussed geometry means it’s really comfy too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s so helpful for me as a long-distance rider, because you’re not sitting up so high that you lose the aero, but it’s not too far forward that it’s uncomfortable. I even rode it to a silver medal in the RTTC National 24 Hour Championships last year, riding 648km in 24 hours.’</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/pinarello-amy-hudson\">Pinarello focus: Inspiration and perspiration</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"adb641a9a577cda820773d675b080f699544f6af2e538f732d9521f4493bdd00","category":"Cycling"}
