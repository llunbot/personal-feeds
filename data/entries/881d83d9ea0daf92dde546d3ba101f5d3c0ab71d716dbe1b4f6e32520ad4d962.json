Notably, he said the updated 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M4 chip will be announced \"earlier\" than those other devices, but he did not provide a specific timeframe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis likely means that the updated MacBook Air models will be announced in a press release on the Apple Newsroom website at some point from January through March, whereas the other devices might be announced at Apple's usual spring event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple earlier this month released macOS 15.2, and in doing so it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/macos-sequoia-15-2-m4-macbook-air-leak/\">accidentally confirmed new MacBook Air models</a> coming next year. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo major design changes have been rumored for the next MacBook Air, with only the M4 chip and other minor upgrades expected. Plausible new features could include a Center Stage camera, and an upgrade from Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 4 ports.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple already updated the MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini with M4 chip options a few months ago. Geekbench results showed that the M4 chip is up to around <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/m4-mac-chip-benchmarks/\">25% faster than the M3 chip</a> in terms of multi-core CPU performance.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/23/macbook-air-with-m4-chip-launch-timing/\">New MacBook Air Models With M4 Chip Expected to Launch 'Earlier' Than iPhone SE 4 and iPad 11</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-macbook-air-models-with-m4-chip-expected-to-launch-earlier-than-iphone-se-4-and-ipad-11.2446002/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"881d83d9ea0daf92dde546d3ba101f5d3c0ab71d716dbe1b4f6e32520ad4d962","category":"Apple"}
