Rogers represents a California district known for its Bigfoot sightings (or \"sightings,\" depending on your persuasion—many of these <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-dec-06-me-wallace6-story.html\">have been faked</a>), and he wants to make Bigfoot the \"official cryptid\" of the state.</p>\n<p>His bill notes that California already has <a href=\"https://www.library.ca.gov/california-history/state-symbols/\">many official symbols</a>, including the golden poppy (official flower), the California redwood (official tree), the word \"Eureka\" (official motto), the red-legged frog (official amphibian), the grizzly bear (official animal), swing dancing (official dance), and the saber-toothed cat (official fossil). The state has so many of these that there are separate categories for freshwater fish (golden trout) and marine fish (garibaldi). So why not, Rogers wants to know, \"designate Bigfoot as the official state cryptid\"?</p>\n<p>That's... pretty much the bill, which was introduced this week and already has Bigfoot advocates excited. SFGate <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/northcoast/article/california-takes-steps-toward-officially-20175812.php\">talked to Matt Moneymaker</a>, who it describes as \"a longtime Bigfoot researcher and former star of the Animal Planet series <em>Finding Bigfoot</em>,\" about the bill. Moneymaker loves it, noting that he has personally “had a face-to-face encounter one time, after which I was absolutely sure they existed because I had one about 20 feet in front of me, growling at me.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/under-new-bill-bigfoot-could-become-californias-official-cryptid/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/under-new-bill-bigfoot-could-become-californias-official-cryptid/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3ea3cf0938c1edd3ead75c5681ab0a7ef10bf39885b2fe7381f0addc43132c99","category":"Tech"}
