The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/03/despite-turbulence-at-boeing-astronauts-are-ready-to-fly-companys-starliner/\">Starliner Crew Flight Test (CFT) next month</a> will wrap up a decade and a half of development and, if all goes well, will pave the way for operational Starliner missions to ferry crews to and from the space station.</p>\n<p>Starliner is running years behind schedule and over budget. SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft has flown all of NASA's crew rotation missions to the station since its first astronaut flight in 2020. But NASA wants to get Boeing's spacecraft up and running to have a backup to SpaceX. It would then alternate between Starliner and Crew Dragon for six-month expeditions to the station beginning next year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017841#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017841&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8ec85aa60360120f3eb62be72e8e981e2ac49c1f83ad5ea8f5663f0822df889f","category":"Tech"}
