He\nreferred to the Wall Street Journal story earlier this week that\nsaid Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick knew of sexual\nharassment at the company for years and that he mistreated women.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is about as close as Microsoft could come at this point to calling for Kotick to resign.
