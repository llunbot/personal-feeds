Apple is usually excellent in this area, often keeping older generations of its products on the latest versions of the operating system or at least blessed with security updates to keep them safe. But there comes a time when the software on an iPad can no longer be updated to a secure version of iPadOS, and when that happens you may find that apps and services will no longer work and your data could be at risk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a quick guide to how long you should expect an iPad to remain usable. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which versions of iPadOS does Apple support?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The crucial thing is whether Apple will update the operating system software that runs on your iPad if it discovers a security flaw. While Apple only issues updates with new features for the current version of the iPadOS, it does issue security updates to older versions of iPadOS to keep older iPads secure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security updates are released relatively frequently and simply update the code in the system to close any potential areas where hackers or malware could gain access. These appear on your device as “point” releases, such as iPadOS 17.1, 17.1.1, 17.2, etc., and they make small adjustments to iPadOS and fix any security issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that the real defining element of how long an iPad can last is security updates. Once those stop, it’s not advisable to continue using the device, as it could be vulnerable. Generally, Apple issues security updates for two generations after ending support for the latest version. For example, when iPadOS 17 arrived in 2023, Apple still issued updates for iPadOS 16 and 15 throughout the year. With iPadOS 18, Apple is expected to stop issuing regular security updates for iPadOS 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally, Apple will issue updates for older models, such as an iOS 12 update (before Apple split iOS and iPadOS) in January 2023.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPadOs 18 overview\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>iPadOS 18<span> </span></p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPadOs 18 overview\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>iPadOS 18<span> </span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPadOs 18 overview\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ipados_18_overview.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>iPadOS 18<span> </span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which version of iPadOS can I run?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is to know which version of iPadOS your iPad can run, that way you can identify whether Apple is still committed to updating it with security-related fixes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 12 </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This old version of iOS ran on various iPads as well as the iPhone, including: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad Air (1st generation) – from 2013</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini (2nd and 3rd generation) – from 2013</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple issued a security update in January 2023.

That includes these models:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad Air (2nd gen and earlier)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad (4th gen and earlier)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini (4th gen and earlier)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which iPads are supported with full updates?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the launch of iPadOS 18, these are the iPads that will get the latest version:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad Pro (M4)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd gen and later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Pro 11-inch</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Air (M2)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Air (3rd gen and later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad (7th gen and later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Mini (5th gen and later)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How long does Apple support iPads with security updates?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The oldest model Apple makes that is still able to install iPadOS 18 is from 2018. Assuming those models are dropped next year, that will be nearly seven years of support for a full version and nine years of security updates. Apple will also occasionally push updates to older iPads, though it’s very rare and only in extreme cases. However, when buying an iPad, you can assume between eight and 10 years of security updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How long does Apple support iPads for repair?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, Apple moves devices onto the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624\" target=\"_blank\">Vintage list</a> between five and seven years after it stops selling them. Around seven years after Apple stops selling a product it is moved into the Obsolete list, though some countries have different rules. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once considered Vintage by Apple, your chance of being able to get replacement parts is difficult, but when a product is Obsolete you will not be able to get replacement parts. Therefore if it has been five years since Apple stopped selling an iPad you are unlikely to be able to get replacement parts if something goes wrong. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The products considered vintage and obsolete are listed below. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vintage iPads </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad Air 2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini 2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Pro 9.7-inch (1st gen)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st gen)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad (5th gen) </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Obsolete iPads</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad Air (1st gen)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini (3rd gen and earlier)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad (4th gen and earlier)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How long should an iPad last?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the software side of things, it seems from the current examples laid out above that you can expect software security support up to nine years from when an iPad went on sale, however, we wouldn’t count on that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Apple doesn’t consider a product vintage until five years after it stopped selling it, you can expect at least six years of support (assuming the product was sold for a year, though Apple often sells products for much longer than that).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, hardware is the other side of the equation and that can be more random as parts deteriorate or fail. Say your battery life falls off a cliff, you’ll need to still be within your one-year warranty period to have it repaired for free. Apple does have a battery replacement service though, usually costing $99/£99 for a replacement and fitting, so this could prolong the hardware side of things for a good while (essentially up until it was moved to the vintage list five years after Apple stopped selling it). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple offers hardware servicing and parts for a range of older iPads, all at a cost of course. On its <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201624\" target=\"_blank\">site</a>, the company states, “Owners of iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac or Apple TV products may obtain service and parts from Apple service providers, including Apple Store locations and Independent Repair Providers, for a minimum of 5 years from when Apple last distributed the product for sale”. This is clarified later in the text, saying that you can get iPads repaired up to seven years after they were last on sale from Apple. So, if you want to know if your iPad qualifies, simply Google when it was discontinued by Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, a 10-year-old iPad is an impressive feat of durability, but it won’t be as fun or powerful as a new one.
