The new helmet has achieved a five star rating from the independent <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/safest-bike-helmet\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Tech Helmet Testing lab</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/lazer-kineticore\" target=\"_blank\">Lazer’s KinetiCore</a> works by removing blocks from the helmet’s EPS foam lining. The remaining foam acts as a controlled crumple zone in an accident, helping to dissipate rotational forces. Since it removes material, KinetiCore has the additional benefits of using less polystyrene plastic and reducing the helmet’s weight, with Lazer claiming that a size medium weighs 220g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new design comes in seven colours and is available now for £229.99 / $249.99 / €249.99.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

popular designs, so the brand says it aims to extend the success of the design with this update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The Z1 was in need of a refresh because its premise is perfectly suited to the benefits of our KinetiCore technology, which not only adds rotational impact protection but decreases weight,’ says Lazer’s Jonathan Jacobs. ‘As the Z1 has always been light, this was a great opportunity to shed more weight, which we did to the tune of around 40g.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The switch from Mips to KinetiCore was the primary driver behind the Z1’s weight reduction, but Jacobs says Lazer has also lowered the density of the EPS foam used in the helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The bridges (which are more tightly rounded in the new model) and ribs come together in the new helmet to create a cage-like structure,’ he says. ‘This makes them stiffer at the same weight, therefore we could afford to drop the density without losing the integrity/safety of the material.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sharpened shell profile, which includes those subtle changes to the shapes of the ribs and the cross-bridges, is said to allow best in class ventilation while still keeping the new Z1 aerodynamic. Jacobs says the new Z1 is four seconds faster per 10km at 44kmh than the old design – we’re assuming by that he means four seconds faster when riding at the watts previously required to go 44kmh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The new shape provides a better path for the air to enter and exit the helmet,’ says Jacobs. ‘When they are placed well, air can move without disturbance inside the helmet and then exit cleanly. This will cause the head to be cooled more efficiently. The bridges have a different incline on the new Z1 so that they are optimal in ventilation when riding. When you are on your race bike your head is tilted forward. If you look at the front of the helmet when tilted, you will see that there is more open space for airflow coming through between the bridges.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is supported by a ‘floating headband’, which creates a gap between the helmet shell and the rider’s head to further encourage airflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finer fit</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Aeroshell-Stelvio-69-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"New Lazer Z1 helmet\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Aeroshell-Stelvio-69-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Aeroshell-Stelvio-69-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Aeroshell-Stelvio-69-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Aeroshell-Stelvio-69-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Aeroshell-Stelvio-69-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Aeroshell-Stelvio-69-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Aeroshell-Stelvio-69-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Aeroshell-Stelvio-69-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Aeroshell-Stelvio-69-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Lazer-Z1-Aeroshell-Stelvio-69-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Lazer</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lazer has also upgraded its Advanced RollSys fit system, with a new design to the thumbwheel on the top of the helmet, which tightens the cradle around the entire head circumference. A benefit of the positioning of the RollSys adjuster is that, unlike a dial at the rear, it shouldn’t interfere with longer hair or a ponytail. A derivation of this retention mechanism, Scrollsys, was used on Lazer’s Vento aero helmet, but it was not chosen for the new Z1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Scrollsys is too big and heavy for the Z1 model,’ says Jacobs. ‘We had to make a choice between aero and weight and weight got the upper hand for this model so we went for the Advanced RollSys. Advanced RollSys turns smoother and is easier to tighten than the previous version. The little teeth on the wheel have a new design like shark teeth, so when you tighten your helmet, you hook behind the teeth. Opening again goes as smooth as before though.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More eco benefits are claimed from the new straps, which are made from lightweight, antibacterial recycled material. Lazer has also abandoned its plastic strap divider in the new design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with many of Lazer’s other helmets, you can buy an aeroshell that clips over the helmet, upping your aero quotient, as well as protecting your head from the rain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lazer is offering the new Z1 in seven colours, ranging from black through greys and muted blues to white and red. If you want to add an aeroshell, you can have it in black or red. The helmet is also compatible with Lazer’s LED rear light.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lazer Z1 KinetiCore helmet specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/MY2024_Z1_Flash_Orange_LEFT-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"New Lazer Z1 helmet\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/MY2024_Z1_Flash_Orange_LEFT-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/MY2024_Z1_Flash_Orange_LEFT-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/MY2024_Z1_Flash_Orange_LEFT-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/MY2024_Z1_Flash_Orange_LEFT-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/MY2024_Z1_Flash_Orange_LEFT-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/MY2024_Z1_Flash_Orange_LEFT-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/MY2024_Z1_Flash_Orange_LEFT-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/MY2024_Z1_Flash_Orange_LEFT-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/MY2024_Z1_Flash_Orange_LEFT-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/MY2024_Z1_Flash_Orange_LEFT-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Lazer</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sizes:</strong> S, M, L</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Claimed weight:</strong> 220g (size M)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Colours</strong>: 7</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price</strong>: £229.99 / $249.99 / €249.99</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/lazer-z1-kineticore-helmet\">Lazer updates its Z1 helmet with KinetiCore rotational impact protection</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"cc48cc81abb1ed382e475a2da7706a0cb9eaac180ceef6c4ad492e7087c08d96","category":"Cycling"}
