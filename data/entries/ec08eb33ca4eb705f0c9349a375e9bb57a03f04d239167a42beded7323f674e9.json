It remains a matter of debate in the archeological community, but a fresh analysis of the physical properties of the glass-like material found in the remains lends more evidence to the hypothesis, as detailed in a new paper published in the journal Scientific Reports.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/archaeologists-find-evidence-of-neurons-in-glassy-brain-of-vesuvius-victim/\">previously reported</a>, the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius released thermal energy roughly equivalent to 100,000 times the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II, spewing molten rock, pumice, and hot ash over the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum in particular. The vast majority of the victims died of asphyxiation, choking to death on the thick clouds of noxious gas and ash.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/35071167\">a 2001 study</a> in Nature, co-authored by Italian archaeologist Pier Paolo Petrone, estimated a temperature of 500° Celsius (932° Fahrenheit) for the pyroclastic surge that destroyed Pompeii, sufficient to kill inhabitants in fractions of a second. Back in 2018, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/extreme-heat-of-vesuvius-eruption-vaporized-body-fluids-exploded-skulls/\">we reported</a> on Petrone's conclusion that inhabitants of Herculaneum may have suffered a similar fate. There was fracturing in the bones and \"cracking and explosion\" of the skullcaps, consistent with forensic cases where skulls burst from extreme heat.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/study-hot-vesuvian-ash-cloud-really-did-turn-a-brain-to-glass/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/study-hot-vesuvian-ash-cloud-really-did-turn-a-brain-to-glass/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ec08eb33ca4eb705f0c9349a375e9bb57a03f04d239167a42beded7323f674e9","category":"Tech"}
