But the Patagonia Refugio Daypack 26L is great for anyone who’s always on the go, whether it’s for work or play. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Made entirely from recycled polyester (it does not contain any perfluorinated chemicals), the Refugio Daypack 26L has good waterproofing for outdoor use on hikes or a bike trip. The back padding is well thought out and offers an air channel for the back, and the shoulder straps are also very comfortable and easy to adjust. It lacks a lap belt, but there is a height-adjustable chest strap, important to ensure a proper fit when running or cycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patagonia cleverly provides a separate, well-padded pouch that protects a laptop and has enough room for a 16-inch MacBook Pro. The pouch is removable and without the pouch, that space in the Refugio Daypack 26L is ideal for, say, a tennis racket. A strong Velcro fastener on the laptop pouch ensures protection even when the pouch is used alone. When inside the backpack, the laptop pouch is secured via a Velcro loop in the rear compartment of the backpack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Refugio Daypack 26L has a total capacity of 26 liters, divided into three compartments. The main compartment is very spacious. It can either hold a folder with books, or even a pair of shoes and a change of clothes. A large mesh pocket in the backpack offers enough space for pens, cables, and a USB-C hub.  The small compartment on the front is ideal for handkerchiefs, keys, or other small items. There are mesh compartments for water bottles on both sides. Patagonia has also provided several loops, one of which is can be used for a rear bike light.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"Patagonia Refugio Daypack 26L \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Patagonia_RefugioDaypack_08.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>It even fits an Ikea box.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Patagonia Refugio Daypack 26L \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Refugio-Daypack-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Patagonia Refugio Daypack 26L \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Refugio-Daypack-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Patagonia Refugio Daypack 26L \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Patagonia_RefugioDaypack_05.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Also suitable as a sports bag, for example for tennis.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Patagonia Refugio Daypack 26L \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Refugio-Daypack-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Patagonia Refugio Daypack 26L \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Patagonia_RefugioDaypack_04.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Everything you need for your studies.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With its dimensions of 45 by 30.4 by 16.5 centimeters, the Refugio Daypack 26L is still compact and weighs just 735 grams. This is one thing we’d change about the backpack: use a harder, dark material for the base to protect it from wear and tear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the Patagonia Refugio Daypack 26L?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Patagonia is a brand known for being eco-conscience and it delivers a well-thought-out daypack with the Refugio Daypack. It covers a wide range of uses, so it makes compromises compared to specialized laptop backpacks. But whether for the office, hiking, shopping, or sports, the Refugio Daypack impresses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on </em><a href=\"https://www.macwelt.de/article/2322913/test-patagonia-refugio-daypack.html\"><em>Macwelt</em></a><em> and was translated by </em><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/rloyola\"><em>Roman Loyola</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"57b860fa035743e495cdd966f87cf8b083637e95ae7c5bcad8fe5069d7c72804","category":"Apple"}
