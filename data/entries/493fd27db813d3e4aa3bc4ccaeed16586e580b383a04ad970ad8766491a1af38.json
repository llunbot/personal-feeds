During the leadup to  <em>Unbound Gravel 2025</em>, eagle-eyed fans may have spotted what looks to be a brand-new Specialized Diverge, caked in Kansas mud and piloted by none other than<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/annika.langvad/?hl=en\"> Annika Langvad </a>and Geerike Schreurs — both Specialized-backed riders. And while the official line from Morgan Hill is radio silence, the “leak” feels just sanctioned enough to keep us watching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Let’s break down what we can see beneath the grime.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-side--e1748450443864.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1176\" height=\"1448\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-side--e1748450443864.webp\" alt=\"Unbound 2025 Spec Diverge side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-side--e1748450443864.webp 1176w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-side--e1748450443864-244x300.webp 244w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-side--e1748450443864-97x120.webp 97w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-side--e1748450443864-768x946.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(All of the photos in this post are screenshots from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/annika.langvad/?hl=en\">Annika Langvad’s </a>Instagram Story)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Familiar Shape, Fresh Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From a silhouette perspective, this new bike doesn’t reinvent the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-specialized-diverge-str-is-a-gravel-hover-bike/\">Diverge platform</a> — it refines it. The classic dropped seatstays are still present, and the overall stance echoes that of the current generation. But look closer, and you’ll spot some subtle reshaping:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A more sculpted head tube hints at aero ambitions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A sleeker seat tube and chainstay junction appear tightened and smoothed, likely to aid compliance and airflow.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-style--e1748450378335.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2104\" height=\"1179\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-style--e1748450378335.webp\" alt=\"Unbound 2025 Spec Diverge style\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-style--e1748450378335.webp 2104w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-style--e1748450378335-297x166.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-style--e1748450378335-1536x861.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-style--e1748450378335-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-style--e1748450378335-768x430.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-style--e1748450378335-2048x1148.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Future Shock Up Front — Again</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized’s Future Shock suspension is front and center, continuing the brand’s “smoother is faster” mantra. Whether it’s a new version of the current 3.0 spec from Roubaix is unclear. Still, placement and execution suggest the same travel and concept — isolating your hands from the buzz without compromising your fit or handling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonus points for the Roval Rapide aero bar on Langvad’s rig. That likely won’t be stock spec, but it does show that the Diverge is still being thought of as a high-performance machine, not just an adventure platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-recon--e1748450415424.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1179\" height=\"1977\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-recon--e1748450415424.webp\" alt=\"Unbound 2025 Spec Diverge recon\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-recon--e1748450415424.webp 1179w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-recon--e1748450415424-179x300.webp 179w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-recon--e1748450415424-72x120.webp 72w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-recon--e1748450415424-768x1288.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-recon--e1748450415424-916x1536.webp 916w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Internal Routing, With a Nod to Mechanics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, cables are routed internally — but <em>not</em> through the stem as seen in the less blurry photo above. Instead, they dive into the head tube externally after routing neatly from the center groove of the bar. That’s great news for home mechanics and racers on the road, especially those who don’t travel with a full-service pit crew.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-rear--e1748450468856.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1179\" height=\"1943\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-rear--e1748450468856.webp\" alt=\"Unbound 2025 Spec Diverge rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-rear--e1748450468856.webp 1179w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-rear--e1748450468856-182x300.webp 182w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-rear--e1748450468856-73x120.webp 73w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-rear--e1748450468856-768x1266.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-rear--e1748450468856-932x1536.webp 932w\" /></a><figcaption>Looks to be a cleaner, and possibly wireless-only frame. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>UDH Compatibility = Transmission-Ready</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM’s Universal Derailleur Hanger (UDH) is clearly in play here, which means this new Diverge can run SRAM’s Transmission groupsets — a big nod to modern drivetrain standards and futureproofing. We’re also seeing a traditional external seatpost clamp and a likely round seatpost, which keeps options open for dropper compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-IG--e1748450498715.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1179\" height=\"1260\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-IG--e1748450498715.webp\" alt=\"Unbound 2025 Spec Diverge IG\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-IG--e1748450498715.webp 1179w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-IG--e1748450498715-281x300.webp 281w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-IG--e1748450498715-112x120.webp 112w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-IG--e1748450498715-768x821.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tire Clearance? Still TBD</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This one’s tricky — with the Kansas mud hiding just about everything below the top of the tire. That said, clearance was a key limitation on the previous Diverge, with a maximum of 47mm. That was fine five years ago, but today’s all-road terrain demands more. The competition (Allied, Argon 18, Lauf) is pushing 2.2″ tires in the rear. Judging by what we can <em>almost</em> see, Specialized may be (should be) increasing that number — but until it’s confirmed, we can’t be certain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-full-.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1179\" height=\"2091\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-full-.webp\" alt=\"Unbound 2025 Spec Diverge full\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-full-.webp 1179w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-full--169x300.webp 169w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-full--68x120.webp 68w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-full--768x1362.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-full--866x1536.webp 866w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Unbound-2025-Spec-Diverge-full--1155x2048.webp 1155w\" /></a><figcaption>Just casually taking photos by the road on some highly anticipated unreleased bikes, at one of the largest gravel races in the world…</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fork Mount Overload</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bikepackers, rejoice. The new fork is loaded with mounts — three bolts per leg, at least. That makes the front end ready for cages, cargo, or extra bottles without reaching for an aftermarket fork. It also points toward Specialized keeping the Diverge in its original “do-it-all” lane — not just racing but also long-haul, mixed-surface riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2023-specilized-diverge-str-gravel-bike-review-tyler-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2023-specilized-diverge-str-gravel-bike-review-tyler-jpg.webp\" alt=\"specialized diverge str s works gravel bike review\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2023-specilized-diverge-str-gravel-bike-review-tyler-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2023-specilized-diverge-str-gravel-bike-review-tyler-jpg-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2023-specilized-diverge-str-gravel-bike-review-tyler-jpg-800x600.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2023-specilized-diverge-str-gravel-bike-review-tyler-jpg-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2023-specilized-diverge-str-gravel-bike-review-tyler-jpg-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2023-specilized-diverge-str-gravel-bike-review-tyler-jpg-1536x1152.webp 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>The latest addition to the Specialized Diverge lineup was the Diverge STR in 2023.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Due For a Refresh </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been five years since we saw a full Diverge (not including the STR) refresh, and this prototype (more like production-ready) — if it <em>is</em> the next-gen Diverge — seems to hit all the right boxes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is still versatile, with ample tire clearance for 50-55mm (tire size en vogue), <span><em>and</em></span> has gear mounts for a life beyond racing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Still fast, with aero touches and oversized tubes for max power. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>It is still practical, with external routing and likely dropper support.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Specialized-RockCombo-vintage-gravel-bike-Diverge-paint-scheme-Unbound-35.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"764\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Specialized-RockCombo-vintage-gravel-bike-Diverge-paint-scheme-Unbound-35.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Specialized-RockCombo-vintage-gravel-bike-Diverge-paint-scheme-Unbound-35.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Specialized-RockCombo-vintage-gravel-bike-Diverge-paint-scheme-Unbound-35-297x189.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Specialized-RockCombo-vintage-gravel-bike-Diverge-paint-scheme-Unbound-35-800x509.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Specialized-RockCombo-vintage-gravel-bike-Diverge-paint-scheme-Unbound-35-120x76.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Specialized-RockCombo-vintage-gravel-bike-Diverge-paint-scheme-Unbound-35-768x489.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>The current Specialized Diverge frame, in a crazy cool custom paint. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Will it be lighter?
