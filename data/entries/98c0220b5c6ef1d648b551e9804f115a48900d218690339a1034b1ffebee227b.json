But by analyzing observations made by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope over a 20-year period, a research team from the University of Arizona and other institutions has <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/20-year-hubble-study-of-uranus-yields-new-atmospheric-insights/\">provided new insights</a> into the composition and dynamics of the planet’s atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Information about Uranus is limited. What we know is that the planet is composed mainly of water and ammonia ice, its diameter is about 51,000 kilometers, about four times that of the Earth, and its mass is about 15 times greater than Earth’s. Uranus also has <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/uranus/facts/#h-rings\">13 rings and 28 satellites</a>.</p>\n<p>In January 1986, NASA’s Voyager 2 space probe successfully completed what has been, to date, the only exploration of the planet, conducting a flyby as part of its mission to study the outer planets of the solar system.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/we-now-have-a-good-idea-about-the-makeup-of-uranus-atmosphere/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/we-now-have-a-good-idea-about-the-makeup-of-uranus-atmosphere/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Shigeyuki Hando, Wired Japan","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"98c0220b5c6ef1d648b551e9804f115a48900d218690339a1034b1ffebee227b","category":"Tech"}
