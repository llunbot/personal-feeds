Unlike air springs, it doesn’t overheat, plus, says BMC, it doesn’t mar the bike’s aesthetics.</span></p>\n<p><span>The system includes a lock-out and can be fine-tuned via three different stiffnesses of spring and preload spacers. The steerer also allows you to adjust the stack height by 4mm, so you can tweak your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-position/\">ride position</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>For dawn to dusk rides and beyond, there’s scope for internal <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-dynamos/\">dynamo</a> cable routing through the right fork leg.</span></p>\n<h2><span>All the gravel features</span></h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The elastomer inserts in the seatstays allow a further 10mm of compliance at the rear of the frame.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p><span>Like the original URS, the URS LT has a slack 70-degree head tube and long reach, paired with a short stem – a geometry inspired by BMC’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">XC mountain bikes</a> and common to many newer gravel bike frames. </span></p>\n<p><span>BMC says this layout gives the bike stability at high speeds along with sharp steering when required.</span></p>\n<p><span>There’s scope to fit <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">gravel tyres</a> up to 45mm wide, the usual array of mounting points for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bikepacking-bags/\">bikepacking bags</a> and the option to fit <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguards</a> front and rear (including BMC Dfender rear mudguard), as well as a rear rack.</span></p>\n<h2><span>BMC URS LT specs, prices and availability</span></h2>\n<p>The two spec options both include SRAM eTap AXS 12-speed 1x groupsets in a mullet configuration (pairing a road crankset with a mountain bike <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleur</a> and cassette, for a wide range of gearing).</p>\n<p>The higher-spec BMC URS LT One gets a Force/X01 Eagle drivetrain, while the Two gets a Rival/GX Eagle build.</p>\n<p>Both feature a 38-tooth chainring paired with a 10-52t cassette. The One gets carbon wheels rather than alloy, but both have 40mm WTB Raddler tyres (the URS can take tyres up to 700c x 45mm).</p>\n<p><span>What the URS LT doesn’t have, unlike some top-spec gravel bikes, is a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper post</a> as standard. Its D-shaped seatpost means the usual round models won’t fit, although the frame has internal cable routing for a dropper, so watch this space.</span></p>\n<p><span>BMC has given prices in Euros only at launch. Other currencies to follow.</span></p>\n<h3><span>BMC URS LT One</span></h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div>\n<ul><li><span><strong>Frame:</strong> URS Premium Carbon with Micro Travel Technology</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Fork:</strong> Premium Carbon with 20 mm Travel</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Groupset:</strong> SRAM Force/X01 Eagle eTap AXS 12-speed</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Gearing:</strong> 38t chainring, 10-52t cassette</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM Force eTap AXS HRD</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Wheels:</strong> BMC CRD-400 carbon, tubeless-ready</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Tyres:</strong> WTB Raddler 40mm</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Bar:</strong> Easton EA70 AX alloy</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Stem:</strong> BMC MSM02</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Saddle:</strong> WTB SL8 Medium titanium rail</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Seatpost:</strong> URS 01 Premium Carbon zero offset</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Sizes:</strong> S, M, L, XL</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Availability:</strong> Available now</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Price:</strong> €7,999</span></li>\n</ul><h3><span>BMC URS LT Two</span></h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div>\n<ul><li><span><strong>Frame:</strong> URS Premium Carbon with Micro Travel Technology</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Fork:</strong> Premium Carbon with 20 mm Travel</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Groupset:</strong> SRAM Rival/GX Eagle eTap AXS 12-speed</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Gearing:</strong> 38t, 10-52t</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM Rival eTap AXS HRD</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Wheels:</strong> DT Swiss G1800 Spline alloy, tubeless-ready</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Tyres:</strong> WTB Raddler 40mm</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Bar:</strong> Easton EA70 AX alloy</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Stem:</strong> BMC MSM02</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Saddle:</strong> WTB SL8 Medium chromoly rail</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Seatpost:</strong> URS 01 Premium Carbon zero offset</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Sizes:</strong> S, M, L, XL</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Availability:</strong> Available now</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Price:</strong> €5,999</span></li>\n</ul>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"11438f2126ac05791a0918f8a3e6ed14dd7ddd15d330bd1440674333b762b81e","category":"Cycling"}
