Understanding the variations between these modes of flight may help scientists design better and more efficient <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/these-solar-powered-origami-inspired-robots-can-change-shape-mid-flight/\">flying robots</a> in the future. However, decoding insect flight is not as easy as it sounds.</p>\n<p>Winged insects have been around for nearly <a href=\"https://research.gatech.edu/feature/ultrafast-flight\">400 million years</a>, and the evolution of flight in different insect species influences things like how insects flap their wings, what makes some insects highly maneuverable, and how their flight muscles work. A new study has used a mix of evolutionary analysis and robotic model wings to better understand how different flight modes operate.</p>\n<h2>Insects are the most skilled flyers</h2>\n<p>There are organisms other than insects <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/06/why-do-bats-have-such-bizarrely-long-lifespans/\">that can fly</a>. Scientists can also take inspiration from them, so what makes insect flight so special?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976177#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976177&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"09510fd9bad51afe5d7f566f3160269bd93c046bb79fa920c387c853e4e24c8d","category":"Tech"}
