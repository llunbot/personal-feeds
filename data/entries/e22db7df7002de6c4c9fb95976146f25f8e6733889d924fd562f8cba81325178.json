On its <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://blog.chromium.org/&amp;xcust=1-1-1785530-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Chromium Blog</a> Thursday, Google highlighted a series of backend improvements it has made to its Chrome browser to make it faster on the Mac. The improvements go back about three months and have resulted in a 10 percent boost in the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.1&amp;xcust=1-1-1785530-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Speedometer</a> browser benchmark, according to Google.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blog post highlights the following optimizations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Improved HTML Parsing &amp; optimizing specific features: Google “targeted” JavaScript <code>'Object.prototype.toString'</code> and <code>'Array.prototype.join'</code> functions and made improvements in CSS’s InterpolableColor.</li><li>HTML modifications: Google added specialized fast paths for parsing <code>'innerHTM'</code>to update the Document Object Model via JavaScript.</li><li>More efficient pointer compression: Pointer compression is done frequently, so Google made optimizations to this function, which resulted in better performance.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of note, Google reports the new fast path for innerHTML parser will also be used by Apple’s WebKit engine to “create a better web experience for all web users.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The optimizations were made over a period of time, and Google does not state a version number for Chrome as to when the optimizations started to be implemented. The current version of Chrome for Mac is 112.0.5615.49.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our own testing with Speedometer 2.1, the latest version of Chrome posted a score of 405, which is 5.5 percent faster than the latest version of Safari (16.5), which posted a score of 384. Speedometer 2.1 is a benchmark that gauges a browser’s responsiveness with timed simulated user interactions.
