{"title":"EU Adopts New ‘Interoperability’ Requirements for Apple Under DMA","link":"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_816","date":1742425612000,"content":"\n<p>The European Commission, today:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Today, the European Commission adopted two decisions under the\nDigital Markets Act (DMA) specifying the measures that Apple has\nto take to comply with certain aspects of its interoperability\nobligation. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The first set of measures concerns nine iOS connectivity features,\npredominantly used for connected devices such as smartwatches,\nheadphones or TVs. The measures will grant device manufacturers\nand app developers improved access to iPhone features that\ninteract with such devices (e.g. displaying notifications on\nsmartwatches), faster data transfers (e.g. peer-to-peer Wi-Fi\nconnections, and near-field communication) and easier device\nset-up (e.g. pairing).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/19/apple-says-eu-interoperability-requirements-enables-unfettered-access-to-the-iphone-risks-customer-security-and-privacy/\">Benjamin Mayo, reporting for 9to5Mac</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a statement to 9to5Mac, Apple firmly rebuked the EU decision\nannounced today about specific interoperability requirements the\ncompany must implement over the coming months.</p>\n\n<p>Apple said “Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down\nApple’s ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us\nto give away our new features for free to companies who don’t\nhave to play by the same rules. It’s bad for our products and\nfor our European users. We will continue to work with the\nEuropean Commission to help them understand our concerns on\nbehalf of our users”.</p>\n\n<p>In regards to customer privacy, Apple is especially concerned with\nthe requirements surrounding opening up access to the iOS\nnotification system. The company indicated these measures would\nallow companies to suck up all user notifications in an\nunencrypted form to their servers, sidestepping all privacy\nprotections Apple typically enforces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My interpretation of the adopted decision is that the EU is requiring Apple to treat iOS like a PC operating system, like MacOS or Windows, where users can install third-party software that runs, unfettered, in the background.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s statement makes clear their staunch opposition to these decisions. But at least at a superficial level, the European Commission’s tenor has changed. The quotes from the Commission executives (Teresa Ribera, who replaced firebrand Margrethe Vestager as competition chief, and Henna Virkkunen) are anodyne. Nothing of the vituperativeness of the quotes from Vestager and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/16/breton-resigns\">Thierry Breton</a> in years past. But the decisions themselves make clear that the EU isn’t backing down from its general position of seeing itself as the rightful decision-maker for how iOS should function and be engineered, and that Apple’s core competitive asset — making devices that work better together than those from other companies — isn’t legal under the DMA.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/eu-apple-interop-requirements\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a10cecb932ff7b87f62716c72e161ebe39134059e8e0bbcbb9f68a2edf05b489","category":"Tech"}
