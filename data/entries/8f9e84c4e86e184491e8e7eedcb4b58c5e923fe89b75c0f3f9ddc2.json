Dominion Voting Systems, opening its reply brief in support of its motion for a summary judgment against Fox “News” (PDF):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Finally. Fox has conceded what it knew all along. The charges Fox\nbroadcast against Dominion are false. Fox does not spend a word of\nits brief arguing the truth of any accused statement. Fox has\nproduced no evidence — none, zero — supporting those lies. This\nconcession should come as no surprise. Discovery into Fox has\nproven that from the top of the organization to the bottom, Fox\nalways knew the absurdity of the Dominion “stolen election” story.\nNow, having failed to put in any evidence to the contrary (because\nno such evidence exists), Fox has conceded the falsity of the\nDominion allegations it broadcast.</p>\n\n<p>That concession is no small thing. Thirty percent or more of\nAmericans still believe the lie that the 2020 election was\nstolen. The heart of that lie remains the false conspiracy theory\nthat Fox legitimized and mainstreamed starting on November 8 — that Dominion stole the election, using secret algorithms in its\nsoftware originally designed for a Venezuelan dictator. Because\nof these lies, Dominion now may be “one of the most demonized\nbrands in the United States or the world.” Dominion employees\n<em>still</em> endure threats and harassment. So it matters that Fox in\nprivate ridiculed — and never believed — the lie. And it\nmatters that Fox has now in this litigation conceded these\nallegations were false.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Fox seeks a First Amendment license to knowingly spread lies. Fox\nwould have this Court create an absolute legal immunity for\nknowingly spreading false allegations — lies — for profit,\nregardless of how absurd the lies are, regardless how many people\nin the chain of command know the lies are false, and regardless\nhow many people are hurt — so long as the false claims are\n“newsworthy.” Fox proffers a completely made-up “rule,” contrary\nto decades of jurisprudence since <em>New York Times v. Sullivan</em>. As\nJudge Nichols ruled in rejecting MyPillow’s analogous argument\nthat the First Amendment provides “blanket protection” from\ndefamation for statements about a “‘public debate in a public\nforum,’” “there is no such immunity. Instead, the First Amendment\nsafeguards our ‘profound national commitment to the principle that\ndebate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and\nwide-open,’ by limiting viable defamation claims to provably false\nstatements made with actual malice.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/09/finally-indeed-dominion-fox\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"5dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8f9e84c4e86e184491e8e7eedcb4b58c5e923fe89b75c0f3f9ddc2","category":"Tech"}
