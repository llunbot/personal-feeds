And that includes not just owners of older AMD GPUs but people who use Nvidia GeForce or Intel Arc cards, too.</p>\n\n<p>First, AMD is finally ready to reveal more details about FidelityFX Super Resolution version 3, the latest major update to the company's open source upsampling technology. A competitor to Nvidia's proprietary Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and Intel's GPU-agnostic but nascent XeSS, all of these technologies attempt to generate a high-resolution image by rendering a lower-resolution image, blowing it up and filling in the gaps algorithmically to approximate what a natively rendered image would have looked like.</p>\n<h2>What GPUs support FSR 3?</h2>\n<p>Last year, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/amds-fsr-2-0-debut-while-limited-has-upscaled-our-gpu-hopes/\">FSR 2.0</a> went a long way toward making the technology more competitive with DLSS while also working on a wider range of graphics hardware from AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. Contrary to some prior speculation, FSR 3 will continue to support a wide range of old and new GPUs from all three major GPU companies. AMD has confirmed to us that the following graphics hardware should all support FSR 3:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962937#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962937&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb5b300ffbaaecfb27f7b09694196c15ac6fe39cdb2e984141470c03da79c6b6","category":"Tech"}
