Located in the MTB mecca of Squamish, B.C. the company has incredible testing grounds for MTB gear, but plenty of scenic roadways and routes for road and gravel riding as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Spring 2024, 7mesh has announced a few new or updated pieces for each riding discipline. The redesigned Glidepath pant is a lightweight, general-purpose riding pant for MTB. Their new Horizon Base Layer offers insulation for cooler MTB or gravel rides, and the new Pace and Atlas road jerseys provide options for something race-worthy or recreational.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MTB:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-on-rider.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-on-rider.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Glidepath pants, on rider\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-on-rider.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-on-rider-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-on-rider-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-on-rider-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-on-rider-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-on-rider-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the MTB side of things, 7mesh has fully updated their <strong>Glidepath pant</strong>. The Glidepaths are designed as a versatile, pedal-friendly pant suitable for a wide range of conditions. For 2024 they’ve been updated with a new trim shape that provides more knee articulation. The new models also get a waist adjuster that features a continuous belt and small locking closures that hold tight with minimal bulk. If that system doesn’t work for you, the pants have belt loops as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Glidepath pants are constructed from a lightweight, 4-way stretch fabric with a PFC/PFAS-free DWR coating. Other features include a double-snap zippered fly, and updated cuffed hems with elastic stretch panels. The Glidepaths offer a slightly relaxed regular fit, and are cut with room for light-duty knee pads. The waist is raised at the back to ensure good coverage in riding position.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-back-lrg.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1023\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-back-lrg.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Glidepath pants, back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-back-lrg.jpg 1023w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-back-lrg-256x300.jpg 256w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-back-lrg-800x938.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-back-lrg-102x120.jpg 102w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Glidepath-pant-back-lrg-768x901.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For storage the pants offer two hand pockets, plus two zippered side pockets. Environmental advocates will be happy to know the Glidepaths are made from Bluesign-approved and Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified fabrics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7mesh offers the Glidepath pant in men’s and women’s models. MSRP is $180, and sizes range from XS-XXL. Men’s color options are Black, Midnight Blue or Shale. Women’s color choices are Black or Shale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve got a pair of the Glidepath pants in testing now, so watch for my review later this summer!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MTB/Gravel:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-mens.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1635\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-mens.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Horizon base layer, mens\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-mens.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-mens-220x300.jpg 220w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-mens-800x1090.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-mens-88x120.jpg 88w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-mens-768x1046.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-mens-1127x1536.jpg 1127w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo by J.

This thin, breathable base layer is made from anti-bacterial, sweat-wicking polyester that offers UPF +50 sun protection. This piece was included in both 7mesh’s MTB and Road/Gravel press releases, so it’s suitable for any of those types of riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Horizon Base Layer offers an athletic fit that hugs the body without fitting tightly. It is designed to pair well with 7mesh’s jerseys and thermals. This garment is made from eco-friendly PFC/PFAS-free fabrics, which are both Bluesign and Oeko-Tex 100 certified.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-womens.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1538\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-womens.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Horizon base layer, womens\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-womens.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-womens-234x300.jpg 234w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-womens-800x1025.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-womens-94x120.jpg 94w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-womens-768x984.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Horizon-base-layer-womens-1198x1536.jpg 1198w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo by J.

This jersey is ideal on its own for warmer rides or as a layer, either under a vest or over an insulating base layer. The Atlas is offered in women’s and men’s styles, and in both long and short-sleeved models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlas offers a skin fit that sits somewhere between ‘race’ and ‘relaxed’. It is made from a tight-knit LYCRA T400 fabric that provides elastane-free stretch, a lasting shape and moisture-wicking properties. To enhance free movement the Atlas jersey’s front hem does not have a gripper. The rear hem does, however, to keep things in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Atlas-jersey-back.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Atlas-jersey-back.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Atlas jersey, back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Atlas-jersey-back.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Atlas-jersey-back-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Atlas-jersey-back-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Atlas-jersey-back-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Atlas-jersey-back-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7mesh-Atlas-jersey-back-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo by J.
