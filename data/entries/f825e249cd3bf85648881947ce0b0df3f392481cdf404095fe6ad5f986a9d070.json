With a cool demeanour and effortless riding style, the Swiss cemented himself as the patron of the peloton, the guy everyone looked up to, listened to and wanted to impress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today Cancellara owns ProTour team Tudor Pro Cycling, which this year <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tudor-pro-cycling-giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">raced its first Grand Tour</a> as a wildcard at the Giro d’Italia, finishing a highly respectable tenth with Aussie rider Michael Storer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among a sprawling conversation, Cancellara discusses why he never talks tactics with his own team; the importance of rider safety, especially in light of the death of would-have-been Tudor Pro rider, Gino Mäder; his rivalry with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/i-suffered-less-at-roubaix-than-flanders-tom-boonen-in-retirement\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Boonen</a>; if and when Tudor Pro Cycling will race the Tour; the importance of failure – and where he hurt most; and the effect of social media on young riders and cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview begins at 9min 27sec.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/cyclist-magazine-podcast/episodes/117-fabian-cancellara\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 117 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Did you know Cyclist is also stunning monthly print magazine?
