{"title":"All-Hands Siri Team Meeting Leaks to Bloomberg","link":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/apple-s-siri-chief-calls-ai-delays-ugly-and-embarrassing-promises-fixes","date":1741987436000,"content":"\n<p>Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg today:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Inc.’s top executive overseeing its Siri virtual assistant\ntold staff that delays to key features have been ugly and\nembarrassing, and a decision to publicly promote the technology\nbefore it was ready made matters worse.</p>\n\n<p>Robby Walker, who serves as a senior director at Apple, delivered\nthe stark comments during an all-hands meeting for the Siri\ndivision, saying that the team was facing a bad period. Walker\nalso said that it’s unclear when the enhancements will actually\nlaunch, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who\nasked not to be identified because the gathering was private.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Robby Walker is not Apple’s “top executive overseeing its Siri virtual assistant”. Take your pick of whether that’s SVP John Giannandrea or CEO Tim Cook, but Walker reports to Giannandrea. Gurman, of course, knows this better than I do; I suspect he knows Apple’s entire org chart. But it makes Bloomberg’s headline — “Apple’s Siri Chief Calls AI Delays Ugly and Embarrassing, Promises Fixes” — misleading. Also somewhat misleading in that headline is that these comments from Walker were clearly <em>not</em> meant to leak. This is not a public apology, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/28/tim-cook-apologizes-for-apple-maps-points-to-competitive-alternatives/\">like the one Tim Cook wrote and signed in 2012</a> in the aftermath of the Apple Maps launch with iOS 6.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Still, he praised the team for developing “incredibly impressive”\nfeatures and vowed to deliver an industry-leading virtual\nassistant to consumers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those two words are the only direct quote in the first nine paragraphs of Bloomberg’s report, which is kind of crazy, because the second half of Gurman’s story is full of quotes. I suspect his editors did Gurman a disservice on this one. The quotes are juicy AF, but don’t really start until the 10th paragraph. Like, for example, <em>which</em> Siri features does Walker think are “incredibly impressive”? No snark, I’d love to know. Is it <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber\">Siri’s sports knowledge</a>? The new product knowledge feature, that gives <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@gruber/114127816716893319\">incomplete and/or incorrect instructions</a> for how to toggle preferences in Settings? OK I guess that’s some snark, but I sincerely and honestly would love to know which Siri features the senior director in charge of Siri considers “incredibly impressive”.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Walker told staff in the meeting that the delays were especially\n“ugly” because Apple had already showed off the features publicly.\n“This was not one of these situations where we get to show people\nour plan after it’s done,” he said. “We showed people before.”</p>\n\n<p>“To make matters worse,” Walker said, Apple’s marketing\ncommunications department wanted to promote the enhancements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, this meeting clearly was <em>not</em> intended to leak. (It’s perhaps another knock against the Siri team, in addition to the quality of their output, that they leak internal meetings.) But that comes across as Walker blaming marketing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Walker also raised doubts about even meeting the current release\nexpectations. Though Apple is aiming for iOS 19, it “doesn’t mean\nthat we’re shipping then,” Walker said. The company has several\nmore priorities in development, and trade-offs will need to be\nmade, he said.</p>\n\n<p>“We have other commitments across Apple to other projects,” Walker\nsaid, citing new software and hardware initiatives. “We want to\nkeep our commitments to those, and we understand those are now\npotentially more timeline-urgent than the features that have been\ndeferred.” He said decisions on timing will be made on a\n“case-by-case basis” as work progresses on products planned for\nnext year.</p>\n\n<p>“Customers are not expecting only these new features but they also\nwant a more fully rounded-out Siri,” he said. “We’re going to ship\nthese features and more as soon as they are ready.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The customers still haven’t gotten their appetizers, but it’s time to start the entrees, so the kitchen staff is working on those now. But don’t worry, they hope to get the appetizers out alongside dessert. But it’s OK because dessert might be late too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As of Friday, Apple doesn’t plan to immediately fire any top\nexecutives over the AI crisis, according to people with knowledge\nof the matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’d be very curious to know just how many people could possibly be familiar with this particular matter. Because this particular matter comes down to what Tim Cook is thinking. I’m thinking it’s about six people he might discuss this with. Wait, no, I just thought of a seventh. I’m going to say seven, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/leadership/\">tops</a>. But maybe I’m wrong, and Tim Cook is the chatty sort, who openly talks with a large number of senior managers about whom he might fire.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Walker said the decision to delay the features was made because of\nquality issues and that the company has found the technology only\nworks properly up to two-thirds to 80% of the time. He said the\ngroup “can make more progress to get those percentages up, so that\nusers get something they can really count on.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s unclear exactly which features these are in reference to, but presumably they’re not the “incredibly impressive” ones. Because something that “only works properly up to two-thirds” of the time only seems regular impressive to me, not incredibly impressive. Maybe it’s the ones that work properly four out of five times that are incredible?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Walker compared the endeavor to an attempt to swim to Hawaii. “We\nswam hundreds of miles — we set a Guinness Book for World Records\nfor swimming distance — but we still didn’t swim to Hawaii,” he\nsaid. “And we were being jumped on, not for the amazing swimming\nthat we did, but the fact that we didn’t get to the destination.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’d say it’s a little more like selling customers tickets for a cruise that includes a stop in Hawaii, then never actually getting to Hawaii, and hoping they didn’t notice when the ship returns to port to disembark.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He showed examples during the meeting of the technology working:\nIt was able to locate his driver’s license number on command and\nfind specific photos of a child. He also demonstrated how the\ntechnology could precisely manipulate apps via voice control. It\nembedded content in an email, added recipients and made other\nchanges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s the biggest actual news in the report, and it’s in paragraph 23.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Walker said that some staffers may feel “relieved” over the\ndelays. “If you were using these features in the build, you were\nprobably wondering: Are these ready? How do I feel about shipping\nthese to our customers? Is this the right choice?”</p>\n\n<p>He added that some employees “might be feeling embarrassed.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, I’ll reiterate that this was a private meeting, not meant to leak. Maybe it’s an inaccurate summary. I hope it is. But as reported by Gurman, this meeting reeks of <em>you-all-deserve-participation-trophies-to-reward-your-hard-work-and-it’s-OK-to-feel-embarrassed</em> vibes. What’s needed, quite obviously, is some “What is it supposed to do? / <a href=\"https://fortune.com/article/inside-apple/\">So why the fuck doesn’t it do that?</a>” vibes.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/14/all-hands-siri-team-meeting-leaks-to-bloomberg\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9b39ffd1ae8e2ca660b2607c0733680a78304c0e65b179a1fc896709128d90b1","category":"Tech"}
