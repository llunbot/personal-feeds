{"title":"Intel Arc B570 review: At $219, the cheapest good graphics card","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/intel-arc-b570-review-at-219-the-cheapest-good-graphics-card/","date":1737036039000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/review-intel-arc-b580-is-a-compelling-if-incredibly-tardy-250-midrange-gpu/\">Intel's Arc B580 graphics cards</a> have been its best-reviewed to date, maintaining the aggressive pricing of the old A-series Arc cards with fewer driver bugs, fewer weird performance outliers, and fewer caveats all around.</p>\n<p>And this appears to be translating to retail success—the B580 is sold out across the board and difficult to find at its $249 MSRP. It's hard to tell if this is because demand has been good or supply was low (Intel says it has been restocking \"weekly,\" for what that's worth). But regardless, there's clearly been some pent-up demand for an inexpensive-but-competent entry-level graphics card with decent ray-tracing performance and power efficiency and more than 8GB of RAM.</p>\n<p>The Arc B570 is a less-powerful, less-interesting card than the B580, with fewer of Intel's Xe-cores, less memory bandwidth, and 10GB of RAM instead of 12GB. But it offers performance very similar to the RTX 4060 for $80 less—at least, if Intel and its partners can keep it in stock at that price—which makes it a dramatically more interesting budget option than $200-ish cards like the GeForce RTX 3050 or Radeon RX 6600.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/intel-arc-b570-review-at-219-the-cheapest-good-graphics-card/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/intel-arc-b570-review-at-219-the-cheapest-good-graphics-card/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6a509f20b90ba6221f139fa38da71b2a8a2d1995c5a76e1d89587427924f5dac","category":"Tech"}
