{"title":"Google to Change How It Handles Location History Data, Seemingly Ending Controversial ‘Geofence Warrants’","link":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/12/end-geofence-warrants","date":1702941720000,"content":"\n<p>Jennifer Lynch, writing for the EFF:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/maps/updates-to-location-history-and-new-controls-coming-soon-to-maps/\">announced</a> this week that it will be making several \nimportant changes to the way it handles users’ “Location History” \ndata. These changes would appear to make it much more difficult — if not impossible — for Google to provide mass location data in \nresponse to a <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/googles-sensorvault-can-tell-police-where-youve-been\">geofence warrant</a>, a change we’ve been \n<a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/its-time-google-resist-geofence-warrants-and-stand-its-affected-users\">asking</a> Google to implement for years. </p>\n\n<p>Geofence warrants require a provider — almost always Google — to \nsearch its entire reserve of user location data to identify <em>all</em> \nusers or devices located within a geographic area during a time \nperiod specified by law enforcement. These warrants <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/10/california-court-suppresses-evidence-overbroad-geofence-warrant\">violate the \nFourth Amendment</a> because they are not targeted to a \nparticular individual or device, like a typical warrant for \ndigital communications. The only “evidence” supporting a geofence \nwarrant is that a crime occurred in a particular area, and the \nperpetrator likely carried a cell phone that shared location data \nwith Google. For this reason, they inevitably sweep up potentially \nhundreds of people who have no connection to the crime under \ninvestigation — and could turn each of those people into a \n<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/google-tracked-his-bike-ride-past-burglarized-home-made-him-n1151761\">suspect</a>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.google/products/maps/updates-to-location-history-and-new-controls-coming-soon-to-maps/\">Google’s announcement, from Marlo McGriff, director of product for Google Maps</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Timeline feature in Maps helps you remember places you’ve been \nand is powered by a setting called Location History. If you’re \namong the subset of users who have chosen to turn Location History \non (it’s off by default), soon your Timeline will be saved right \non your device — giving you even more control over your data. \nJust like before, you can delete all or part of your information \nat any time or disable the setting entirely. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re getting a new phone or are worried about losing your \nexisting one, you can always choose to back up your data to the \ncloud so it doesn’t get lost. We’ll automatically encrypt your \nbacked-up data so no one can read it, including Google. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason these overly broad geofence warrants “almost always” were specific to Google is that Apple never collected location data that could be collected in the aggregate like this. From <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/pdf/requests-2022-H1-en.pdf\">Apple’s most recent government transparency report</a> (PDF), covering the first half of 2022:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple may also receive requests from government agencies seeking \ncustomer data related to specific latitude and longitudes \ncoordinates (geofence) for a specified time period. Apple does not \nhave any data to provide in response to geofence requests. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I checked with a source at Apple, and they believe they have never collected or stored geolocation data in a manner that can be linked to groups of individuals in a certain area or areas.</p>\n\n<p>Good on Google, though, for changing this.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/18/google-geofence-warrants\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"85625da8f63bfcad347335102e09577579c8cad28924553da433d9b52894bf10","category":"Tech"}
