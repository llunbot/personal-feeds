It's got a great design at any price point.                      [credit:\n                        Ron Amadeo                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>I think at this point we can call the Pixel A series a \"mid-range powerhouse.\" Google has again turned in one of the best mid-range phones out there, thanks to its no-nonsense software with day-one OS updates, a long-lasting battery, and good-enough modern internals. In a world full of wild gimmicks and smartphones with a thousand extras, Google is going with just the basics for $449. It's not really what you would call \"new\" or \"exciting,\" but for basic usage, the Pixel 5a has everything you need in a smartphone and nothing you don't.</p>\n<p>On the surface, <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_5a_5g?hl=en-US\" target=\"_blank\">the Pixel 5a</a> looks very similar to the previous release in this line. You get a sufficient, modern design with a slim bezel and a hole punch camera on the front, plus a gloriously flat, undistorted screen. There's a wraparound plastic back that looks kind of plain, just like the Pixel 4a (it's fine, but we still prefer the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/google-pixel-3a-hands-on-the-best-parts-of-the-pixel-for-half-the-price/\">two-tone stylings</a> of the Pixel 3a back). Being mid-range means you get some throwback features you might still like, like a rear capacitive fingerprint reader (as opposed to the in-screen fingerprint readers you'd get on a flagship phone) and a headphone jack.</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><th>SPECS AT A GLANCE</th>\n</tr><tr><th></th>\n<th>Pixel 5a</th>\n</tr><tr><th>SCREEN</th>\n<td>2400×1080 6.34 inches (413 ppi)\n<p>OLED, 20:9 aspect ratio</p></td>\n</tr><tr><th>OS</th>\n<td>Android 11</td>\n</tr><tr><th>CPU</th>\n<td>Eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G\n<p>Two Cortex A76 cores and six Cortex A55 cores, up to 2.4 GHz, 7 nm</p></td>\n</tr><tr><th>RAM</th>\n<td>6GB</td>\n</tr><tr><th>GPU</th>\n<td>Adreno 620</td>\n</tr><tr><th>STORAGE</th>\n<td>128GB</td>\n</tr><tr><th>NETWORKING</th>\n<td>802.11b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, NFC, eSIM</td>\n</tr><tr><th>PORTS</th>\n<td>USB Type-C, 3.5 mm headphone jack</td>\n</tr><tr><th>CAMERA</th>\n<td>Rear: 12.2 MP main camera\n<p>Front: 8 MP camera</p></td>\n</tr><tr><th>SIZE</th>\n<td>156.2×73.2×8.8 mm</td>\n</tr><tr><th>WEIGHT</th>\n<td>183 g</td>\n</tr><tr><th>BATTERY</th>\n<td>4680 mAh</td>\n</tr><tr><th>STARTING PRICE</th>\n<td>$449</td>\n</tr><tr><th>OTHER PERKS</th>\n<td>rear fingerprint reader, IP67 water resistance</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><p>There are some big additions this year, though. The first, which isn't noticeable from the pictures, is that the Pixel 5a is a lot bigger than the 4a. You'll see this not only in the screen size (6.34-inches versus 5.81-inches) but also in the body, with the Pixel 5a measuring 154.9 mm × 73.7 mm compared to the 144 mm × 69.4 mm of the 4a. The bigger body comes with the same primary benefit as all big phones—a bigger battery. The Pixel 5a is getting a huge upgrade to a 4680 mAh battery, and that comes with a giant runtime advantage over its predecessor. I never had an issue lasting an entire day with the Pixel 4a battery, in fact you could easily go for two light-usage days.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789307#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789307&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0e933ce30b6851fe615bbec16e4709a8059032c54ed20186564c25d7e9106140","category":"Tech"}
