Now, Nintendo is planning a process to allow players to share their digital Switch purchases in a similar way.</p>\n<p>The new \"virtual game card\" system—which Nintendo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWwyh74MXXY\">announced today</a> ahead of a planned late April rollout—will allow players to \"load\" and \"eject\" digital games via a dedicated management screen. An ejected digital game can't be played on the original console, but it can be digitally loaded onto a new console and played there without restriction by any user logged into that system.</p>\n<div><div></div></div>\n<p>While an Internet connection is required when loading and ejecting digital games in this way, the Internet will not be required to play the shared digital game after that initial process is complete. And while both Switch consoles will need to be synced up via a \"local connection\" the first time such sharing is done, subsequent shares won't require the consoles to be in physical proximity.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3cbcaf188dfac6c831d1a4affd5de1cd215321a71d7be5044ea6b56e4081a0b3","category":"Tech"}
