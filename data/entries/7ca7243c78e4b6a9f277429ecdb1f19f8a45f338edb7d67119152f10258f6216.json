Specialized says these features are important for optimal comfort and injury prevention.</p>\n<p>The upper is changed in shape but not in material, being made from the same lightweight welded mesh and Dyneema upper that the brand says is supportive and protective yet comfortable and breathable.</p>\n<p>Of course it's designed to brush off the challenges that off-road riding has to offer, with an external toe cap, a SlipNot rubber heel and toe tread, and the option to add replaceable toe spikes for adaptability over varying terrain.</p>\n<p>The main story, though, is in the classic lace closure. Specialized explains, 'Lacing closures give riders multiple points of cincture to effect precise adjustment for a sublime feel right out of the box. </p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9874/specialized-s-works-recon-lace-images#2\"><p><span>Image 3 of</span> 28</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/recon_lace_webres-3606.jpg?itok=tG2gQv0G\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 3 of </span>28</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>'We also removed any extraneous hardware from the upper to make the shoe supple and essentially create a hug for your feet.'</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8632/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Tour de France 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9048/kingmaker-allan-peiper-profile\">Kingmaker: Allan Peiper profile</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 116: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><h3>Show your colour</h3>\n<p>Another welcome addition for the S-Works Recon Lace is the colour choice, with four options: Black, which is mostly grey; Oak Green, which is similar to the colour in classic camouflage; Aloha, which is a loud pattern of blue, yellow, turquoise and black; and White which is, well, white.</p>\n<p>It's slightly heavier than the Boa-equipped Recon, with a size 42 coming in at a claimed 280g, but it's also cheaper – emphasis on the 'er' – at £300.</p>\n<p>For more information and to grab a pair, visit <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/gb/en/s-works-recon-lace-gravel-shoes/p/205506?color=330103-205506&amp;searchText=61521-8136\" target=\"_blank\">specialized.com</a>. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9874/specialized-s-works-recon-lace-images\">Specialized S-Works Recon Lace images</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>12 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9874%2Fspecialized-s-works-recon-lace-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Specialized%20S-Works%20Recon%20Lace%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9874%2Fspecialized-s-works-recon-lace-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Specialized%20S-Works%20Recon%20Lace%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9874%2Fspecialized-s-works-recon-lace-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Specialized%20S-Works%20Recon%20Lace%20images&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9874%2Fspecialized-s-works-recon-lace-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9874/specialized-s-works-recon-lace-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 28</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/recon_lace_webres-4528.jpg?itok=iAna2jor\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/shoes\">Shoes</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"7ca7243c78e4b6a9f277429ecdb1f19f8a45f338edb7d67119152f10258f6216","category":"Cycling"}
