Unfortunately, while racing the Benelux Tour in the Netherlands on Thursday Docker hit the ground and broke his elbow.</p><p>“There was a mass pile-up at KM0 and I was one of many guys that fell there,” Docker told CyclingTips. “I had pain in my arm but I wanted to finish the stage, we had an important job to defend the lead and I wanted to give myself the chance to continue with the race. The pain worsened as the stage went on, I was dropped but made it through the stage. I was then hopeful it was tendon damage or something, not race ending. A precautionary Xray told otherwise.”</p><p>The X-ray showed a fracture in Docker’s elbow, and the decision was made to put it in a cast right away. Docker hopes to get back into training as soon as he can, with the major focus being a final start at Paris-Roubaix in October.</p><p>“Pretty annoying but not disastrous,” Docker said.</p><p>Docker’s first Paris-Roubaix appearance was in 2009 with Skil – Shimano. Since then Docker has participated in nine editions, his top result was 15th in 2011. The race has always been a key moment of Docker’s season, so ending his career there is something extra special.</p></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"90093601bcc3633c9fb9dbad0e04122fdfef8d18af0da5a24a6edecbd0b12f3d","category":"Cycling"}
