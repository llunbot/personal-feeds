It lets you send messages to friends, or groups of friends, over Wi-Fi or 4G/5G and make savings on your phone bill. (Of course, you may end up paying for data if you go over your limit, so don’t go crazy!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, right now WhatsApp is only available for iPhone–there isn’t a version of the app for the iPad despite the fact that WhatsApp boss Will Cathcart (in January 2022) acknowledged in an interview that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678415/whatsapp-may-finally-come-to-the-ipad.html\">people had been asking for an iPad app for a long time</a>. Cathcart revealed that much of the infrastructure to develop an iPad app is already in place, but he made no immediate promises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things could be about to change though. WhatsApp for iPad is available as a beta via TestFlight and can be installed on the iPad if you are part of WhatsApp beta testing program. Sadly the Whatsapp for iPad beta has remained a beta since it became available in September 2023 and there’s still no news about when it might be released to the public. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren’t part of the WhatsApp beta, don’t despair. In this tutorial, we show you how to use WhatsApp on the iPad using WhatsApp Web. This service connects to the WhatsApp account on your iPhone (or Android device) and forwards the messages on to your iPad, allowing you to send and receive messages, pictures and videos. It’s not quite native WhatsApp on the iPad, but it’s the next best thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whatsapp-desktop/id1147396723?mt=12\" target=\"_blank\">WhatsApp Desktop</a> version if you want to use WhatsApp on your Mac. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671953/how-to-get-whatsapp-on-a-mac.html\">How to get WhatsApp on Mac</a> for more information about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WhatsApp for iPad release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While right now there is no WhatsApp app on the iPad, it does look like there is one coming soon. As of September 2023, WhatsApp beta testers have been able to try out a WhatsApp for iPad beta. The beta looks like the most promising evidence yet that a version of Whatsapp will come to the iPad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a year later there is still no news about when a Whatsapp version for the iPad will be available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is Whatsapp for iPad still in beta? If the lack of WhatsApp on iPad is due to security issues, perhaps changes in iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 that now allow RCS Messaging support will pave the way for the update. Support for Rich Communication Services (RCS) means that iPhone users can see if their message has been delivered to Android users and see typing indicators that indicate if they are responding. Apple claims the reason why RCS wasn’t previously on the iPhone was down to security issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, it doesn’t seem to be Whatsapp’s desire to keep Whatsapp off the iPad. Over the years there have been many indications that WhatsApp would eventually come to iPad, including Will Cathcart’s revelation above that people have been asking for one, and this tweet in August 2021, indicating that a team at Meta/Facebook-owned WhatsApp was working on a WhatsApp for iPad app:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>• Is WhatsApp for iPad a web app?

Most importantly, unlike when the service is used on a Mac or PC, notifications from web browsers aren’t supported on iOS/iPadOS. You won’t be notified of new messages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from that and a few small bugs, however, the service is pretty easy to use and a great alternative for WhatsApp users keen to access the service on iPad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WhatsApp Web is a free and easy way to access the WhatsApp service on your iPad. Although you won’t get notifications (as you would when using the service on Mac or PC), it’s a great way to easily access your messages on a tablet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234137/how-to-switch-from-android-to-iphone-tips.html\">Moving from Android to iPhone</a> and want to bring your WhatsApp messages with you?
