This made the feature less useful for developers or\nusers hoping to test iCloud features in macOS, or whose apps rely\non some kind of syncing with iCloud, or people who just wanted\neasy access to their iCloud data from within a VM.</p>\n\n<p>This limitation is going away in macOS 15 Sequoia, according to\n<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/using_icloud_with_macos_virtual_machines\">developer documentation</a> that Apple released yesterday. As\nlong as your host operating system is macOS 15 or newer and your\nguest operating system is macOS 15 or newer, VMs will now be able\nto sign into and use iCloud and other Apple ID-related services\njust as they would when running directly on the hardware.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nice change. Makes me wonder if this is related to Apple’s use of virtualization to allow security researchers to inspect the OS images for its Private Cloud Computer servers for Apple Intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2024/06/sequoia-virtual-machines-allow-logging-in-to-icloud/\">Via Dan Moren</a>.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/12/macos-15-vms-icloud\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d90bcc90b42087d6e5d58769d13800a19e8c29d87fd55c04800483a30c7d8c3d","category":"Tech"}
