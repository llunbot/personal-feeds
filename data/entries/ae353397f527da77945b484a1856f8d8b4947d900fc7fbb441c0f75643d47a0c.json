Because of technology limitations, there was no requirement to implement STIR/SHAKEN on older TDM-based networks used with copper landlines, for instance. The FCC has said that \"providers using older forms of network technology [must] either upgrade their networks to IP or actively work to develop a caller ID authentication solution that is operational on non-IP networks.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799376#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799376&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ae353397f527da77945b484a1856f8d8b4947d900fc7fbb441c0f75643d47a0c","category":"Tech"}
