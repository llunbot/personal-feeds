Fifteen Republicans and 50 Democrats voted in opposition, and one Democrat voted present, CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/tiktok-ban-bill-house-vote-03-13-24/index.html\">reported</a>.</p>\n<p>TikTok is not happy. A spokesperson told Ars, \"This process was secret and the bill was jammed through for one reason: it's a ban. We are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents, and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service.\"</p>\n<p>Lawmakers insist that the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521\">Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act</a> is not a ban. Instead, they claim the law gives TikTok a choice: either divest from ByteDance's China-based owners or face the consequences of TikTok being cut off in the US.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009848#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009848&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"367ea47713b4e0db6311992856e5e2bcbaddc13025f03bebcec44eac59a8262f","category":"Tech"}
