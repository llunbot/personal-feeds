Apple said its first round of appointments will take place from tomorrow through Sunday, with slots to be filled on a first‑come, first‑served basis.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has yet to provide any further information about how to sign up for a demo, but those details will presumably be shared soon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven that the Vision Pro starts at $3,499, these free demos will be especially important for customers who want to experience spatial computing without spending a fortune. During the demo, they will learn how to navigate the visionOS operating system, and explore built-in apps such as Apple TV, Photos, and Safari.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/vision-pro-apple-store-demos/\">Vision Pro Demo Appointments Begin Tomorrow at All U.S. Apple Stores</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vision-pro-demo-appointments-begin-tomorrow-at-all-u-s-apple-stores.2418088/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c383e62d68f04a161be527e919cf19b790a0a590b7ebb70904b050af729745d3","category":"Apple"}
