{"title":"Introducing HashiCorp Validated Patterns for product use cases","link":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/introducing-hashicorp-validated-patterns-for-product-use-cases","date":1747756800000,"content":"<p>The HashiCorp Technical Field Organization (TFO) partners with enterprise customers to help them navigate complex infrastructure challenges and achieve specific technical outcomes. Over thousands of these engagements, consistent patterns have emerged. We’ve documented many of these battle-tested patterns using HashiCorp products and the broader tooling ecosystem to solve common challenges. We call these HashiCorp Validated Patterns and we’re now making them publicly available.</p>\n\n<p>One of the unique values of Validated Patterns is that they reflect shared knowledge across our global technical field staff. These solutions aren’t the opinion of one person. They’re reviewed, improved, and endorsed by our internal technical community.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve launched a <a href=\"http://developer.hashicorp.com/validated-patterns\">dedicated section of our developer website</a> to house HashiCorp Validated Patterns, making this curated knowledge available to every user. We’re now reviewing and publishing them, so you have access to these patterns whenever you need them.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Validated Patterns matter</h2>\n\n<p>While product documentation explains how to use our tools, many practitioners are looking for guidance on how to achieve a specific outcome. The question isn’t “how do I configure Vault?” it’s “how do I use Vault to secure Kafka credentials in a multi-team environment?”</p>\n\n<p>These patterns bridge the gap between documentation and implementation. Each pattern provides prescriptive steps, architectural considerations, and relevant code examples to help you achieve a defined technical objective. They represent our best thinking, shaped by internal collaboration and refined by real-world success.</p>\n\n<p>By publishing this content broadly, we aim to give every user access to the same trusted solutions that we’ve used to accelerate time-to-value for our enterprise customers.</p>\n\n<h2>Validated Patterns for specific outcomes</h2>\n\n<p>Our focus is typically on three primary categories that align with common challenges we see across enterprise infrastructure teams:</p>\n\n<h3>1. HashiCorp product integrations</h3>\n\n<p>These patterns demonstrate how to combine multiple HashiCorp tools to create streamlined workflows. Examples include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/validated-patterns/packer/push-containers-cloud-registries\">Use HCP Packer and Terraform to manage cloud container registries</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/validated-patterns/terraform/vulnerability-and-patch-management\">Vulnerability and patch management of infrastructure images with HCP</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>2. Third-party product integrations</h3>\n\n<p>These patterns help you integrate HashiCorp tools with other components in your software stack, such as CI/CD pipelines, developer portals, and security tooling:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/validated-patterns/vault/integrate-vault-with-backstage-and-okta\">Integrate Vault with Backstage and Okta</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/validated-patterns/vault/vault-securing-kafka\">Secure Apache Kafka credentials using HCP Vault</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/validated-patterns/terraform/terraform-palo-alto-prisma-cloud-integration\">Integrate Terraform with Prisma Cloud by Palo Alto Networks</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>3. Migration guides</h3>\n\n<p>These patterns guide teams through the process of shifting from legacy infrastructure or similar tools to HashiCorp solutions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/validated-patterns/terraform/migrate-from-cloudformation\">Migrate AWS CloudFormation templates to Terraform configurations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/validated-patterns/vault/vault-migrate-storage-raft\">Migrate Vault backend from DynamoDB to Integrated Storage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/validated-patterns/terraform/migrate-terraform-orgs-projects\">Migrate Terraform Enterprise organizations to projects</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Learn more in our Validated Patterns library</h2>\n\n<p>These patterns don’t replace our product documentation, they build on it. They provide the “why” and “how” behind many of the architectures we recommend, helping you avoid common pitfalls and deliver faster results with confidence.</p>\n\n<p>As our products evolve and new customer discussions take place, our library of patterns continues to grow. You can always access the full collection of Validated Patterns at <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/\">developer.hashicorp.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re working through challenging integrations or infrastructure transformations, we encourage you to check back as this collection evolves. If you would like to see a HashiCorp Validated Pattern on a specific topic or integration, please speak with your account team who will submit it on your behalf.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1747677245-validated-patterns-landing-page.png\" alt=\"HashiCorp\" />","author":"Dan Brown","siteTitle":"HashiCorp Blog","siteHash":"219aa6310b3388f2335eba49871f4df9581f2c58eaeb5e498363b54e835b7001","entryHash":"5571eb9d8232cd23fdfaac658389cc79edc7523b43f65589ef4a14e04bf1787d","category":"Tech"}
