Really, the only thing that carries over is the main Powerweave upper fabric that gives the shoes their name. And even that has been rewoven for greater durability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve just received the new shoes in to test.

It is generally less stretchy than knit uppers, offering more structure, but is still form-fitting. But it was susceptible to abrasion – quite quickly even for my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-rapha-explore-powerweave-gravel-shoes-deliver-on-stiffness-fit-versatility/\" target=\"_blank\">Explore Powerweaves</a>. Yet still, they were one of my favorite pairs of gravel shoes because of their comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what’s actually new? </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Key updates &amp; Tech details </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-and-gravel-bike-shoes_new-sock-collar-construction-detail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-and-gravel-bike-shoes_new-sock-collar-construction-detail.webp\" alt=\"2025 Rapha Pro Team Powerweave road cycling &amp; gravel bike shoes, sock-like fit detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-and-gravel-bike-shoes_new-sock-collar-construction-detail.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-and-gravel-bike-shoes_new-sock-collar-construction-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-and-gravel-bike-shoes_new-sock-collar-construction-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-and-gravel-bike-shoes_new-sock-collar-construction-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-and-gravel-bike-shoes_new-sock-collar-construction-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-and-gravel-bike-shoes_new-sock-collar-construction-detail-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-and-gravel-bike-shoes_new-sock-collar-construction-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-and-gravel-bike-shoes_new-sock-collar-construction-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest change comes from the soft knitted ‘sock collar’ construction. A conventional tongue is replaced with a soft, stretchy material that encircles the foot and closes the gap where the tongue would be. The sock fits snugly against your foot, but can still stretch out of the way to get in or out of the shoe. Then, a 6cm long padded insert in the sock weave of the virtual tongue evenly distributes pressure from the upper 3 thin Boa wires where you are likely to have the greatest tension.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>…on the road</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_top-view.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_top-view.webp\" alt=\"2025 Rapha Pro Team Powerweave road cycling shoes, top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_top-view.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_top-view-297x149.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_top-view-1536x768.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_top-view-120x60.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_top-view-768x384.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_top-view-2048x1024.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo/Rapha)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The road shoe features a completely new Powerweave structure that has a smoother overall texture, and is made of 100% recycled polyester. And it includes larger vent openings into its weave. It still uses the same 2 Boa Li2 setup with plastic-coated wires and plastic wire guides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Rapha Pro Team Powerweave road shoes still use a full carbon sole and Pebax plastic-reinforced heel cup construction, which looks unchanged besides a slightly tweaked heel tread.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight claim of just 227g per shoe, size 42.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>…on groad and off-road</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-bike-shoes_top-view.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-bike-shoes_top-view.webp\" alt=\"2025 Rapha Pro Team Powerweave gravel bike shoes, top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-bike-shoes_top-view.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-bike-shoes_top-view-297x149.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-bike-shoes_top-view-1536x768.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-bike-shoes_top-view-120x60.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-bike-shoes_top-view-768x384.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-bike-shoes_top-view-2048x1024.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo/Rapha)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The gravel shoe Powerweave structure is closer to its previous version, but looks to use more of the hard-wearing plastic-y TPU fibers on the outside, presumably to boost durability. Now 40% TPU and 60% recycled polyester for the gravel Powerweave. The Rapha Pro Team Powerweave gravel shoes also still use 2 Bo Li2 dials. Now they adopt plastic-coated wires (instead of the woven cord). But they still stick with more impact-resistant webbing lace guides, which now are tucked inside the Powerweave fabric.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-Vibram-MegaGrip-sole.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-Vibram-MegaGrip-sole.webp\" alt=\"2025 Rapha Pro Team Powerweave gravel bike shoes, new Vibram MegaGrip rubber outsole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-Vibram-MegaGrip-sole.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-Vibram-MegaGrip-sole-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-Vibram-MegaGrip-sole-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-Vibram-MegaGrip-sole-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-Vibram-MegaGrip-sole-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The gravel shoes feature an all-new full carbon (although not full-length in carbon) sole with new Vibram MegaGrip rubber for improved grip, especially on wet surfaces. The new sole feels as stiff as before. But the last ~5cm or so of the toes is more flexible, which helps hike-a-bike-ability without compromising pedaling efficiency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see at the toe of the shoe where the stiffer UD carbon ends and the more flexible sole construction takes over.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-toe-reinforcement.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-toe-reinforcement.webp\" alt=\"All-new Rapha Pro Team Powerweave gravel bike shoes review, new toe bumper and TPU protection\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-toe-reinforcement.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-toe-reinforcement-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-toe-reinforcement-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-toe-reinforcement-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-toe-reinforcement-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-toe-reinforcement-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_new-toe-reinforcement-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the most important functional upgrade in my mind is new toe protection. There’s a small rubber toe bumper that extends up a tiny bit from the new Vibram sole. But even more practical is a thin rubberized coating over the entire toe cap – the same as was already on the heel. This will do wonders for keeping the shoes looking fresh, even after plenty of hike-a-bikes. It probably will also help keep some water out, either from groad spray or that morning walk around camp in dewy grass.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_actual-weight-602g-pair.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_actual-weight-602g-pair.webp\" alt=\"All-new Rapha Pro Team Powerweave gravel bike shoes review, size 43.5 602g pair actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_actual-weight-602g-pair.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_actual-weight-602g-pair-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_actual-weight-602g-pair-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_actual-weight-602g-pair-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_actual-weight-602g-pair-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_actual-weight-602g-pair-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_actual-weight-602g-pair-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They also have the added benefit of being a full 15% lighter than before! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My size 43.5 shoes weigh just 602g for the pair  – 301g a piece, since that’s how shoes are often referenced.

And Rapha actually recommends sizing up 1/2 a size vs. the previous generation, which I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sock-like opening doesn’t open anywhere nearly as wide as the old shoes. I could stretch the opening a max 15 cm, while I could open the old shoe up to ~20cm. It is definitely harder to get the new shoes on &amp; off, so pretty much every time you’ll be pulling hard on the heel loop to get them on your foot. Hopefully that stretch will last over time, as the snug fit is quite comfortable once it is on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_sock-bunching.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_sock-bunching.webp\" alt=\"All-new Rapha Pro Team Powerweave gravel bike shoes review, bunched up sock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_sock-bunching.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_sock-bunching-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_sock-bunching-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_sock-bunching-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-gravel-cycling-shoes-Review_sock-bunching-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The other downside of losing the tongue is that the Boa wires bunch up the fabric a bit if you have a low-volume foot and wear thin socks. Also, there’s only a tongue pad under the 3 upper Boa wire crossings, so you may feel the 2 lower wire crossings against your forefoot. This shoe fits very snugly, though. You’ll likely not need to really lock those Boa dials down super tight, so it might not be a real issue in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rapha Pro Team Powerweave shoes – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_side.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_side.webp\" alt=\"2025 Rapha Pro Team Powerweave road cycling shoes, white\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_side.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_side-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_side-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_side-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_side-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Rapha-Pro-Team-Powerweave-road-bike-shoes_side-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo/Rapha)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapha just launched the new Pro Team Powerweave shoes today, and you can find them online now, whether you prefer <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/shop/pro-team-powerweave-road-shoes/product/BVI01XXWMC\" target=\"_blank\">road</a> or <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/shop/pro-team-powerweave-gravel-shoes/product/BVH01XXDRK\" target=\"_blank\">gravel</a> riding.
