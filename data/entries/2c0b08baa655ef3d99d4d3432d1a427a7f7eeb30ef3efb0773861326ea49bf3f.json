Foxconn is said to currently be assembling Apple AI servers that contain the ‌M2‌ Ultra, with plans to assemble AI servers powered by the M4 chip in late 2025. Last month, a reputable source on Weibo said that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-developing-its-own-ai-server-processor/\">working on processors for its own AI servers</a> made with TSMC's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a> process, targeting mass production by the second half of 2025, which may line up with this report about M4-powered AI servers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's decision to build its own AI server is reflective of the company's ongoing strategy to vertically integrate its supply chain. Apple will likely use its own chips to enhance the performance of its data centers and future AI tools that rely on the cloud.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Apple is rumored to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-acquires-french-ai-company/\">prioritizing on-device processing</a> for many of its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-working-on-on-device-llm/\">upcoming AI tools</a>, it is inevitable that some operations will have to occur in the cloud. By the time M4-based servers could be operational in data centers, Apple's new AI strategy should be well underway. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn line with broader industry expectations, Pu also expects Apple to announce on-device AI features at WWDC in June, such as audio recording summarization, photo and video editing, and live translation. While the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup will tout a range of AI features, 2025's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 17 models will apparently be more focused AI devices.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/\">Foxconn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/\">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-servers/\">Apple Reportedly Building M2 Ultra and M4-Powered AI Servers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-powered-ai-servers.2425557/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2c0b08baa655ef3d99d4d3432d1a427a7f7eeb30ef3efb0773861326ea49bf3f","category":"Apple"}
