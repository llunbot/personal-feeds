Not for when I landed the kickflip or pop shove-it down the stairset, but for when I bailed and had to land on my feet.</p>\n<p>Eventually, on days we skated stairs, I left my Vans at home and reached for shoes with more support. After trying various models, I found the Kareem Campbell Kicks by Duffs to be my ideal shoes – of course, these came out before “the internet,” so finding an old CSC catalog scan or magazine ad has proven to be impossible. The KCKs, which came in black or white, were much narrower than the Etnies/ES (although the Sal’s hit hard!) and Osiris shoes that were popular at the time. With their sleek silhouette, these shoes maintained exceptional support. Kareem Campbell was always the dude to send shit a bit bigger than others, so if he signed off on them, they had to be good enough for me!</p>\n<p>A part of me has been imprinted with moments from my youth. From the music I <em>still listen to</em> to the clothes I wear and shoes, I’m drawn to things that reflect those imprinted years. I’ll reach for <em>the thing</em> that looks like <em>the thing</em> I liked when I was 14 or 15. Every time. As I’m writing this, I’m listening to the same Swans LP I bought in high school… gahhhh.</p>\n<p>As such, I’m still drawn to black shoes with gum soles, and the Leatt ProClip 4.0 model jumped right out at me when I first saw them.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-02.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-02.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>ProClip 4.0 Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>$169 – <a href=\"https://leatt.com/us/shoe-proclip-4-0-v25.html\" target=\"_blank\">Leatt.com</a> and dealers</li>\n<li>Sizes: US 6-13</li>\n<li>Shoe weight: 625 g per shoe, including cleat and bolts</li>\n<li>MOZ and velcro closure system</li>\n<li>Long cleat adjustment bed</li>\n<li>Neoprene cuff</li>\n<li>Semi-Rigid Flex shank for maximum riding and hike-a-bike comfort</li>\n<li>Stabilizing and debris-blocking neoprene ankle collar</li>\n<li>Molded stabilizing heel and rigid reinforced toe area</li>\n<li>Active Carbon moisture wicking, quick dry, anti-bacteria, anti-odor material for comfort and hygiene</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-06.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-06.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-06.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-06.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Leatt Brief</h3>\n<p>Leatt’s an <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/existential-safety-leatt-at-20-a-conversation-with-dain-zaffke/\" target=\"_blank\">interesting brand that started with moto and moved into MTB</a>. Its modus operandi is all about making products that ensure spinal and brain health, initially specializing in neck braces. I don’t ride in terrain that merits heavy-duty protection, or perhaps I should say, I’ll always wear a helmet on singletrack but rarely pads. And I’m not big on bike parks, so I’ve never even worn a full-face or neck brace. Not saying it won’t happen, but at 43 years young, to think I’ll get into that sort of riding is a stretch.</p>\n<p>But I’m all about protecting these aging ex-skater ankles and feet!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-13.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>With Leatt’s move into cycling goods like shoes, the brand’s ProClip 4.0 hit the exact mark I was looking for with some winter footwear. I wanted a mid-top shoe with a neoprene cuff to keep stuff from entering inside the shoes. Thinking we’d have a snow-filled winter, one of the bummers of riding in a few inches of snow is the ingress of the wet stuff into your shoes, leading to wet socks. I’ll also get rocks and sand in my shoes in the warmer months.</p>\n<p>Turns out, we’ve had a VERY dry winter and while I didn’t have to worry about snow (which is scary for our forests),  the shoes are exceptional in keeping out sand and rocks. I’ve also found some other things along the way, so let’s get to it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-03.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-03.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>ProClip 4.0 Fit and Function</h3>\n<p>The ProClip 4.0 look just like my beloved KCKs growing up. Black uppers with a gum sole. They’re not super wide, nor are they too narrow. They’re just right for someone with skinny, boney feet. The upper is tall, giving your ankle what I would call mid-level support; they’re not hiking boots but not low-tops either.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-17.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-17.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-28.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-28.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Fox-Grip-X-Review-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I’ve used these shoes on everything from my mixed terrain rides on the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/meriwether-ponderosa-gravel-bike-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Ponderosa</a> to my <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/black-cat-bicycles-swami-rigid-29er-mtb-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Swami</a>, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/beautiful-builds-retrotec-funduro/\" target=\"_blank\">Funduro</a>, and <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/starling-cycles-murmur-v3-review/\" target=\"_blank\">both</a> full-suspension <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/cotic-flaremax-build/\" target=\"_blank\">bikes</a>. They look great on the bike, have tons of sole support, keep the rocks out, and easily slip on. The few long rides I’ve gone on this winter, my feet were comfortable, ventilated, and protected. And they don’t stink after lots of use.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-05.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-05.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-01.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-01.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-01.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Our trails are loose, steep, and rocky. Every ride has the inevitable hike-a-bike, and I’ve ridden in many shoes that just don’t have the grip to get up this stuff, causing me to pull the brake levers on the bike and side-shuffle up these steep pitches. Immediately, the RideGrip sole and lugs impressed with their traction. They’re the first non-Vibram sole cycling shoes that feel super grippy. Even pushing my bike up granite boulders in Tucson, I was impressed by the traction.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-10.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-10.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-16.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-16.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>To put them on, I’ll undo the strap, slide in, adjust my overall fit with the velcro strap first, and then turn the MOZ dial to give more or less support at the mid-body of the shoe.</p>\n<p>My heel feels well cupped and supported, there’s plenty of toe padding, and the neoprene cuff has kept my shoes rock and sand-free. The sole isn’t what I’d call overly stiff. It’s completely walkable, and when riding larger platform clipless pedals, it allows for grip on the pedal’s pins. This keeps my feet feeling secure in cornering, and you lose the “float” feeling when you’re locked into a line. You can see the outer pedal platform wear mark on the sole above.</p>\n<p>One clever detail is how Leatt places the MOZ system on the top of the foot, helping avoid rock strikes with a side-mounted dial. Then, on the side, there’s extra protection for when you slam into rocks. That rubber side padding also has a mesh window to help the shoes breathe.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-12.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>MOZ?</h3>\n<p>The shoe’s tension is made by the MOZ cable system, which is similar in functionality to BOA. There’s also a large Velcro strap that pulls across the upper. MOZ, like Leatt itself, originated in the motorcycle world. It’s the system Leatt uses on its shoes. The system is very similar to BOA, but the parts are not cross-compatible.</p>\n<p>While I’m not a die-hard MOZ or BOA fan, it looks like I could add laces to these shoes if I wanted to down the road. Or you could just try out the <a href=\"https://leatt.com/us/shoe-clip-4-0-v25.html\" target=\"_blank\">Clip 4.0</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-11.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Sole Notes</h3>\n<p>Cleat position is everything. And for me, I like having my cleats further back, rather than further forward and as outbound as they’ll go, with my toes pointed slightly out. Years ago I got a bike fit done and this is how my cleats got set up. Immediately, my knee issues disappeared and my hips felt better overall, especially when running or on backpacking trips.</p>\n<p>Leatt’s shoes have a very long cleat bed — the longest I’ve used. So, if you want a few more centimeters in either the fore or aft position, you’ll love the brand’s clipless models. Another notable feature is how robust the tread is. I’ve been riding these shoes since last fall, and they still have lots of life left.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-15.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Leatt-ProClip-4.0-Shoes-Review-15.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<p>Mountain bike shoes, like saddles, grips, and tires, are all preferential. But it’s worth noting when you find something that clicks in terms of function, aesthetics, and durability. I didn’t know what to expect from these shoes as they were my first introduction to the brand’s offerings.</p>\n<p>Leatt might not be as well-known in the States, but these ProClip 4.0 shoes exceeded my expectations. They keep my bony feet happy, my heel supported, my feet dry, free of debris, and are easy to adjust. These shoes have been through hell and back in our rocky terrain and look to have plenty more life left in ’em.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very supportive fit</li>\n<li>Look heavier than they are in reality</li>\n<li>Easy adjustment</li>\n<li>Neoprene cuff and tongue keep precipitation and sand out alike</li>\n<li>Long cleat adjustment bed</li>\n<li>Grippy sole</li>\n<li>Well ventilated</li>\n<li>Stiff enough to not get hot spots but plenty walkable</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leatt isn’t a common or well-known brand in the US, so your local shop might not carry them. BUT ASK ANYWAY! ;-)</li>\n<li>MOZ system isn’t BOA, and spare parts might not be as readily available</li>\n<li>$169 isn’t cheap, but it’s in the ballpark for trail shoes</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://leatt.com/us/shoe-proclip-4-0-v25.html\" target=\"_blank\">Leatt</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/leatt-proclip-4-0-shoes-review/\">Leatt ProClip 4.0 Shoes Review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"39acb76c4136d30702e1bc60008b89eca6a37d10ccb11bf7b06173fc6aafc22a","category":"Cycling"}
