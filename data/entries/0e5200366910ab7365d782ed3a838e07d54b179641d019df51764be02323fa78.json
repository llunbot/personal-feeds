A largely hobbyist base of users does all kinds of cool things with the playing-card-sized devices. For instance, a user in Manhattan could connect one to the Internet so that people in Madrid, Spain, or Sydney, Australia, could listen to AM radio broadcasts, CB radio conversations, or even watch lightning storms in Manhattan.\n<p>On Wednesday, users learned that for years, their devices had been equipped with a backdoor that allowed the KiwiSDR creator—and possibly others—to log in to the devices with administrative system rights. The remote admin could then make configuration changes and access data not just for the KiwiSDR but in many cases to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/raspberry-pi/\">Raspberry Pi</a>, BeagleBone Black, or other computing devices the SDR hardware is connected to.</p>\n<h2>A big trust problem</h2>\n<p>Signs of the backdoor in the KiwiSDR date back to <a href=\"https://github.com/jks-prv/Beagle_SDR_GPS/commit/6bdde32e603cc6ec745c779aed7d67c855e2342b\">at least 2017</a>. The backdoor was <a href=\"https://github.com/jks-prv/Beagle_SDR_GPS/commit/adfc0a7900f1f8b7aa1686840d48884b797c4384\">recently removed</a> under unclear circumstances. But despite the removal, users remain rattled since the devices run as root on whatever computing device they’re connected to and can often access other devices on the same network.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780666#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780666&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0e5200366910ab7365d782ed3a838e07d54b179641d019df51764be02323fa78","category":"Tech"}
