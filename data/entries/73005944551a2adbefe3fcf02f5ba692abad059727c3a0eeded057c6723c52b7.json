{"title":"Report: A new AirTag is coming next year but not much is changing","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2338605/airtag-update-2025-location-tracking-new-chip.html","date":1716225119000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>In the latest Power On Newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-19/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-summaries-cloud-and-on-device-llms-openai-deal-lwdj5pkz&amp;xcust=1-1-2338605-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that Apple will be upgrading the AirTag in the middle of 2025. The upgrade would be the first since the tracking device was released in April 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for what the upgrade will include, Gurman states it will have “a better chip with improved location tracking.” The current AirTag has Apple’s U1 chip, which uses ultra-wideband (UWB) technology to give a device with the chip spatial awareness. With the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2091512/iphone-15-pro-review.html\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, Apple released a second-generation UWB chip with better precision. So, it appears that Apple will update the AirTag with the new chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman doesn’t mention any other features, but he does say his personal wish list includes a louder speaker, better battery life, and a size that fits well in a wallet. Whether his wish list is his way of implying that these are possible features is not clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman also states that Apple is already doing test production runs of the new AirTag. A new AirTag seems like a good product to make available during the holiday shopping season, so if Apple is already doing a test run, perhaps the release schedule could move up to the latter part of this year. However, the original AirTag was released in April so a similar timeframe seems equally possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman’s report comes about eight months after a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1714685670210351166?&amp;xcust=1-1-2338605-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who said that production of the new AirTag has been pushed from <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1686754705693888512&amp;xcust=1-1-2338605-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">August 2024</a> to some time in 2025. Kuo did not provide a reason for the rescheduling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirTag is a disk-shaped Bluetooth device that is used as a tracker. It works with the Find My app that can be used to determine the approximate location of the items attached to the AirTag.
