Less familiar is the related notion of <em>mal du suisse</em> – the Swiss illness – a diagnosis given to Helvetian mercenaries laid low physically by a deep longing for their mountainous homeland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of homesickness as a medical affliction has fallen out of favour but, when confronted by the landscape of the Swiss Alps, it’s not hard to imagine how it might shape an identity or form an integral part of the national psyche. The mountains are awesome in the truest sense of the word – they inspire awe – because they exist on such a mind-altering scale. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/susten-pass-cycling\">Classic climb: Susten Pass, the supersized Swiss climb</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/grosse-scheidegg-cycling\">Classic climb: Grosse Scheidegg, the Swiss climb with a traffic-free cherry on top</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/furka-pass-cycling\">Classic climb: Furka Pass, the Swiss climb with the Midas touch</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>To cyclists, they hold their own special magnetism.

Situated in the southeast of the country close to the Italian border, the pass runs roughly north-south, joining the cantons of Graubünden and Ticino and bridging the German-Italian language divide at the same time. There are almost too many ways to approach this climb but we’re focussing on the ascent from the south, beginning in the town of Lostallo. It’s a giant of a climb including almost 1,700m of vertical ascent over 30km.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"San Bernardino Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The cobbles of Mesocco are smoother than most UK tarmac.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This is the harder side of the pass and arguably the more interesting, although neither approach is going to disappoint. You could of course ride over the entire San Bernardino and back again if you’re truly dedicated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting from Lostallo, there are immediately choices to make. You can plug away on the main road, but since you’re here for the experience, the lanes to the east of the large highway are the better option unless you’re itching to get to the proper climbing as quickly as possible. They offer welcome respite from the traffic, a little up-and-down rollercoaster through pretty farmland, with occasional goats, stone barns and picturesque bridges across the river Moesa, which flows the length of the valley.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"San Bernardino Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-04-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The detour ends at the village of Soazza where you’re back on the main road for a steady climb to Mesocco averaging around 6%-7%, passing its eponymous castle on your right.

By all means stick to the main road if you like – it offers a healthy complement of hairpins and classic near-perfect Alpine tarmac – but veering right towards the hamlets of Darba and Andergia takes you on a series of narrow lanes that snake their way upwards, twisting and turning with some seriously challenging gradients. Neither option is easy and the standard approach averages around 7% or 8%, with a peak that nudges up towards 12%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The route options come together again adjacent to junction 34 of the E43 highway. The cycling route is again a main road, but motorised traffic levels are kept in check by the tunnel alternative that runs through the mountain.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-06-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"San Bernardino Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-06-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The highway running almost in parallel to our route keeps the worst of the motorised traffic at bay.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Progress can feel slow at this stage as the wide road doesn’t give a great sense of forward momentum.

The views become more expansive by an order of magnitude and the landscape has a rawness to it that’s noticeable after the lushness of the lower reaches.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"San Bernardino Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-09-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-09.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Dense pine forests give way to scrubby, low-lying evergreen bushes pushing out of boggy ground and scattered formations of ageless rock. The atmosphere feels different up here. Even on a sunny summer’s day there’s a crispness to the air and a sense of remoteness. The mountains have weather all of their own and you can picture a blizzard suddenly closing in. Like most of the major passes, the road is impassable through the winter, typically from sometime in November to April or May.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-10-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"San Bernardino Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-10-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-10.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The ribbons of tarmac are delightful but the gradients stay mostly under 10% so the run to the finish isn’t punishing.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The final section of the climb is undoubtedly the best, with gloriously expansive views, including a satisfying perspective on the ribbon of tarmac you’ve traced your way up. A series of hairpins only enhances the sense that you’re finally getting somewhere. Here gradients hover around the 5%-7% mark with the usual kick up as you winch around a switchback, but it’s never unduly steep so it’s possible to maintain a decent pace.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"San Bernardino Pass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-11-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-11-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/classic-climb-san-bernardino-11.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A near-straight false flat offers the opportunity for some high-speed showboating if there’s anything left in your legs and then you skirt your way round a small lake to the finish. Like so many of these climbs the end of the affair can feel anticlimactic: admire the cows, eat some alarmingly expensive salami and bread at the not-quite-a-restaurant, and get back on your bike. Has your longing for the mountains been sated?
