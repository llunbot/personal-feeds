It’s a lightweight expandable pack with 3L of storage, including many easy access pockets, plus a 2L HydraPak reservoir inside developed to be quick &amp; easy to refill mid-race. As ultra-distance riders, bikepackers, and especially gravel riders look to carry more water, snacks &amp; spare clothes on their backs, light hydration vests are becoming more popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we strapped the new Canyon x Millet Sharp 3L vest on to test it out at The Traka.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon x Millet SHARP 3L lightweight hydration vest</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_packed.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_packed.webp\" alt=\"Review: Canyon + Millet Sharp 3L lightweight expandable hydration vest backpack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_packed.webp 2100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_packed-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_packed-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_packed-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_packed-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_packed-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_packed-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_packed-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Cory Benson)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon wanted to create a hydration pack for gravel riders to “<em>stay hydrated at race pace</em>” – that’s where the S.H.A.R.P. name comes from. So instead of starting from scratch, they decided to collaborate with alpine gear maker Millet who already produce dozens of lightweight packs and vests for adventure athletes like trail runners, climbers, and skiers. But to create a “cutting-edge race pack” specifically for cyclists, the Canyon team had a number of ideas how they would refine the perfect on-bike hydration vest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is the Canyon x Millet Sharp 3L hydration vest collab. A vest that is “<em>super light, breathable, comfortable and ultra-functional, packed with neat features and equipped with a 2L hydrapak reservoir</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon says that this is only the “<em>beginning of a promising collaboration between Canyon and Millet</em>“, suggesting we’ll see more technical gear to come out of the collaboration, even in the very near future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and paves the way for future innovative releases, blending the best of both brands. Stay tuned for more in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-x-Millet-Sharp-3L-hydration-vest_front-and-back-views-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-x-Millet-Sharp-3L-hydration-vest_front-and-back-views-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Canyon x Millet Sharp 3L hydration vest backpack, front &amp;

It’s open mesh to the outside, so my phone still got plenty wet in the heavy rain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fit &amp; First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_L-XL-fit-detail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_L-XL-fit-detail.webp\" alt=\"Review: Canyon + Millet Sharp 3L lightweight expandable hydration vest backpack, tight L/XL chest fit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_L-XL-fit-detail.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_L-XL-fit-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_L-XL-fit-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_L-XL-fit-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_L-XL-fit-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_L-XL-fit-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_L-XL-fit-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The two sizes available lean very much towards the thinnest cyclists. I am certainly larger than average for an endurance cyclist at 185cm tall, 85kg, and with a 102cm chest. But I am very close to the size limit possible with the L/XL. I ride with the lower strap as loose as possible, and it is already so snug that I cannot position it all the way to the bottom of its adjustable slides.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_dirty-detail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_dirty-detail.webp\" alt=\"Review: Canyon + Millet Sharp 3L lightweight expandable hydration vest backpack, still dirty\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_dirty-detail.webp 2100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_dirty-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_dirty-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_dirty-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_dirty-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_dirty-detail-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_dirty-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CanyonMillet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-expandable-hydration-vest-pack-review_dirty-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My lasting thoughts are that while I did sweat more with the Canyon x Millet Sharp 3L vest on vs. not wearing it, the extra water carrying was certainly worth it. And the Power Net fabric did dry quite quickly. The other point though is that the white mesh collects dust and mud. And it isn’t really easy to get 100% clean again after riding in really nasty conditions. I don’t mind the light-colored backpack, but wish the shoulder straps were any color other than white.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since I first tried it out, I’ve kept reaching for the Sharp when I want a light &amp; breathable hydration vest that combines extra water storage with a stable fit for rough off-road riding and a lot more storage options for extra food and spare clothing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon x Millet Sharp 3L vest – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-x-Millet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-hydration-vest-for-ultradistance-emndurance-gravel-cyclists.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-x-Millet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-hydration-vest-for-ultradistance-emndurance-gravel-cyclists.webp\" alt=\"Canyon x Millet Sharp 3L hydration vest backpack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-x-Millet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-hydration-vest-for-ultradistance-emndurance-gravel-cyclists.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-x-Millet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-hydration-vest-for-ultradistance-emndurance-gravel-cyclists-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-x-Millet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-hydration-vest-for-ultradistance-emndurance-gravel-cyclists-1536x853.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-x-Millet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-hydration-vest-for-ultradistance-emndurance-gravel-cyclists-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-x-Millet-Sharp-3L-lightweight-hydration-vest-for-ultradistance-emndurance-gravel-cyclists-768x427.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo/Canyon)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Canyon x Millet Sharp 3L hydration vest comes only in white, which is really about half black and half a mixture of white and light gray.
