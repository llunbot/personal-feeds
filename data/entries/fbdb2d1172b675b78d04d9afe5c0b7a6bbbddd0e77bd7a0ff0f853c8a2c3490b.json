The name can also now be attributed to stage 15 of the 2024 <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/vuelta-a-espana?srsltid=AfmBOopjGlZ9ghuKpxfl2_OPbXuAj7eisRw7pMhEnuPRqScrSenAJKom\">Vuelta a España</a>, a day where nothing that was predicted came to fruition. Despite all the expectations, Ben O’Connor is </span><em><span>still</span></em><span> in the lead of the race; Primož Roglič did </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> destroy his GC rivals; Enric Mas </span><em><span>beat</span></em><span> Roglič; the UCI then </span><em><span>deducted</span></em><span> Roglič 20 seconds; and Pablo Castrillo, the new hero of Spain who barely anyone knew anything about until last week, won </span><em><span>another</span></em><span> mountain stage. The only foreseen event that came to pass was that Mikel Landa briefly had the entire population of Spain frantically ringing their bosses to book next Monday off work to celebrate his impending Vuelta triumph, only to sputter and lose time. But, hey, Landismo is still alive at 3:05 back. It never dies.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>Where to begin? By applauding the race organisers for taking the peloton up the only climb in Europe that can rival the nearby Angliru as the most-feared and inhumane ascent? By questioning why Landa instructed his Soudal–Quick-Step – sorry, T-Rex Quick-Step, rawr – to set the pace on the front all day, relinquishing O’Connor’s exhausted Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale of pacing duties, only to then fail to capitalise? By wondering why Aleksandr Vlasov, pale and deathly at the end, didn’t drop back and assist Roglič on the devilish 24% ramps when his team leader desperately needed assistance? How many chapters are you commissioning for us, Netflix? </span></p>\n<p><span>Probably the most notable place to start is with O’Connor. After losing almost two minutes on Friday’s Puerto de Ancares, a leg-sapping ascent but which by comparison to Sunday’s Cuitu Negru was a beginner’s introduction to North West Spain’s Evil Cycling Climbs, it was feared that the Australian’s remaining advantage of one minute, 21 seconds to Roglič would finally be wiped out, perhaps before he even turned onto the final hellish three kilometres that took the riders up a winter ski slope. Yep, up a ski slope. In the Vuelta, they do </span><em><span>loco</span></em><span> things. This time, though, O’Connor’s legs matched his heart and desire. When Roglič accelerated at the onset of the 20%+ gradients, he was the first one to keep with him. As the ramps continued, the severity never abating, O’Connor eventually slipped back, but limited his losses to 38 seconds, meaning he will be in the red jersey at the start of the third week. It’s unlikely he’ll survive the three remaining mountain-top finishes and final day time trial, but until Roglič or someone else snatches </span><em><span>rojo</span></em><span> off him, the dream persists.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20240901VUE2022-Unipublic_Cxcling_Naike_Erenozaga.jpg?v=1725212617\" /></div>\n<p><span>And talking of Roglič. At the foot of the climb, he changed bikes to one with what can only be described as having mountain bike gearing. He’d spin his little legs all the way to the top, batter O’Connor into submission, and take back the leader’s jersey he believes is rightfully his. Well, that was the assumption. But that’s not what happened. Though the Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe rider was the first of the GC cohort to attack, and quickly built an advantage approaching 20 seconds, the savage gradients bit back </span><em><span>poco a poco.</span></em><span> Towards the end, Mas had recovered admirably after initially struggling up the narrow track and overtook the Slovenian, crossing the line ahead of him. An hour later, news filtered through that when Roglič changed bikes, he had drafted behind a team car. Tut, tut, naughty, naughty. A 20-second penalty. A 43-second deficit to O'Connor increased to 1:03. If Roglič is to win a fourth Vuelta, he’s still got work to do and has competition to match. Mas, 100 seconds in arrears of him, isn’t giving up hope of finally winning his home race that he’s finished second in three times.</span></p>\n<div><span></span></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<span>Wherever Mas finishes in Madrid next week, he’s earned a new legion of fans for being brave and attacking; for the first time, Spain is admiring the Mallorcan en-masse. He’s not the country’s new pearl though – that’s young Castrillo. Three days on from winning in Manzaneda, his first professional victory and the first Grand Tour triumph for his Kern Pharma team, the 23-year-old found himself in the break for the fifth time in the race, and rode like an experienced stage winner, sitting in the wheels, refusing to do any turns while Pavel Sivakov faced the fog head on, and then attacking just before the road’s gradient pointed skywards. As Vlasov was hunched over his bike, wrestling with it just to keep the wheels turning, Castrillo was in his saddle, fluid, elegant and victorious once again. </span><em><span>Que grande es</span></em><span>. That a second-tier rider has won this bonkers, chaotic race’s queen stage was the blockbuster finale of the least expected day. Siesta, anyone?</span>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"fbdb2d1172b675b78d04d9afe5c0b7a6bbbddd0e77bd7a0ff0f853c8a2c3490b","category":"Cycling"}
