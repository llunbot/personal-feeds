{"title":"Trump’s Dark Plans for a Second Term","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/05/trump-revenge-second-term/","date":1699384569000,"content":"\n<p>Isaac Arnsdorf, Josh Dawsey, and Devlin Barrett, reporting Sunday for The Washington Post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Donald Trump and his allies have begun mapping out specific plans \nfor using the federal government to punish critics and opponents \nshould he win a second term, with the former president naming \nindividuals he wants to investigate or prosecute and his \nassociates drafting plans to potentially invoke the Insurrection \nAct on his first day in office to allow him to deploy the military \nagainst civil demonstrations. </p>\n\n<p>In private, Trump has told advisers and friends in recent months \nthat he wants the Justice Department to investigate onetime \nofficials and allies who have become critical of his time in \noffice, including his former chief of staff, John F. Kelly, and \nformer attorney general William P. Barr, as well as his \nex-attorney Ty Cobb and former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. \nMark A. Milley, according to people who have talked to him, who, \nlike others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe \nprivate conversations. Trump has also talked of prosecuting \nofficials at the FBI and Justice Department, a person familiar \nwith the matter said. </p>\n\n<p>In public, Trump has vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to “go \nafter” President Biden and his family. The former president has \nfrequently made corruption accusations against them that are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/09/07/trump-biden-false-attacks-2024-presidential-race/\">not \nsupported by available \nevidence</a>. </p>\n\n<p>To facilitate Trump’s ability to direct Justice Department \nactions, his associates have been drafting plans to dispense with \n50 years of policy and practice intended to shield criminal \nprosecutions from political considerations. Critics have called \nsuch ideas dangerous and unconstitutional. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Trump and his supporters remain the biggest threat to America, and to the concept of liberal democracy itself, the world has ever seen. These are plans for a dictatorship, pure and simple.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/11/trump-plot-military-election/675922/\">Tom Nichols, writing at The Atlantic</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Trump is, to put it mildly, an emotionally disordered man. But \nsuch men are usually only a hazard to their families and \nthemselves, especially if they lack money or power. Trump has \nboth, but even more important, he has people around him willing to \nuse that money and power against American democracy. As the Post \nreport reveals, these henchmen are now trying to turn Trump’s \nravings into an autocratic program; without their aid, Trump would \nbe just another motormouthed New York executive living on \ninherited money and holding court over a charred steak while the \nrestaurant staff roll their eyes. With their support, however, he \nis an ongoing menace to the entire democratic order of the United \nStates. [...] </p>\n\n<p>The coalition of prodemocracy voters — I am one of them — is \nshocked at the relative lack of outrage when Trump says hideous \nthings. (The media’s complacency is a big part of this problem, \nbut that’s a subject for another day.) For many of us, it feels as \nif Trump put up a billboard in Times Square that says “I will end \ndemocracy and I will in fact shoot you in the middle of Fifth \nAvenue if that’s what it takes to stay in power” and no one \nnoticed. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/07/trump-dark-plans\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c220d81db87657448eb4d32615a504f6832a3f8e33ddf31c2ea8611cfd965e21","category":"Tech"}
