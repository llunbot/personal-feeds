While the iPad mini was updated on an annual basis between 2012 and 2015, the device has only been updated three times since then, including in March 2019, September 2021, and this month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has been gradually transitioning its products to OLED displays, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-new-ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro earlier this year</a>, so it would make sense for the iPad mini to eventually follow suit. Plus, an iPad mini with an OLED display has already been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/24/apple-developing-oled-ipad-mini-for-2026/\">rumored previously</a>, so it looks increasingly likely that such a device is on Apple's roadmap.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther devices rumored to get an OLED display include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-sourcing-iphone-se-oled-displays-report/\">new iPhone SE next year</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/2026-ipad-air-oled-panels-supplied-samsung/\">followed by the iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/macbook-pro-wont-switch-to-oled-in-2025-rumor/\">MacBook Pro in a few years from now</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYoung is the CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants, and he has a mostly-accurate track record with display-related information for future Apple products. For example, he was the first source to reveal the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/\">would feature 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays</a>, respectively, over a year before the devices launched.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/24/ipad-mini-8-oled-display-rumor/\">iPad Mini 8 Rumored to Feature OLED Display With These Benefits Likely</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-8-rumored-to-feature-oled-display-with-these-benefits-likely.2440852/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3c3b7af58ef55ddc6ca9a742b79a3c64e97cd96e2097d679b723cab521da75a0","category":"Apple"}
