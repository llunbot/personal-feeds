The former World Tour time trialist just launched <a href=\"https://cognitiveprotocol.com/\">Cognitive Protocol</a>, a new line of supplements aimed at helping people recover from concussions and manage long-term cognitive issues. Drawing from his own run-ins with traumatic brain injury during his pro days, Zabriskie says he and Scott Thomson built this system to offer tools for people dealing with post-concussion symptoms.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brain-injury-cte-concussion.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"753\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brain-injury-cte-concussion.jpg\" alt=\"Brain injuries are increasingly more common in all forms of cycling.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brain-injury-cte-concussion.jpg 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brain-injury-cte-concussion-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brain-injury-cte-concussion-297x224.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brain-injury-cte-concussion-768x578.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brain-injury-cte-concussion-600x452.jpg 600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brain-injury-cte-concussion-80x60.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brain-injury-cte-concussion-696x524.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brain-injury-cte-concussion-558x420.jpg 558w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Concussions Are Serious</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Zabriskie took more than a few head knocks in his racing career, and like many riders from his era, he’s spent the years since retiring looking for ways to undo the damage. <em>Cognitive Protocol</em> is his latest effort in that mission. Though it’s not his first foray into alternative wellness—he previously teamed up with another former professional (and admitted doper), Floyd Landis, at <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/build-cycle-podcast-029-floyd-landis-started-floyds-leadville/\" target=\"_blank\">Floyd’s of Leadville</a>—this latest brain-boosting stack fits a familiar narrative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“During my worst crash at Redlands, I woke up in a helicopter after being unconscious for 15 minutes,” said Zabriskie. “Back then, if you had no broken bones, you got back on the bike. The reality was, head injuries just weren’t properly understood or addressed.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Zabriskie who has partnered with “wellness innovator” Scott Thomson and “leading health experts” on the project, the formulation was developed with “targeted brain recovery” in mind, focusing on ingredients shown in early studies to potentially reduce inflammation and promote neuroregeneration. These are big claims, especially in a world where supplement science often moves more slowly than the marketing narrative behind it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who experienced more than a few concussions from hockey, bike racing, and skateboarding, I welcome any progress to help heal those affected. But proceed with caution, these are supplements which are not regulated like prescription drugs, and we recall the adage <em>“a fool and his money are soon parted”. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-full-support-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1180\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-full-support-.png\" alt=\"Cognative Protocol Stack full support\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-full-support-.png 1180w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-full-support--297x242.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-full-support--120x98.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-full-support--768x625.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in the Stack?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Zabriskie and his team aren’t throwing darts here—some of the compounds in <em>Cognitive Protocol</em> have decent supporting evidence, although most are far from conclusive.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA):</strong> Multiple animal studies have shown that fish oil can reduce neural inflammation after a concussion.<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19706506/\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Creatine:</strong> Not just for gym rats. There’s growing interest in creatine’s neuroprotective properties. It seems to have a resurgence recently (or I’m being targeted for “over 40 supplements”), and the benefits could outweigh (no pun intended) the slight water weight gain. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Branched-chain amino Acids (BCAAs):</strong> A 2014 study from the University of Texas showed that BCAA supplementation sped up recovery in concussed patients<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9438436/\" target=\"_blank\"> (source). </a>The results are promising but niche.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Magnesium and Choline:</strong> Both play key roles in neurotransmitter function and neuroplasticity. There’s theoretical support for their use post-TBI <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK209327/\" target=\"_blank\">(source),</a> but more research is needed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, there’s a <em>scientific thread</em> here, but most of it still falls into the “needs more evidence” category. Like many wellness protocols, Cognative Protocol walks the line between anecdotal success and rigorous science. Cognative Protocol offers some articles on its site about the link between its ingredients and research, but they are not extensive. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Floyds-of-Leadville-CBD-hemp-oil-pain-relief-img_9382_1024.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Floyds-of-Leadville-CBD-hemp-oil-pain-relief-img_9382_1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Floyds-of-Leadville-CBD-hemp-oil-pain-relief-img_9382_1024.jpg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Floyds-of-Leadville-CBD-hemp-oil-pain-relief-img_9382_1024-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Floyds-of-Leadville-CBD-hemp-oil-pain-relief-img_9382_1024-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Floyds-of-Leadville-CBD-hemp-oil-pain-relief-img_9382_1024-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Floyds-of-Leadville-CBD-hemp-oil-pain-relief-img_9382_1024-600x400.jpg 600w\" /></a><figcaption>Floyd and Dave Z at a Floyd’s of Leadville event.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Is Dave Z a Trusted Source?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Zabriskie isn’t a blank slate. In 2012, he admitted to doping as part of the USADA investigation into Lance Armstrong and the broader culture of systematic cheating in the pro peloton. He took a six-month suspension, lost some significant results, and helped to expose one of the most damaging chapters in cycling history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To his credit, Zabriskie didn’t duck the consequences. He cooperated, testified, and shifted his energy into healthier pursuits. That said, his past inevitably adds a layer of scrutiny to anything he puts his name on, especially a health-focused product promising to aid recovery from serious medical issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1190\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-.png\" alt=\"Cognative Protocol Stack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-.png 1190w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack--297x270.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack--120x109.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack--768x697.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How Does it Work? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The supplements are available in gel and powder form on the Cognitive Protocol page<em>.</em> The company offers a staggering number of products, from general “brain support” to “first response”, and hopes to support someone immediately after a head injury. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Here’s what stuck out for me in the lineup: </em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>First Response</em></strong><em>: Formulated for immediate support following a head injury, addressing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><em>PCS Core</em></strong><em>: Targets prolonged cognitive support needs and is suitable for ongoing mental demands or age-related cognitive maintenance.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><em>Concussion Support Kits</em></strong><em>: Available in Essential, Enhanced, and Premium versions (more or less product included), these kits are designed to support recovery following a concussion. </em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>The kits and supplements range from $20 to $220 for the most premium offerings. The top tier doesn’t get you a “better or enhanced version” of the supplements, but more of them. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-jug-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1190\" height=\"912\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-jug-.png\" alt=\"Cognative Protocol Stack jug\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-jug-.png 1190w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-jug--297x228.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-jug--120x92.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cognative-Protocol-Stack-jug--768x589.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A Skeptical Optimism</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Is Cognitive Protocol a magic bullet for concussion recovery? Not likely. But it might be a step in the right direction for those seeking options alongside traditional care. The supplement space—especially around brain health—is notoriously under-regulated, and what works for one athlete might not move the needle for another. At the very least, Zabriskie is bringing attention to a real issue far too common in sports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’re dealing with TBI or post-concussion symptoms, consult with a healthcare provider before jumping into any supplement regimen, especially one marketed online. We’re here to report, not advise on concussion protocol or supplements. There’s no shortcut to healing, but there’s value in being informed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://cognitiveprotocol.com\" target=\"_blank\">cognitiveprotocol.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cognitive-protocol-dave-zabriskie-concussion-recovery-gel-powder/\">Can a Gel Help with Concussion Recovery?
