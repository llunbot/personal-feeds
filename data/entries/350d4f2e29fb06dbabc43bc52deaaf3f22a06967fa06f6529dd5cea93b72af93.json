Now, there is apparently no such product in Apple's imminent product pipeline.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne complication was apparently the transition to OLED displays in the ‌iPad‌ lineup, which could invoke considerably higher costs on larger tablet displays. As <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/oled-ipads-2024/\">previously rumored</a>, the first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models are expected to top out at 13 inches when they go on sale in the first half of 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman was first to float the rumor of Apple designers and engineers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/07/massive-new-ipad-pro-could-replace-the-laptop/\">exploring iPads with bigger screens</a> that could further \"blur the lines\" between a tablet and a laptop. In January 2022, this was followed by the news that multiple suppliers, including BOE and LG, were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/17/lg-oled-ipad-panel-by-2024/\">converting factories</a> to be able to supply Apple with OLED displays <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/09/boe-oled-displays-for-tablets/\">around 15-inches in size</a> suitable for future ‌iPad‌ models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe leaker known as \"Majin Bu\" then claimed that Apple was working on an ‌iPad‌ with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/09/14-inch-ipad-pro-with-mini-led-display-rumored/\">14.1-inch display and the M2 chip</a> – a rumor corroborated by oft-accurate display industry analyst Ross Young, who added that the device would have a mini-LED display but no ProMotion for variable refresh rates up to 120Hz. In July last year, he amended his forecast, saying that Apple had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/apple-ipad-future-product-updates/\">switched to an LCD display</a> for the device, the likes of which are used on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn October 2022, <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma reported that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/26/16-inch-ipad-next-year-report/\">developing a 16-inch iPad</a> that it hoped to release in the fourth quarter of 2023. The prospective device would have approximately the same screen size as a 16-inch MacBook Pro, providing users with a significantly larger canvas to work with. Finally, Young said in December that Apple had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/14-1-inch-ipad-for-2023/\">shelved its plans</a> to launch a 14.1-inch ‌iPad‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite the tumultuous state of rumors about larger ‌iPad‌ models, Apple could still be interested in the prospect of launching such a device in the future. The biggest iPads that have been available since 2018 have been the 11-inch and 12.9-inch ‌‌iPad Pro‌. This means that the largest iPads are still smaller than the smallest MacBooks, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> MacBook Pro, which feature 13.3-inch displays. Since the 12.9-inch ‌‌iPad Pro‌‌ is already in a similar range to the 13.3-inch MacBooks and is rumored to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/oled-ipads-2024/\">increase to 13-inches next year</a>, it seems like just a matter of time before Apple offers a significantly bigger ‌iPad‌ model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em> has repeatedly discussed Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/27/apple-exploring-larger-ipads/\">interest in bigger iPads</a> and although the 14.1-inch ‌iPad‌ model that was in the works is now believed to be canceled, the 16-inch model last reported by <em>The Information</em> could still be in active development, although we have not heard anything about it for quite some time.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-ipad/\">14-Inch iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/apple-got-close-to-launching-14-inch-ipad/\">Apple Apparently 'Got Close' to Launching a 14-Inch iPad This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-apparently-got-close-to-launching-a-14-inch-ipad-this-year.2400347/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"350d4f2e29fb06dbabc43bc52deaaf3f22a06967fa06f6529dd5cea93b72af93","category":"Apple"}
