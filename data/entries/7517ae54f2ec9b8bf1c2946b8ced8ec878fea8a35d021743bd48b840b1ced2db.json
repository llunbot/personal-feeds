With today's iOS 17.2 release, Apple updated its ‌iOS 17‌ features list [<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17/pdf/iOS_All_New_Features.pdf\">PDF</a>] to note that the option to collaborate on playlists has been delayed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-collaborative-playlists.jpg\" width=\"5484\" height=\"3085\" />\r<br />\nApple tested collaborative playlists in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-beta-1-features/\">early iOS 17.2 betas</a>, but ended up removing the feature in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/ios-17-2-beta-4-features/\">fourth iOS 17.2 beta</a>. There were likely bugs in the option that Apple was not able to remedy in time to bring the feature to iOS 17.2, and as iOS 17.2 will be the last publicly available update to ‌iOS 17‌ in 2023, we won't be getting collaborative playlists until 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the iOS 17.2 beta, playlists gained a \"Collaborate\" option that created a link to a playlist, and anyone with access to that link was able to add to the playlist. Users had control over who was able to contribute, with an option to approve each person that asked to join and tools for removing users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is not clear when collaborative playlists in ‌Apple Music‌ might launch, but we will likely get an iOS 17.3 update in January, with testing to begin in December.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile collaborative playlists did not come in the iOS 17.2 update, Apple did add a Favorites ‌Apple Music‌ playlist that aggregates songs that are favorited.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-collaborative-playlists-2024/\">Apple Pushes Collaborative Apple Music Playlists Launch to 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pushes-collaborative-apple-music-playlists-launch-to-2024.2413408/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7517ae54f2ec9b8bf1c2946b8ced8ec878fea8a35d021743bd48b840b1ced2db","category":"Apple"}
