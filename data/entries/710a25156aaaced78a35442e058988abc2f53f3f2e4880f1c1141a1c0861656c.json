But today’s sale makes an incredible value too: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75NSLJY/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 15-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage for $1,049</a>, a savings of $250 and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 15-inch MacBook Air was introduced at WWDC and is Apple’s first 15-inch laptop since 2019.

You’ll also get a speedy M2 processor, all-day battery life, MagSafe for fast charging, two Thunderbolt ports, and the fantastic Magic Keyboard. And you’ll be all set for macOS Sonoma when it arrives on Tuesday.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1948603/15-inch-macbook-air-m2-review.html\">our 4.5-star review</a>, we loved the 15-inch MacBook Air’s “absolutely excellent processor” and “bright, sharp, and colorful” display.
