{"title":"Turn your iPhone into an Xbox gaming rig with $30 off the Backbone One controller","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/556034/backbone-one-iphone-controller-xbox-deal.html","date":1638110260000,"content":"<div>\n<section><div></div></section><p>The iPhone is quietly one of the most popular gaming devices on the planet, but if you want to take it to the next level, you need a controller. Amazon is selling the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-iOS-Mobile-Gamepad-Controller-Certified/dp/B08RL7VLKY?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Backbone One Mobile Gaming Controller with a free month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate included for $70</a>, a savings of $30 off the MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you pop your iPhone into the Backbone One Controller (iPhone 6s or later), you’ll be able to play any controller supported game. It features a dedicated button to launch the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343635/xbox-cloud-gaming-iphone-ipad-mac-game-pass-ultimate.html\">Xbox Cloud Gaming web app</a>, though you’ll need to take your iPhone out of your case to fit it in the controller properly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Backbone says you’ll need to request an adapter for “a better experience” on iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max models, but it should work without a hitch on all other models. The controller adds a 3.5mm headphone hack and a Lightning port for charging while you play. We haven’t tested the Backbone One controller, but it gets 4.5 stars on Amazon with more than 3,000 ratings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More Apple Cyber Monday Deals!</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/541154/cyber-monday-apple-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday Apple deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553299/cyber-monday-macbook-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday MacBook deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553913/cyber-monday-mac-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday Mac deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553018/cyber-monday-iphone-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday iPhone deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/555651/cyber-monday-magsafe-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday MagSafe charger and accessory deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/554337/cyber-monday-ipad-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday iPad deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553124/cyber-monday-apple-watch-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday Apple Watch deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553143/cyber-monday-airpods-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday AirPods deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/555374/cyber-monday-apple-tv-homepod-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday Apple TV and HomePod deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/552862/cyber-monday-airtag-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday AirTag deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553617/apple-cyber-monday-sale.html\">Apple Cyber Monday sale</a></li></ul>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"92857aebcacdac97c80fc3aebfdd9003a0ac01776e0aefd1b62dfddcbe2c3259","category":"Apple"}
