Like Office 2021 before it, Office 2024 will be part of Microsoft's Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC), which is intended for IT administrators and users who value stability and predictability over constant iteration.</p>\n\n<p>But Microsoft is being clearer than ever that it would really like people to move to using Microsoft 365 subscriptions, referring to Office 2024 as \"a specialty product that Microsoft has committed to maintaining for use in exceptional circumstances.\" The company will be increasing prices for businesses by \"up to 10 percent\" compared to Office 2021, a price hike that Microsoft says will \"support continued innovation in this niche space.\" Pricing for the consumer version of Office 2024 should stay the same as it is for Office 2021.</p>\n<p>Office 2024 will receive support and security updates for five years from its release date, which will be \"later this year,\" along with a new LTSC release of Windows 11. The company has also committed to releasing at least one more standalone version of Office in the future. If you bought Office 2021 and you're still happy with it, you'll still get support (including security updates) until October of 2026. Support for Office 2019 ended in October 2023.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011136#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011136&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bab42de95817a1d82cda5e42908d2fba7e5f3ff011b01417922e6df430fb2c3a","category":"Tech"}
