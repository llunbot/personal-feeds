Both are retired captains in the US Navy, served in war zones, and are veterans of previous six-month stays on the International Space Station.</p>\n<p>When they <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/after-a-successful-launch-boeings-starliner-runs-into-more-helium-leaks/\">launched to the space station</a> on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 5, the astronauts expected to be home in a few weeks, or perhaps a month, at most. Their minimum mission duration was eight days, but NASA was always likely to approve a short extension. Wilmore and Williams were the first astronauts to soar into orbit on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, a milestone achieved some seven years later than originally envisioned by Boeing and NASA.</p>\n<p>However, the test flight fell short of all of its objectives. Wilmore and Williams are now a little more than three months into what has become an eight-month mission on the station. The Starliner spacecraft was beset by problems, culminating in a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/after-latest-starliner-setback-will-boeing-ever-deliver-on-its-crew-contract/\">decision last month by NASA officials</a> to send the capsule back to Earth without the two astronauts. Rather than coming home on Starliner, Wilmore and Williams will return to Earth in February on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049775#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049775&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"53f85f9f82a98a48f67d42bd674ac081a3e19b7a9fd16321c1925abe8717195b","category":"Tech"}
