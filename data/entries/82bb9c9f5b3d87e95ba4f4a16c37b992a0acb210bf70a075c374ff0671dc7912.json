One group, calling itself Killnet, <a href=\"https://t.me/killnet/23\">said on Telegram</a> that “an attack was carried out on Ukrainian mobile operators, as well as on some banks,” but didn’t elaborate or provide any evidence. A separate group known as Solntsepek <a href=\"https://t.me/solntsepekZ/1283\">said</a> on the same site that it took “full responsibility for the cyberattack on Kyivstar” and had “destroyed 10,000 computers, more than 4,000 servers, and all cloud storage and backup systems.” The post was accompanied by screenshots purporting to show someone with control over the Kyivstar systems.</p>\n<p>In the city of Lviv, street lights remained on after sunrise and had to be disconnected manually, because Internet-dependent automated power switches didn’t work, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/ukraine-kyivstar-outage-down-russia-cyberattack-internet-phone-rcna129582\">according to</a> NBC News. Additionally, the outage prevented shops throughout the country from processing credit payments and many ATMs from functioning, the Kyiv Post <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/25421\">said</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991011#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991011&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"82bb9c9f5b3d87e95ba4f4a16c37b992a0acb210bf70a075c374ff0671dc7912","category":"Tech"}
