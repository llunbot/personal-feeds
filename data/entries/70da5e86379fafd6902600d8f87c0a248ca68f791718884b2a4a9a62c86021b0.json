Space Command said the event created more than 300 pieces of trackable debris. The military's ground-based radars are capable of tracking objects larger than 10 centimeters (4 inches).</p>\n<p>The culprit is the second stage of China's Long March 6A rocket, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/china-deploys-first-satellites-for-a-broadband-network-to-rival-starlink/\">lifted off Tuesday with the first batch of 18 satellites</a> for a planned Chinese megaconstellation that could eventually number thousands of spacecraft. The Long March 6A's second stage apparently disintegrated after placing its payload of 18 satellites into a polar orbit at an altitude of roughly 500 miles (800 kilometers).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041957#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041957&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"70da5e86379fafd6902600d8f87c0a248ca68f791718884b2a4a9a62c86021b0","category":"Tech"}
