If you have multiple devices signed in to the same Google account, the Play Store's \"install\" button will let you pick any of those devices as an installation target. If you find an app you like, it's great to queue up installs on your phone, watch, TV, tablet, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/02/samsungs-chromebook-pro-a-thoughtful-marriage-of-android-and-chrome-os/\">laptop</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/android-automotive-os-review-under-the-hood-with-googles-car-os/\">car</a>, all from a single device. It makes sense, then, that you might want to be able to uninstall apps from all your devices, too.</p>\n<p>The new feature coming to the Play Store will let you do exactly that: remote uninstalls from any device on your account. The first sign of the feature is in the latest <a href=\"https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/11412553?hl=en\">Android patch notes</a>, which list a \"New feature to help you uninstall apps on connected devices.\" It doesn't seem like this has been activated yet, but news site <a href=\"https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2023/12/Play-Store-Remote-Uninstall-Apps.html?m=1\">TheSpAndroid</a> has photos of the feature, showing what you would expect. Opening the Play Store and uninstalling an app will bring up a list of devices, just like installing does now.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_ORG_1702806801080.png\" /></div>\n          <p>\n            After hitting the \"uninstall\" button, this list of devices will pop up.

By default, the press of the Play Store install button requests Google to send an app push to your current device, but there's no need for the target device of a remote app install to be turned on and unlocked. Just like any other push notification, when the device connects to the Internet and sees the push, it will wake up and do whatever business it needs to doâ€”usually, that's \"show a message and beep,\" but in this case, that business is \"install an app.\" Google has slowly exposed its remote install functionality to the world, first with the Android Market (now Play Store) <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/02/hands-on-android-market-website-improved-still-lags-appbrain/\">website in 2011</a>. It took <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/09/helping-users-discover-apps-for-all-their-devices-from-their-phone.html\">11 years</a> for a similar feature to come to the Play Store phone app.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991955#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991955&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e2419e3c2207746b751ec0f7a744f4ece485b7f6a1e56d84ee9d74efc4622490","category":"Tech"}
