Facebook's advertising algorithms did not properly account for what the complaint calls Single Users with Multiple Accounts (SUMA), and the company thus \"systematically overcharg[ed] advertisers\" by misrepresenting the number of individual users, Haugen alleged.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801234#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801234&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"14f6c9fbf2102ac3cd2bd027da41307e2f615a4b192ab686191a1fdbb2b4214e","category":"Tech"}
