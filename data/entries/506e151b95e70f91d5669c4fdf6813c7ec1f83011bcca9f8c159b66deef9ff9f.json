First, there was 2020's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/review-the-old-guard-is-a-solid-thriller-whose-parts-dont-add-up-to-a-whole/\"><em>The Old Guard</em></a>, in which Charlize Theron leads an immortal group of mercenaries on a mission of revenge. Theron was terrific, but the film itself was uneven. Just last month, Netflix served up the disappointing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Milkshake\"><em>Gunpowder Milkshake</em></a>, which had a stellar all-star cast and all the right elements, including some impressive fight choreography. But as with <em>The Old Guard</em>, nothing really gelled, and as much as I love Karen Gillan, she seemed ill-suited to the role. <em>Gunpowder Milkshake</em> ended up feeling flat, predictable, and like an exercise in style over substance.</p>\n<p>The basic premise of <em>Kate</em> is a familiar one; it's essentially a twist on the classic 1950 film noir <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.O.A._(1950_film)\"><em>D.O.A.</em></a>, in which a man—a seemingly ordinary accountant and notary public—walks into a police station and says he has been poisoned, with only a few days left to live and discover who murdered him. (Due to someone not renewing the copyright on time, the film is in the public domain.) It has inspired three direct remakes: 1969's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Me_Dead\"><em>Color Me Dead</em></a>, 1988's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.O.A._(1988_film)\"><em>D.O.A.</em></a> (starring Dennis Quaid), and the 2017 film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5903088/\"><em>Dead on Arrival</em></a>. And the film has influenced countless more, such as the 2006 film <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank_(film)\">Crank</a>,</em> in which Jason Statham plays a British hitman who has to keep his adrenaline levels spiking to counteract being given a deadly poison.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785095#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785095&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"506e151b95e70f91d5669c4fdf6813c7ec1f83011bcca9f8c159b66deef9ff9f","category":"Tech"}
