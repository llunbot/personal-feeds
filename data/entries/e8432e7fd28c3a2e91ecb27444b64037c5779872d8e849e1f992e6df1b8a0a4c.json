Categories automatically sorts your emails into four distinct sections: Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. The change also adds contact photos and business logos for conversations in your inbox, but if you don't like how they look, it's easy enough to make them go away.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-mail-app.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nContact photos have been added to the Mail app in an effort to make it easier to identify the senders of all the emails you receive.
