(Read the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1364901/dl?inline\">complaint</a>.) The government claims this is fraud:</p>\n<blockquote><p>At bottom, DoD paid for military technology that Defendants stored in an environment that was not secure from unauthorized disclosure, and Defendants failed to even monitor for breaches so that they and DoD could be alerted if information was compromised. What DoD received for its funds was of diminished or no value, not the benefit of its bargain.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>AV hate</h2>\n<p>Given the nature of his work for DoD, Antonakakis and his lab are required to abide by many sets of security rules, including those outlined in <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r3.pdf\">NIST Special Publication 800–171</a>, \"Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045111#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045111&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c2770b09bdcdd71a980bf1098eebd1f1244131a3cf803ef142c2a889d51d61f8","category":"Tech"}
