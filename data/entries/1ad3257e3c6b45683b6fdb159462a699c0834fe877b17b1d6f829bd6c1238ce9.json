Gurman says that Apple plans to make the larger screen real-estate worthwhile by bundling it with new Apple Watch faces that utilize the larger displays.  \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>This year's watches will come in 41-millimeter and 45-millimeter sizes, up from 40 and 44 millimeters.

This will be the second time in the Apple Watch's history that the company has increased the display size, following the Apple Watch Series 4 in 2017. </blockquote>The new Apple Watch faces will be exclusive to the Series 7 and will likely not be made available through a software update for older models. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBesides cosmetic changes, the Apple Watch Series 7 is expected to include improved performance and battery life.
