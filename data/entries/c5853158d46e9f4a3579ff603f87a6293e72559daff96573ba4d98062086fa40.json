Of existing iPhone users surveyed, 63% said that Apple moving to a USB-C charging port would influence their decision to upgrade to an iPhone 15. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOf those that would be motivated to buy because of USB-C, the majority of iPhone users (37%) said they would upgrade because they would be able to use a single charging cable for iPhones, Macs, and iPads. Overall, 66% of iPhone users said that they will upgrade to an iPhone 15. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-users-upgrade-iphone-15.jpg\" alt width=\"1000\" height=\"408\" /><div><em>iPhone owners' responses when asked if they will upgrade to iPhone 15</em></div>\r<br />\nPerhaps the most surprising result of the survey was the number of Android users whose interest had been piqued by Apple's heavily rumored switch to the charging standard: 44% of existing Android owners surveyed said they would be tempted to buy an iPhone 15 if Apple adopts a USB-C port for the device. In the same group, 35% said their motivation stemmed from the fact that the iPhone would become compatible with chargers for non-Apple devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the cohort of existing Android fans, 66% overall said they would not be buying an iPhone 15, and 34% said they will potentially upgrade to the iPhone 15. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/android-users-upgrade-iphone-15.jpg\" alt width=\"1000\" height=\"408\" /><div><em>Android owners' responses when asked if they would be tempted to upgrade to a USB-C iPhone 15</em></div>\r<br />\nApple has kept the Lightning port on the ‌iPhone‌ for over 10 years. The company's proprietary charging port was introduced in September 2012 with the iPhone 5, but in recent years Apple's Macs and iPads have all transitioned to the more common USB-C charging standard. Apple's expected decision to switch the iPhone to USB-C this year was facilitated by pressure to comply with new regulations implemented in Europe for all consumer mobile and laptop devices to use a universal charging standard.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/what-not-to-expect-apple-september-iphone-15-event/\">What Not to Expect at Apple's 'Wonderlust' September 12 Event</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nApple is expected to unveil its new iPhone 15 lineup at its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/\">\"Wonderlust\" September 12 event</a>, alongside the Apple Watch Series 9 and a second-generation Apple Watch Ultra, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/28/iphone-15-apple-event-four-other-announcements/\">among other possible new products</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sellcell/\">SellCell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c-iphone/\">USB-C iPhone</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/usb-c-iphone-tempts-android-users-to-switch/\">USB-C iPhone 15 May Tempt Some Android Owners to Switch, Survey Suggests</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/usb-c-iphone-15-may-tempt-some-android-owners-to-switch-survey-suggests.2400581/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c5853158d46e9f4a3579ff603f87a6293e72559daff96573ba4d98062086fa40","category":"Apple"}
