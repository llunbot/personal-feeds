{"title":"Two Apple Self-Driving Cars Involved in Rear-End Collisions While in Manual Mode, Marking First Minor Incidents in Two Years","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/apple-self-driving-cars-minor-collisions/","date":1630525050000,"content":"Two of Apple's self-driving cars operating in manual mode were involved in minor collisions in August, according to the California DMV.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2017/08/applelexusselfdriving1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first incident [<a href=\"https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/apple_081921-pdf\">PDF</a>] occurred in San Diego, California in the Hillcrest area on August 19. The Lexus RX 450h was stopped in traffic and was hit by a Hyundai. The accident was described as minor with no injuries.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe second accident [<a href=\"https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/apple_082321-pdf\">PDF</a>] occurred on August 23 in Cupertino, California, right near the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/\">Apple Park</a> campus. The vehicle with Apple's self-driving equipment was in manual mode and it was stopped in traffic when it was rear ended by a Subaru Outback.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBoth of these incidents were not the fault of the self-driving vehicle or the person operating the vehicle, and are largely not notable. What is interesting, though, is that Apple vehicles were involved in two collisions in the same month after no accidents <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/apple-self-driving-cars-doubled-mileage-2020/\">since September 2019</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier this year, the California DMV's disengagement and mileage reports suggested that Apple's Lexus SUVs with self-driving software traversed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/apple-self-driving-cars-doubled-mileage-2020/\">more than 18,000</a> miles in 2020, a steep increase compared to prior years. It's possible that Apple has ramped up its testing in 2021, leading to a higher number of incidents.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has been testing its self-driving software since early 2017, using the aforementioned Lexus RX 450h vehicles outfitted with sensors and cameras. The work on autonomous driving is part of Apple's longtime car project, and rumors suggest Apple is planning to release a vehicle in the mid to late 2020s.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/apple-self-driving-cars-minor-collisions/\">Two Apple Self-Driving Cars Involved in Rear-End Collisions While in Manual Mode, Marking First Minor Incidents in Two Years</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/two-apple-self-driving-cars-involved-in-rear-end-collisions-while-in-manual-mode-marking-first-minor-incidents-in-two-years.2309458/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PTmA3H-MCFM:7P45WbHhyPo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PTmA3H-MCFM:7P45WbHhyPo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/PTmA3H-MCFM\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3f06a1faa3553978dd3c7ebee9a8e44fae69ba78cc055a077c0e4c0c326455d8","category":"Apple"}
