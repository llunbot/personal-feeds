Unlike my mountain bike-riding companion, I was on a gravel bike, the new Trek <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/checkpoint/checkpoint-sl/checkpoint-sl-7-axs-gen-3/p/47073/\">Checkpoint SL 7 AXS Gen 3</a>. You might be wondering why a review of a gravel bike is starting with such a ride. The answer is simple—the Checkpoint had excelled everywhere else I rode it, so I was curious to see how it would fare on a non-technical MTB track. Amazingly well, as it turns out.</p>\n<p>Unlike every other bike Ars has reviewed to this point, the Checkpoint SL 7 Gen 3 has no motor—there's no e- in this bike, as the only batteries are for shifting.. As is the case with our other bike reviews, sometimes we ask for a specific model, but manufacturers tend to contact us when we’ve already got a garage full of bikes we’ve not finished the reviews for (there are currently 12 bikes in my garage, some of which belong to other family members).</p>\n<p>Launched in 2018, the Checkpoint is Trek's gravel-centric bike.

The latter features a lighter-weight frame, a power meter, and SRAM's new <a href=\"https://www.sram.com/en/sram/road/series/red-xplr\">Red XPLR groupset</a>. Selling for $11,999, the Checkmate is a gravel racer. Priced several thousand less at $5,699, the Checkpoint SL 7 AXS is now Trek's top gravel bike for those looking for a fun day out on the trails.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/the-trek-checkpoint-sl-7-axs-gen-3-may-be-the-perfect-gravel-bike/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/the-trek-checkpoint-sl-7-axs-gen-3-may-be-the-perfect-gravel-bike/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Bangeman","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"beb7714941b96ed430125f10b487b9ed0ad3486d4749c71a7e6eac8cd2aea7aa","category":"Tech"}
