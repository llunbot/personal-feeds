Apple isn't selling a standalone case like they did with the move to wireless charging cases. <a href=\"https://t.co/XXANobWF4M\">https://t.co/XXANobWF4M</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7aNV0ysjrw\">https://t.co/7aNV0ysjrw</a></p>â€” Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1701798958723703144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 13, 2023</a></blockquote>  </div>\r<br />\nRegardless, the lack of an option to purchase the USB-C case separately is likely to frustrate customers who already own second-generation AirPods Pro with a Lightning port and plan to upgrade to an iPhone 15, which features a USB-C port for the first time. Those wanting to charge all their devices with one cable will need to buy the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-usb-c-lightning-adapter-and-more/\">USB-C to Lightning adapter</a> ($29), while those who want to future-proof for Apple Vision Pro compatibility will have to buy a completely new pair of AirPods Pro costing $249.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/\">USB-C</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/\">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/usb-c-airpods-pro-case-not-sold-separately/\">Apple Not Offering USB-C AirPods Pro Cases As a Standalone Purchase</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-not-offering-usb-c-airpods-pro-cases-as-a-standalone-purchase.2401420/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aeeaf6f6da57639ad878998771e4cfa204631f1bd81d13ff4695da09784777cc","category":"Apple"}
