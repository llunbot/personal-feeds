But if something’s not in stock, it gets a little trickier—employees send you to Apple.com to complete the purchase as if you were sitting in your living room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Mark Gurman that’s about to change. In the latest edition of his <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-23/apple-vision-pro-will-developers-sell-visionos-apps-for-the-3-499-device-lkfg5b1l&amp;xcust=1-1-2005866-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman reports that Apple will soon be offering home shipping through the Apple Store EasyPay checkout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shipping will likely be free for most items like the Apple online store. Apple offers free next-day delivery for in-stock iPhones, Macs, iPads, Apple Watches, and Apple TVs and offers free two-day delivery on most other products. It also offers same-day delivery for $9 if there is an Apple Store nearby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not clear whether the new system means Apple Stores will have less stock on hand or if it’s simply a way to make the shopping experience smoother. Gurman says the new system is expected to roll out next month just in time for the fall slate of new products.</p>\n\nApple Inc</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e58eb29547a66dfa2a970f2766902ee7787b5786598a33f7b42737b2697d53cf","category":"Apple"}
