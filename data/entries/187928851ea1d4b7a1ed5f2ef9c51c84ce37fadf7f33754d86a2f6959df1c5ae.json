The most noticeable alteration that will denote the new models is said to be a vertical rear camera arrangement to facilitate spatial video capture, but the removal of the mute switch in favor of the Action button introduced on last year's Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPhone 15‌</th>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPhone 16‌</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Diagonally arranged rear camera array</td>\r<br />\n <td>Vertically arranged rear camera array</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Ring/Silent switch</td>\r<br />\n <td>Action Button</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Thermal design with copper heatsink</td>\r<br />\n <td>New thermal design with graphene heatsink</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td><strong>iPhone 15</strong>: 171g weight\r<br />\n<strong>iPhone 15 Plus</strong>: 201g weight</td>\r<br />\n <td><strong>iPhone 16</strong>: 173g weight (+1%)\r<br />\n<strong>iPhone 16 Plus</strong>: 203g weight (+1%)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Cameras</h3>\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 16‌ models are slated to receive a small number of camera enhancements, such as an improved ultra wide camera, macro photography support, and a dedicated hardware button for photography and videography on the side of the device. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPhone 15‌</th>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPhone 16‌</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td>Capacitive \"Capture Button\" with force-sensitive half-press and sliding gestures to trigger photography and videography features</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Ultra wide camera with f/2.4 aperture</td>\r<br />\n <td>Ultra wide camera with f/2.2 aperture for improved-low light performance</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td>Macro photography support</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td>Spatial video capture</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Chip, Memory, and Connectivity</h3>\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 16‌ models are rumored to benefit from a moderate improvement in processing power thanks to an all-new A18 chip with a more powerful Neural Engine to support exclusive generative AI capabilities.

The ‌iPhone 16‌'s upgrades will likely not be as substantial as those offered by its predecessor. As a result, most ‌iPhone 15‌ users will have little reason to upgrade, but Apple Intelligence and the new Action and Capture buttons are likely to be among the main motivations to get the latest device.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-vs-iphone-16/\">iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 16: 20 Rumored Upgrades Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-vs-iphone-16-20-rumored-upgrades-compared.2419705/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"187928851ea1d4b7a1ed5f2ef9c51c84ce37fadf7f33754d86a2f6959df1c5ae","category":"Apple"}
