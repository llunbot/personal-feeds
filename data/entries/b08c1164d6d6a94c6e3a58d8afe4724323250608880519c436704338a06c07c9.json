It's a trend with several contributing factors—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/how-cities-can-stem-the-tide-of-pedestrian-deaths-from-large-cars-and-suvs/\">our built environment</a> prioritizes passenger vehicle traffic and encourages speeding, and traffic enforcement is virtually absent in many cities. But it's undeniable that vehicle design—particularly of large pickup trucks and SUVs—has been causing excess casualties. For example, a study published in January <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/higher-vehicle-hoods-significantly-increase-pedestrian-deaths-study-finds/\">found that an increase in hood height</a> of four inches (100 mm) translated to a 28 percent increase in pedestrian deaths.</p>\n<p>Today, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that vehicle design needs to change to reduce the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured in crashes. The notice of proposed rulemaking, which is open for public comment for the next 60 days, wants to harmonize federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) with a global standard already in effect in many countries around the world.</p>\n<p>\"We have a crisis of roadway deaths, and it’s even worse among vulnerable road users like pedestrians. Between 2013 and 2022, pedestrian fatalities increased 57 percent, from 4,779 to 7,522. This proposed rule will ensure that vehicles will be designed to protect those inside and outside from serious injury or death. We will continue to work to make our roads safer for everyone and help protect vulnerable road users,' said Sophie Shulman, NHTSA’s deputy administrator.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048357#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048357&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
