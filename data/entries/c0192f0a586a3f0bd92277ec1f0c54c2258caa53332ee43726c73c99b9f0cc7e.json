The more subdued green of the current green jersey looks nicer that in years past. And Cube &amp; Intermarché-Wanty have dialed that down eve further to create a paintjob that I could image many Litening Aero buyers would love as a pro replica.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-road-bike_detail-photos-by-CyclingMedia-Agency.jpg\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-road-bike_detail-photos-by-CyclingMedia-Agency.jpg\" alt=\"Biniam Girmay 2024 Tour de France Green Jersey winner on Cube Litening Aero TE C:68X aerodynamic road bike, details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-road-bike_detail-photos-by-CyclingMedia-Agency.jpg 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-road-bike_detail-photos-by-CyclingMedia-Agency-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-road-bike_detail-photos-by-CyclingMedia-Agency-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-road-bike_detail-photos-by-CyclingMedia-Agency-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-road-bike_detail-photos-by-CyclingMedia-Agency-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-road-bike_detail-photos-by-CyclingMedia-Agency-2048x1024.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos by Alessandro Volders/Cube)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rounding out the build, Biniam’s Cube Litening Aeroaero gets a complete Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 12-speed groupset.

With a 60mm deep front and 66mm deep rear rim, the latest aerodynamic wheels from Newmen are 22mm hooked internal and weigh just 1355g. That’s a wild weight claim for such a deep aero wheelset (610g front / 750g rear). Even more so, considering that they are adequately stiff for one of the world’s best sprinters. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_ultralight-Newmen-S6066-wheels-with-straighpull-carbon-spokes.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_ultralight-Newmen-S6066-wheels-with-straighpull-carbon-spokes.jpg\" alt=\"Biniam Girmay 2024 TdF Green Jersey winner, Cube Litening Aero road bike, with Newmen Streem S.60/66 ultralight wheels with Vonoa carbon spokes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_ultralight-Newmen-S6066-wheels-with-straighpull-carbon-spokes.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_ultralight-Newmen-S6066-wheels-with-straighpull-carbon-spokes-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_ultralight-Newmen-S6066-wheels-with-straighpull-carbon-spokes-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_ultralight-Newmen-S6066-wheels-with-straighpull-carbon-spokes-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_ultralight-Newmen-S6066-wheels-with-straighpull-carbon-spokes-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_ultralight-Newmen-S6066-wheels-with-straighpull-carbon-spokes-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_ultralight-Newmen-S6066-wheels-with-straighpull-carbon-spokes-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The stright-pull wheels are also surprisingly affordable, just <a href=\"https://www.newmen-components.de/Konfigurator?&amp;StuffId=b4e3880e-5d15-48dc-abf2-dc091bfc0f85\" target=\"_blank\">1690€</a> for the pair.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_oversized-valve-hole-but-removable-tubeless-valve.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_oversized-valve-hole-but-removable-tubeless-valve.jpg\" alt=\"Biniam Girmay 2024 TdF Green Jersey winner, Cube Litening Aero road bike, with Newmen Streem S.60/66 ultralight wheels with removable tubeless valve core\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_oversized-valve-hole-but-removable-tubeless-valve.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_oversized-valve-hole-but-removable-tubeless-valve-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_oversized-valve-hole-but-removable-tubeless-valve-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_oversized-valve-hole-but-removable-tubeless-valve-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_oversized-valve-hole-but-removable-tubeless-valve-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_oversized-valve-hole-but-removable-tubeless-valve-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biniam-Girmay-Tour-de-France-Green-Jersey-winner-on-Cube-Litening-Aero-TE-C68X-aerodynamic-road-bike_oversized-valve-hole-but-removable-tubeless-valve-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As usual for the team, Biniam is racing with one of the Intermarché-Wanty mechanic’s secret tricks.
