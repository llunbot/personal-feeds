{"title":"New – Amazon EC2 R7iz Instances Memory-Optimized for High CPU Performance, Memory-Intensive Workloads","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-r7iz-instances-memory-optimized-for-high-cpu-performance-memory-intensive-workloads/","date":1694115649000,"content":"<p>Today we’re announcing general availability of the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/r7iz/\">Amazon EC2 R7iz instances</a>. R7iz instances are the fastest 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable-based (Sapphire Rapids) instances in the cloud with 3.9 GHz sustained all-core turbo frequency. R7iz instances are suitable for workloads where there’s a requirement for more memory to process additional data, larger sizes of instances to scale up, higher compute and memory performance to reduce completion times, and higher networking and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/\">Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)</a> performance to improve latency. The high compute performance of the R7iz instances, combined with a large amount of memory, results in increased overall performance for applications that include front-end electronic design automation (EDA), relational database workloads with high per core licensing fees, and financial, actuarial, and data analytics simulation workloads. This can help you speed time to market for product development while reducing licensing costs.</p> \n<p><span><strong>R7iz Instances</strong></span></p> \n<p>The specs for the R7iz instances are as follows.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td></td> \n   <td><strong>vCPUs<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Memory (GiB)<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Network Bandwidth<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>EBS Bandwidth<br /> </strong></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>r7iz.large</strong></td> \n   <td>2</td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5 Gbps</td> \n   <td>Up to 10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>r7iz.xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5 Gbps</td> \n   <td>Up to 10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>r7iz.2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5 Gbps</td> \n   <td>Up to 10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>r7iz.4xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5 Gbps</td> \n   <td>Up to 10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>r7iz.8xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>256</td> \n   <td>12.5 Gbps</td> \n   <td>10 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>r7iz.12xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>48</td> \n   <td>384</td> \n   <td>25 Gbps</td> \n   <td>19 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>r7iz.16xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>512</td> \n   <td>25 Gbps</td> \n   <td>20 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>r7iz.32xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>1024</td> \n   <td>50 Gbps</td> \n   <td>40 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>You can attach up to 88 EBS volumes to each R7iz instance; by way of comparison, the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/z1d/\">z1d instances</a> allow you to attach up to 28 volumes.</p> \n<p>We are also getting ready to launch two sizes of bare metal R7iz instances:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td></td> \n   <td><strong>vCPUs<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Memory (GiB)<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Network Bandwidth<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>EBS Bandwidth<br /> </strong></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>r7iz.metal-16xl</strong></td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>512</td> \n   <td>25 Gbps</td> \n   <td>20 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>r7iz.metal-32xl</strong></td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>1024</td> \n   <td>50 Gbps</td> \n   <td>40 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p><strong> </strong><strong><span>Built-in Accelerators<br /> </span></strong>R7iz instances also include four built-in accelerators: Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX), Intel Data Streaming accelerator (DSA), Intel In-Memory Analytics Accelerator (IAA), and Intel QuickAssist Technology( QAT). Some of these accelerators require the use of specific kernel versions, drivers, and/or compilers. The Advanced Matrix Extensions are available on all sizes of R7iz instances while the Intel QAT, Intel IAA, and Intel DSA accelerators will be available on the <strong>r7iz.metal-16xl</strong> and <strong>r7iz.metal-32xl</strong> instances (coming soon).</p> \n<p><span><strong>Available Now</strong></span><strong><br /> </strong>R7iz instances are generally available today in the US East (N.
