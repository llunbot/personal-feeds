For some people, though, those drawbacks may be easier to live with than switching to a tubeless system.</p>\n<h2>What are the pros and cons of latex and TPU inner tubes?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Different types of bicycle inner tubes on scales\" title=\"Latex_butyl_TPU_inner tubes\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Latex and TPU tubes are both lighter than typical butyl tubes and can match tubeless setups for rolling efficiency.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<h3>Latex inner tubes – pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Very low rolling resistance</li>\n<li>Lightweight</li>\n<li>Better ride quality</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Latex inner tubes were traditionally used inside the fastest tubular tyres. A <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tubes-tubeless-or-tubular-2/\">tubular tyre</a> sees the casing wrapped around an inner tube, and then sewn closed. The tyre is then glued to the rim.</p>\n<p>Latex rubber is both lighter and more flexible than butyl rubber, which results in latex tubes producing much less rolling resistance.</p>\n<p>According to testing by UK-based performance consultants, <a href=\"https://www.aero-coach.co.uk/inner-tube-rolling-resistance\" target=\"_blank\">AeroCoach</a>, for example, the difference in performance between Vittoria Competition latex inner tubes and Continental Race 28 butyl inner tubes is 7.1 watts (for a pair of wheels, measured at 45km/h).</p>\n<p>Given butyl inner tubes can vary significantly in terms of weight, it’s hard to put a figure on the exact weight saving you can expect by switching to latex tubes.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vittoria latex inner tube\" title=\"20230822_SvB_X-E3_DSF2224\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Latex inner tubes offer reduced rolling resistance and weight.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Of our sample tubes, a Vittoria Competition latex inner tube (size 700×25/28c) weighed 73g, compared to 119g for a standard Schwalbe butyl tube (size 700×18/28c).</p>\n<p>That’s a saving of 46g per tube.</p>\n<p>Considering Vittoria latex inner tubes cost £14.99 each, you’d be hard pressed to find a better-value performance upgrade for your bike, if you’re still using standard butyl tubes.</p>\n<p>In our experience, latex inner tubes also provide a tangible improvement to ride feel.</p>\n<p>Where butyl inner tubes (especially cheap ones) can make a set of tyres feel wooden, good tyres fitted with latex inner tubes gain an appreciable zing to their ride quality (they even make a nicer sound as you roll along).</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Latex and butyl inner tubes on scales\" title=\"Latex_butyl_inner tubes\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A Vittoria latex inner tube is 46g lighter than a standard Schwalbe butyl inner tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<h3>Latex inner tubes – cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>More expensive than butyl tubes</li>\n<li>Poor air retention</li>\n<li>Extra care required during installation</li>\n<li>Susceptible to damage from heat build-up in rims</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main downside is latex inner tubes cost more than butyl ones.</p>\n<p>The Continental Race 28 inner tube mentioned earlier, for example, has an RRP of £7.50 and can typically be found online for less.</p>\n<p>Latex rubber is also more porous than butyl, meaning latex tubes lose air much more quickly. Where you might need to pump up butyl inner tubes just once a week or so, latex tubes will need reinflating before every ride to maintain <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/road-bike-tyre-pressure/\">optimum tyre pressures</a>.</p>\n<p>Because they’re lighter and more flexible, latex inner tubes are more delicate than butyl ones too.</p>\n<p>As a result, you need to be careful when installing them, particularly if you’re <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-change-a-bike-tyre/\">working with a tight tyre</a>, because they can be damaged easily if pinched by the tyre against the rim.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Park Tool GP-2 Super Patch kit on a Vittoria latex inner tube\" title=\"20230822_SvB_X-E3_DSF2232\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Latex inner tubes may be tricky to repair, but we’ve had luck with Park Tool’s GP-2 Super Patch kit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Traditional <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-fix-a-puncture-video/\">puncture repair kits</a> also aren’t strictly designed for latex inner tubes, though some of our team have had decent luck with both old-school glue on patches and the pre-glued type (such as Park Tool’s GP-2 Super Patches).</p>\n<p>Lastly, latex inner tubes are more susceptible to damage from heat. For this reason, most manufacturers recommend against using latex inner tubes in carbon wheels designed for rim brake bikes, especially for any rides that involve heavy sustained braking (such as on long descents, where prolonged braking can cause heat build-up in the rims).</p>\n<p>With the advent of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road disc brakes</a>, however, that’s likely less of an issue for many riders.</p>\n<h3>TPU inner tubes – pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Super-light</li>\n<li>Low rolling resistance</li>\n<li>Very compact</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TPU inner tubes have only become available in recent years, with Schwalbe being one of the first to market in 2020 with its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/schwalbe-aerothan/\">Aerothan TPU tubes</a>.</p>\n<p>The plastic used to make TPU inner tubes is significantly lighter and more flexible than butyl.</p>\n<p>As with latex tubes, this can help to cut weight from your bike and lower rolling resistance.</p>\n<p>In the same test, AeroCoach found TPU inner tubes rival latex ones for efficiency, with a set of Schwalbe Aerothan tubes saving 5.6 watts at 45km/h compared to the Continental Race 28 tubes.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vittoria TPU inner tube\" title=\"20230822_SvB_X-E3_DSF2226\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> TPU inner tubes are incredibly light and compact, and can almost match latex inner tubes for speed.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In terms of weight, a 700×25/30c Vittoria Ultra Light Speed TPU tube, for example, weighs just 30g.</p>\n<p>That represents a saving of 43g per tube compared to the Vittoria latex tubes, and 89g per tube compared to the Schwalbe butyl tubes.</p>\n<p>While Vittoria says its TPU tubes should only be used in disc brake wheels, Schwalbe and Pirelli both say their TPU tubes can be used in rim brake wheels.</p>\n<p>This, combined with the low weight of TPU tubes, makes them a strong choice on paper for riding in mountainous terrain.</p>\n<p>TPU tubes are also typically very compact when folded, making them a good option as a spare or emergency tube, if you’re tight on space.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vittoria TPU inner tube on a set of scales\" title=\"20230822_SvB_X-E3_DSF2220\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Inner tubes don’t come much lighter than this.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<h3>TPU inner tubes – cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Not quite as efficient as latex inner tubes</li>\n<li>Relatively expensive compared to both latex and butyl inner tubes</li>\n<li>Potentially difficult to repair with standard patches</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you care about every last few tenths of a watt, then TPU inner tubes are typically still marginally less efficient than latex ones.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, TPU inner tubes are more expensive and potentially harder to repair than butyl tubes.</p>\n<p>Vittoria’s Ultra Light Speed TPU tubes, for example, cost £29.99 – twice the cost of its latex tubes, and almost four times the price of the Continental Race 28 butyl tube.</p>\n<p>Whether standard puncture repair patches are able to repair TPU inner tubes is also unclear.</p>\n<p>Vittoria includes a puncture repair patch, which looks almost identical to a Park Tool GP-2 pre-glued patch with its TPU tubes.

This is particularly true on narrower rims, where the tube prevents the tyre beads from dropping into the deepest part of the channel on the rim (which reduces the amount of slack you have to work with).</p>\n<h2>Can I use latex or TPU inner tubes with hookless rims?</h2>\n<p>It’s worth noting that if you have a wheelset with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/hookless-rims-road-tubeless/\">hookless rims</a> then you must use tubeless tyres, because clincher tyres require rims with bead hooks to prevent blow-offs.</p>\n<p>You can use inner tubes with tubeless tyres on hookless rims, but, as discussed in the previous section, this isn’t always an ideal option.</p>\n<section>\n    <div>\n        \n<h2>Are latex or TPU tubes worth it for everyday riders?</h2>\n<p>If you care about the performance of your bike, then yes.</p>\n<p>If you ride off-road more regularly, on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/all-road-bikes-explained/\">all-road</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike/\">mountain bike</a>, then for most at BikeRadar the balance tips more decisively towards tubeless.</p>\n<p>For road, however, it’s less clear cut.</p>\n<p>I still use clincher tyres and basic butyl inner tubes on my commuter bike because they’re cheap, easy and I don’t need to pump them up every day.</p>\n<p>On any bike I use for fun, though, upgrading what’s inside the tyres would always be one of the first upgrades I’d look to make.</p>\n<p>Tubeless can be fantastic – the ability to self-seal small punctures while you ride can feel like a marvel – but if you don’t already have a tubeless-ready wheelset it’s perhaps not worth the cost of upgrading on its own.</p>\n<p>Given tubeless sealant needs to be topped up from time to time, too, it’s not a fit-and-forget option either.</p>\n<h2>You don’t have to pick a side</h2>\n<p>Whatever your view on the subject, it’s important to remember you don’t need to pick a side, or be all-in on one system or the other. Different bikes and riders have different requirements, and that’s no bad thing.</p>\n<p>I currently use a combination of butyl tubes and tubeless setups across my bikes, depending on what the main purpose of each bike is.</p>\n<p>But I still keep a few sets of latex inner tubes on hand to use when I don’t have enough time (or simply can’t be bothered) to set some new tyres up tubeless.</p>\n<p>Were I building up a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2022-hill-climb-bikes/\">hill climb bike</a>, a set of lightweight clincher tyres and featherweight TPU tubes would be an obvious pick.</p>\n<p>Of course, tubeless can be great, but in terms of rolling efficiency it’s not a clear winner once latex or TPU inner tubes are factored in.</p>\n<p>Given this, if you feel tubeless is too much hassle but you still want a fast and light setup, then it’s worth trying either option out.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>","author":"Simon von Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"7c2592deac9cffdcec5639cbfcecacfa5be3b65ec5ece74fe0337a3a4598484a","category":"Cycling"}
