Today's announcement of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/\">ChatGPT-4o</a>—which lets users converse with a chatbot using real-time audio and video—might seem like a mere lateral evolution of that basic interaction model.</p>\n<p>After looking through <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/openai\">over a dozen video demos</a> OpenAI posted alongside today's announcement, though, I think we're on the verge of something more like a sea change in how we think of and work with large language models. While we don't yet have access to ChatGPT-4o's audio-visual features ourselves, the important non-verbal cues on display here—both from GPT-4o and from the users—make the chatbot instantly feel much more human. And I'm not sure the average user is fully ready for how they might feel about that.</p>\n<h2>It thinks it's people</h2>\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/945587876\">this video</a>, where a newly expectant father looks to ChatGPT-4o for an opinion on a dad joke (\"What do you call a giant pile of kittens? A meow-ntain!\"). The old ChatGPT4 could easily type out the same responses of \"Congrats on the upcoming addition to your family!\" and \"That's perfectly hilarious. Definitely a top-tier dad joke.\" But there's definitely much more impact to <em>hearing</em> GPT-4o give that same information in the video, complete with the gentle laughter and rising and falling vocal intonations of a lifelong friend.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024129#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024129&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"df662a91e70e0fe74b01e5255cb722a94501770cb2500e5beda2d8e91af3b31c","category":"Tech"}
