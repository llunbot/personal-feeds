Being hyped as the “world’s strongest hydraulic disc brakes” at the time, they also turned out to be both incredibly expensive and incredibly hard to get a hold of. It wasn’t unheard of to hear about 9-12 month lead times if you wanted to purchase a set of Trickstuff brakes. Fast forward to 2022, and DT Swiss <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dt-swiss-buys-trickstuff-in-bid-to-expand-eu-development-production-capabilities/\" target=\"_blank\">acquired Trickstuff</a>, with what seemed pretty much like a primary goal of making it easier for consumers to get ahold of a set of Trickstuff brakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of years late and seems like that’s worked. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_right-brake-lever.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_right-brake-lever-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"Trickstuff Maxima Black MTB brakes First Look, now actually available, brake lever\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_right-brake-lever-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_right-brake-lever-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_right-brake-lever-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_right-brake-lever-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_right-brake-lever.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_front-brake.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_front-brake.jpg\" alt=\"Trickstuff Maxima Black MTB brakes First Look, now actually available, front brake\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_front-brake.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_front-brake-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_front-brake-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_front-brake-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_rear-brake.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_rear-brake-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"Trickstuff Maxima Black MTB brakes First Look, now actually available, rear brake\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_rear-brake-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_rear-brake-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_rear-brake-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_rear-brake-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_rear-brake.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From a technical perspective, the only real new feature of the Trickstuff Maxima Black brakes is that they are black vs. the original silver &amp; orange. Trickstuff already offered their long-running, most popular <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/eb15-trickstuff-makes-worlds-lightest-star-nut-plus-lighter-more-powerful-brake-levers-more-nifty-upgrades/\" target=\"_blank\">Direttissima</a> in mix-and-match silver and/or black anodized finishes. And their lightweight <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/eb16-trickstuff-piccolas-tiny-size-makes-lightest-hydraulic-mtb-brake-ever/\" target=\"_blank\">Piccola Carbon</a> brakes also come in shiny silver or black. Now their top gravity brakes get stealthy in all-black too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_cockpit-on-Formula-Belva-fork.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_cockpit-on-Formula-Belva-fork.jpg\" alt=\"Trickstuff Maxima Black MTB brakes First Look, now actually available, cokcpit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_cockpit-on-Formula-Belva-fork.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_cockpit-on-Formula-Belva-fork-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_cockpit-on-Formula-Belva-fork-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_cockpit-on-Formula-Belva-fork-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_cockpit-on-Formula-Belva-fork-768x384.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One other small recent update is that the Maximæ also now get a 5mm black Kevlar hose option, too. That’s important for a lot of modern bikes (<em>like mine</em>) because their standard Goodridge braided steel hoses measure 6mm in diameter and oftentimes will not fit inside bikes with guided internal cable routing. Trickstuff used to offer a bare 5mm braided hose without an outer plastic coating, but is happier with the new 5mm Kevlar hoses. In either case, Trickstuff assures that the Kevlar hoses deliver the same braking power, just a slightly different bite point feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_studio.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_studio.jpg\" alt=\"Trickstuff Maxima Black MTB brakes First Look, now actually available, studio shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_studio.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_studio-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_studio-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_studio-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_studio-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 4-piston Trickstuff Maxima brakes are CNC-machined in Germany from 7075 aluminum, and now everything anodized black.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They feature a 9mm diameter master cylinder pump with low-friction Polyoxymethylene (POM) plastic pistons, and ball-bearing pivoting brake levers with tool-free reach adjust.

Trickstuff also says the made-in-Germany low-viscosity Bionol has a higher boiling point than conventional mineral oil or DOT fluid. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_4-pistons-hollow-stainless-steel.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_4-pistons-hollow-stainless-steel.jpg\" alt=\"Trickstuff Maxima Black MTB brakes First Look, now actually available, how stainless piston detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_4-pistons-hollow-stainless-steel.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_4-pistons-hollow-stainless-steel-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_4-pistons-hollow-stainless-steel-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_4-pistons-hollow-stainless-steel-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_4-pistons-hollow-stainless-steel-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_4-pistons-hollow-stainless-steel-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_4-pistons-hollow-stainless-steel-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the 2-piece calipers held together with steel bolts, there’s a combination of 16mm &amp; 17mm hollow stainless steel pistons, optimized for equal braking pressure through both pairs of pistons and reduced heat transfer from pads to the actual braking system hydraulics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two-piece clamshell bar clamps also feature optional Matchmaker or I-Spec adapters to mount modular shifters or remotes for a clean cockpit.

Their bleeding process though is quite fiddly, and I would think most mountain bikers willing to pay this much for a brakeset should be willing to pay a professional to install them and setup them up on your bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_super-all-mountain-Scott-Ransom-endurop-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_super-all-mountain-Scott-Ransom-endurop-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Trickstuff Maxima Black MTB brakes First Look, now actually available, super enduro riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_super-all-mountain-Scott-Ransom-endurop-bike.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_super-all-mountain-Scott-Ransom-endurop-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_super-all-mountain-Scott-Ransom-endurop-bike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_super-all-mountain-Scott-Ransom-endurop-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_super-all-mountain-Scott-Ransom-endurop-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_super-all-mountain-Scott-Ransom-endurop-bike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trickstuff-Maxima-Black-mountain-bike-brakes-are-now-actually-available_first-look-review_super-all-mountain-Scott-Ransom-endurop-bike-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The feel at the lever almost felt too light at first, making me think I might have needed to rebleed them or something.

Technically there are 5 different combinations of black vs. silver brakes, and Goodridge braided steel lines in raw/black/carbon effect or black Kevlar hoses. And then you pick which lever to actuate which brake. All options are available now, and should be able to be sourced through your local DT Swiss dealer bikeshop in a relatively short time span.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-trickstuff-maxima-mtb-brakes-now-available-in-black-and-now-actually-available/\">First Look: Trickstuff Maxima MTB Brakes Now Available in Black, and Now Actually Available!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"500f3e75f57432be08c3a0bc52144a24f55dfd3e767d50c51cd9f3fa35e90125","category":"Cycling"}
