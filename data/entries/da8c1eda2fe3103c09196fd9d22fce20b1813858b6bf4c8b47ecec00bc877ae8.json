It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!,” reads a\nJavaScript alert shown on the compromised archive.org site.</p>\n\n<p>The text “HIBP” refers to is the <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">Have I Been Pwned</a> data breach\nnotification service created by Troy Hunt, with whom threat actors\ncommonly share stolen data to be added to the service.</p>\n\n<p>Hunt told BleepingComputer that the threat actor shared the\nInternet Archive’s authentication database nine days ago and it is\na 6.4GB SQL file named “ia_users.sql”. The database contains\nauthentication information for registered members, including their\nemail addresses, screen names, password change timestamps,\nBcrypt-hashed passwords, and other internal data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As if that weren’t enough to make for a bad week for the Internet Archive — a seemingly irreplaceable stalwart resource of the web — they’re also under a DDoS attack. <a href=\"https://mastodon.archive.org/@textfiles/113279179271574005\">Jason Scott, archivist at Internet Archive, on Mastodon</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Someone is DDOSing the internet archive, so we’ve been down for\nhours. According to their twitter, they’re doing it just to do it.\nJust because they can. No statement, no idea, no demands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/10/internet-archive-hacked-and-attacked\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"da8c1eda2fe3103c09196fd9d22fce20b1813858b6bf4c8b47ecec00bc877ae8","category":"Tech"}
