That would be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop\"><em>Cowboy Bebop</em></a>, a stylish, genre-busting neo-noir space Western that earned universal acclaim when it debuted in 1998. Count yours truly among its many admirers. So I had some reservations about Netflix's decision to adapt the original into a live-action streaming series—why mess with perfection?</p>\n<p>Diehard purists likely won't be happy; the new series is a different beast. But I found that Netflix's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop_(2021_TV_series)\"><em>Cowboy Bebop</em></a> mostly struck a balance between preserving the most beloved elements of the anime and remixing them in fresh, intriguing ways for a new dramatic format. Is it flawless? Hardly. But it's still pretty darn entertaining.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for the 1998 anime series below. Some spoilers for the live-action series, but no major reveals—except for one smallish one at the very end. We'll give you a heads-up when we get there.)</strong></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814568#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814568&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"052d8be5f194d446178229e7e57eed3bc856423b713f0a274f733b2e521444ff","category":"Tech"}
