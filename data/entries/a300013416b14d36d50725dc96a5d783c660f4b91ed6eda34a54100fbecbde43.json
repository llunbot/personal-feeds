Bose's super-comfortable <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JOGu6T\" target=\"_blank\">QuietComfort 45</a> noise-cancelling headphones are currently on sale for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JOGu6T\" target=\"_blank\">$280</a> ($330), while Apple's two most widely recommendable iPads, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3TnHVfu\" target=\"_blank\">iPad Air</a> (10.9-inch, 64GB) and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cjlsBDMd5Sh\" target=\"_blank\">iPad Mini</a> (8.3-inch, 64GB), are on sale for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3TnHVfu\" target=\"_blank\">$500</a> ($560) and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cjlsBDMd5Sh\" target=\"_blank\">$400</a> ($500), respectively. Both iPad deals match the lowest prices we've tracked for these models. Do note that you'll receive the discount at checkout on Amazon's iPad Air deal.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3TnHVfu\" target=\"_blank\">Apple iPad Air, 10.9-inch 64GB for $500 ($560)</a></h3>\n<p>Apple's iPads are the best tablets you can buy, and the latest iPad Air is the best for most people. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/2022-ipad-air-review-m1-other-tablets-0/\" target=\"_blank\">In our review</a>, we noted that, in addition to the beautiful screen for media consumption, the M1 processor also gives it more power than it has any business having if you need to do a little bit of work. It's also a well-equipped device for video calls, utilizing a 12 MP front-facing camera with Apple's Center Stage technology to digitally assist in keeping you the main focus on video. Pair this with <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JQuJNm\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Pencil</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/42nXvf8\" target=\"_blank\">Magic Keyboard</a> compatibility, and it becomes harder to justify spending hundreds more on an <a href=\"https://amzn.to/40ixfkS\" target=\"_blank\">iPad Pro</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924950#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924950&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a300013416b14d36d50725dc96a5d783c660f4b91ed6eda34a54100fbecbde43","category":"Tech"}
