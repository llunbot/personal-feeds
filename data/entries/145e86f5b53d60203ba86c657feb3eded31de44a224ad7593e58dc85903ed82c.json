{"title":"Apple's Phil Schiller to Serve as OpenAI Board Observer as Part of iOS 18 AI Agreement","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/02/apple-schiller-openai-board-observer/","date":1719954845000,"content":"Apple Fellow and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> chief <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/\">Phil Schiller</a> will take on a board observer position at OpenAI, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-02/apple-to-get-openai-board-observer-role-as-part-of-ai-agreement\">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple has been granted an observer role as part of its agreement with OpenAI, which will see ChatGPT integrated into <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a>, and Schiller has been selected for the role.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/open-ai-logo.jpg\" width=\"1093\" height=\"615\" />\r<br />\nA board observer is an informal board position where the participant is able to attend and contribute to board meetings, but is not allowed to vote and has no control. OpenAI has also given a board observer role to Microsoft, so Apple and Microsoft will be on even footing with Schiller's new position.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI, future board meetings could cover new arrangements between OpenAI and Microsoft, which <em>Bloomberg</em> suggests could cause tension if Schiller is present. Microsoft can request that Schiller be excluded from these meetings, however.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSchiller has not yet attended any OpenAI board meetings and is not set to do so until later in the year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple and OpenAI's deal will see <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> able to hand complicated user requests over to ChatGPT with explicit user permission. OpenAI is not paying Apple to integrate ChatGPT in its operating systems, nor is Apple paying OpenAI. No money is being exchanged under the terms of the arrangement at the current time.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/02/apple-schiller-openai-board-observer/\">Apple's Phil Schiller to Serve as OpenAI Board Observer as Part of iOS 18 AI Agreement</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-phil-schiller-to-serve-as-openai-board-observer-as-part-of-ios-18-ai-agreement.2430565/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"145e86f5b53d60203ba86c657feb3eded31de44a224ad7593e58dc85903ed82c","category":"Apple"}
