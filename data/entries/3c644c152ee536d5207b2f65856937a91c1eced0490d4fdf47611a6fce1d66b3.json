According to Apple, it combines classic Angry Birds slingshot gameplay with arcade-style brick-breaker mechanics.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's full description of the game:<blockquote>Join Red, Chuck, Bomb, and the rest of the gang on a brand-new adventure. Angry Birds Bounce combines the classic charm of Angry Birds with an innovative arcade brick-breaker twist. When the pigs take over their islands, the birds must bounce back — literally — combining into powerful flocks and launching themselves to defeat an army of piggies and reclaim their home. With strategic rogue-lite gameplay, each level is a new challenge where players will master precision shots, unlock exciting power-ups, and build unique combos during each run.</blockquote>All four games that are coming to Apple Arcade on July 3:<ul><li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds-bounce/id6462195757\">Angry Birds Bounce</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kingdom-rush-alliance-td/id6741771054\">Kingdom Rush 5: Alliance TD+</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/suika-game/id6741622025\">Suika Game+</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scribble-scrubbie-pets/id6744193586\">Crayola Scribble Scrubbie Pets+</a></li></ul>More details about all of the games are outlined <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-arcade-welcomes-nine-new-games/\">in Apple's announcement</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also highlighted <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/apple-arcade-games-coming-in-june/\">five games that are launching on Apple Arcade today</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccessible through the App Store, Apple Arcade is a subscription-based service that provides access to hundreds of games across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro, all free of ads and in-app purchases.
