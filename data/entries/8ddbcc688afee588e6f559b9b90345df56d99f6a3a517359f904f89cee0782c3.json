Perhaps a bit surprisingly, Sunday will mark Pogačar’s first career start in the Worlds TT event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However things go for the Slovenian selection this weekend, Roglič and Pogačar will join forces a week later, riding alongside Luka Mezgec, Matej Mohorič, Domen Novak, Jan Polanc, and David Per in the road race.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/olympic-tt-champ-roglic-wont-race-worlds-tt/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"8ddbcc688afee588e6f559b9b90345df56d99f6a3a517359f904f89cee0782c3","category":"Cycling"}
