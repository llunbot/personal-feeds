The work of going out to eat every\nnight with hand-chosen groups of friends and family sounds\nsuspiciously like what other people do on vacation. If you happen\nto work in New York or another major city, your beat is almost\nunimaginably rich and endlessly novel. [...]</p>\n\n<p>So we tend to save our gripes until two or three of us are\ngathered around the tar pits. Then we’ll talk about the things\nnobody will pity us for, like the unflattering mug shots of us\nthat restaurants hang on kitchen walls and the unlikable food in\nunreviewable restaurants.</p>\n\n<p>One thing we almost never bring up, though, is our health. We\navoid mentioning weight the way actors avoid saying “Macbeth.”\nPartly, we do this out of politeness. Mostly, though, we all know\nthat we’re standing on the rim of an endlessly deep hole and that\nif we look down we might fall in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s a funny thing about getting older. You put on weight yet you can’t eat nearly as much as you used to. Somehow, though, here in Philly, Craig Laban has been The Inquirer’s restaurant critic since 1998, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/author/laban_craig/\">and he’s still going strong</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Good critics — whether their beat is food, movies, books, whatever — review every genre, with an open mind. Some of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/dining/favorite-reads-by-pete-wells.html\">Wells’s best writing</a> was about the most approachable restaurants. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/16/dining/hamburger-america.html\">This recent review of Hamburger America</a> makes me hungry just glancing at it. His <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-guys-american-kitchen-bar-in-times-square.html\">scathing review of Guy Fieri’s American Kitchen &amp; Bar</a> is famous, but don’t miss <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/dining/senor-frogs-review.html\">his review of the unsurprisingly-now-closed Señor Frog’s in Times Square</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Señor Frog’s is not a good restaurant by most conventional\nmeasures, including the fairly basic one of serving food. One\nnight I got just two of the half-dozen appetizers I had asked for.\nAnother time, the starters showed up on schedule, but after nearly\ntwo hours the main courses still had not appeared.</p>\n\n<p>“What happened to our food?” we finally asked.</p>\n\n<p>“That’s what I’m wondering!” our server said brightly. “Like,\nwhere is it?”</p>\n\n<p>Getting just half of what you order at Señor Frog’s can be a\nblessing if it’s the right half.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/17/pete-wells-nyt\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5bf82498e6a6ea3287ac48f0205d3e5ff8850c5ddb4409eed7fb2fedd6d3738b","category":"Tech"}
