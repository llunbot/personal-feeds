When it launched in 1989, it was with the idea that a car could combine Japanese reliability with the luxury and power expected from a big German sedan. A few years later the RX basically invented the crossover category with SUV-like looks but with fewer of the handling compromises.</p>\n<p>I'll be frank—I haven't always jelled with those crossovers. During the last couple of years we tested both the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/not-sporty-enough-not-efficient-enough-the-2023-lexus-rx-500h-f-sport/\">RX 500h F Sport</a>, which I didn't find that sporty or particularly efficient, and the battery-electric <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/lexus-2023-rz-450e-disappoints-offering-poor-ev-range-and-a-bumpy-ride/\">RZ 450e</a>, which left me very cold. Third time is evidently the charm, because I got on much better with the topic of today's review, the RX 450h+ Luxury, to give it its full name.</p>\n<p>This is Lexus' plug-in hybrid version—the 500h carries a much smaller battery that only recharges as the car drives. In fact, it's the same plug-in hybrid powertrain as that found in the smaller, cheaper NX crossover, combining a 2.5 L four-cylinder gasoline engine and a pair of electric motors fed by an 18.1 kWh lithium-ion battery pack. Total power output is 304 hp (227 kW), but Lexus has declined to publish a combined torque figure or any outputs for the electric motors.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050059#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050059&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
