The space had doors with magnetic locks, unlocked by a powered relay. My partners and I realized that, if we could switch power to the system on and off, we could remotely control the door lock. One of us had a first-generation Wemo plug, so we hooked that up, and then the programmer among us set up a script that, passing Python commands over the local network, switched the door lock open and closed.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it would occur to me that it was kind of weird that, without authentication, you could just shout Python commands at a Wemo and it would toggle. I'm having the same feeling today about a device that's one generation newer and yet also possesses fatal flaws.</p>\n<p>IoT security research firm Sternum has discovered (<a href=\"https://cve.report/CVE-2023-27217\">and disclosed</a>) a <a href=\"https://sternumiot.com/iot-blog/mini-smart-plug-v2-vulnerability-buffer-overflow/\">buffer overflow vulnerability in the Wemo Mini Smart Plug V2</a>. The firm's blog post is full of interesting details about how this device works (and doesn't), but a key takeaway is that you can predictably trigger a buffer overflow by passing the device a name longer than its 30-character limit—a limit enforced solely by Wemo's own apps—with third-party tools. Inside that overflow you could inject operable code. If your Wemo is connected to the wider Internet, it could be compromised remotely.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939645#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939645&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a55cc355429c72ba653f516ee69f4aee40e07df24825a5c1cf10b66ec4187653","category":"Tech"}
