Leaked renders said to be based on CAD drawings have depicted iPhone-12 style flat curves, a thinner Digital Crown, and new speaker design on the left side of the watch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/91mmobile-apple-watch-series-1.jpg\" /><em><div>Apple Watch Series 7 render from 91Mobiles</div></em>\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em> says the Apple Watch will have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/apple-watch-7-thinner-display-borders/\">thinner display bezels</a> with the display using a new lamination technique that brings it closer to the front cover, and with this new casing and display technology, the upcoming models are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/26/first-45mm-apple-watch-band-spotted/\">expected to come</a> in 41mm and 45mm sizes, just a bit larger than the current 40mm and 44mm size options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe display of the 45mm model measures in at 1.8 inches according to rumors, up from the 1.73-inch display in the prior model. We don't yet know the size of the 41mm model, but it's likely to see a similar small size increase.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRumors have been mixed on thickness. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that the Apple Watch could be a bit thicker overall, but not in a way that's noticeable to users, but leaked renders suggested it would be 1.7mm thinner, which is a decent thickness decrease. We'll have to wait to see on the exact casing dimensions.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is rumored to be considering <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/prosser-apple-watch-series-7-design/\">new color options</a> for the Series 7 and it could come in a green aluminum shade. Last year, Apple introduced the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a> in blue aluminum.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nInside, the Apple Watch Series 7 will feature an upgraded S7 chip that could use double-sided technology to cut down on its size. The smaller S7 chip could leave more room for additional battery life and other components, and the new Apple Watch is expected to gain improved wireless connectivity and a better U1 Ultra Wideband chip.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere's a possibility that we could get a new, more durable version of the Apple Watch this year. <em>Bloomberg</em> says that Apple is considering a rugged version of the Apple Watch that's aimed at athletes, hikers, and others who are more likely to damage their Apple Watches. It's not clear if this model is coming in 2021 or 2022, though.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs for new software, the Apple Watch Series 7 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-8/\">will run watchOS 8</a>, which adds Focus mode, new Mindfulness features, Home and Wallet improvements, and more. Apple will also add new \"Time to Run\" and \"Audio Meditation\" features that will join the \"Time to Walk\" feature released earlier this year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBased on past launch dates, the most likely date for the event that will see the unveiling of the Apple Watch Series 7 and the ‌iPhone 13‌ models is Tuesday, September 14, but the week after that is also a possibility. Either way, we don't have much longer to wait before Apple reveals the first of its fall device launch lineup.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/27/apple-watch-series-7-what-to-expect/\">What to Expect From the Apple Watch Series 7</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-the-apple-watch-series-7.2308939/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nQkaFf2uk0I:Wi5VhpF5tI0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nQkaFf2uk0I:Wi5VhpF5tI0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/nQkaFf2uk0I\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b29af9bd175e214ed9eef4561dff803976903d89b52295a3cb3e1564bfa5f329","category":"Apple"}
