The Verge's Tom Warren <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24054329/microsoft-edge-automatic-chrome-import-data-feature\">reports</a> that he and multiple other users on social media and Microsoft's support forums have suddenly found their Chrome browsing sessions mysteriously replicated in Edge.</p>\n<p>Without an official comment from Microsoft, Warren posits that the tab-snatching happened because of a bug or an inadvertently clicked-through dialog box that triggers a feature in Edge that's meant to make it easier to (intentionally) switch browsers. The setting, which can be accessed by typing edge://settings/profiles/importBrowsingData into the browser's address bar, offers to import recent browsing data from Chrome every time you launch Edge, as opposed to the one-time data import it offers for Firefox.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/edge-data-import.png\"><img alt=\"The setting in question, as seen on a Windows 11 23H2 system running Edge 122.

I encountered two of these while installing Chrome on a PC for this piece—one when I navigated to the Chrome download page and another across the top of Edge's Settings pages after I had set another browser as my default.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999891#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999891&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"72258b6d46c166f7ea6bb5586b50273d723780b07bbd046c5436f34edee2ec1d","category":"Tech"}
