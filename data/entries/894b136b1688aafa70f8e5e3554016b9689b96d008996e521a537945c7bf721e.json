When configuring the machine with the following highest specifications possible, the pricing breakdown is as follows:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n    <li>Apple M3 Ultra chip with 32-core CPU, 80-core GPU, and 32-core Neural Engine: +$1,500</li>\r<br />\n    <li>512GB of unified memory: +$4,000</li>\r<br />\n    <li>16TB of storage: +$4,600</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nCustomers can also purchase Final Cut Pro ($299.99) and/or Logic Pro ($199.99) at Apple's checkout, which if chosen would result in a cost totaling $14,598.98.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says the M3 Ultra is the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip/\">fastest Mac chip it has ever released</a>, thanks to its strategy of fusing two M3 Max chips together using the company's \"UltraFusion\" technology.
