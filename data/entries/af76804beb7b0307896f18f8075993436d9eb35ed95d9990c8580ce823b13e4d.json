According to the rumor, Apple will provide users with support for a 25W power adapter this fall, and with it, it will release its own 25W power adapter as an accessory for purchase. Apple's current 20W power adapter <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHJA3AM/A/20w-usb-c-power-adapter?fnode=7fd34a64dee668a06c8f57729435cea45563b2b621ceaa0a390f2ceef0d6810ec177ded3543b269c6ffbca4d5fbc0ce0ba2c2207d0aed9a5faa2e4c88fdf18ac448fc803d930a0caed7941c9a958f2b3178f03468cdd06c70473f15709e8f0f689663bc5505aff9b06f0e2a533152d4f\">retails for $19.99</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCompared to 20W, 25W won't bring a drastic change to charging speeds or typical day-to-day charging for users. Many flagship Android smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S21, already support 25W. Support for the faster-charging speeds will come alongside increased battery capacities for each of the ‌iPhone 13‌ models, which will come in handy on the higher-end variants due to more advanced displays.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max are expected to benefit from LTPO displays, which will not only provide users with a better viewing experience with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate</a> but may <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/18/iphone-13-always-on-display/\">support always-on functionality</a>. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/23/iphone-13-may-support-25w-fast-charging/\">iPhone 13 May Support 25W Fast Charge Power Adapter</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-may-support-25w-fast-charge-power-adapter.2305191/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KgaAjDt5jdI:CLg9ocVO4ss:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KgaAjDt5jdI:CLg9ocVO4ss:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/KgaAjDt5jdI\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"af76804beb7b0307896f18f8075993436d9eb35ed95d9990c8580ce823b13e4d","category":"Apple"}
