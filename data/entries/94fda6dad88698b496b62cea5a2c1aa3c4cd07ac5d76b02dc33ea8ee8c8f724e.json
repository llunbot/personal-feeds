Edits is available for <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/edits-an-instagram-app/id6738967378\">preorder on the iOS App\nStore</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t use CapCut (and can’t download it now), so I can’t judge whether the screenshots of Edits indicate that it’s a copycat of CapCut (say that five times fast), which would be pretty funny coming so closely on the heels of <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/10/mark-zuckerberg-joe-rogan-apple-innovation/\">Zuckerberg’s claim on Joe Rogan’s show</a> that Apple hasn’t invented anything new since the iPhone, or if it’s just a different take on a video editing app for phones. Adobe InDesign was absolutely designed to make QuarkXPress users feel at home, but it wasn’t a rip-off or clone. It was (and remains) an Adobe take on Quark-style page layout. I’m curious what those familiar with CapCut think.</p>\n\n<p>Glad to see The Verge warming up to calling blatant clones “blatant clones”, though, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-ripoff\">rather than</a> “not exactly hiding where it got its inspiration from” and “that’s not necessarily a bad thing!”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/meta-edits-verge\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"94fda6dad88698b496b62cea5a2c1aa3c4cd07ac5d76b02dc33ea8ee8c8f724e","category":"Tech"}
