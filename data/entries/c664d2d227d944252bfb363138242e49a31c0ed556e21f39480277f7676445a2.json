It had everything it needed to prompt a revolution, including controllers far more sophisticated than the competition and the ability to render polygons a decade before gaming's 3D revolution.</p>\n<p>It was years ahead of anything else on the market, yet it could not have launched at a worse time. The Vectrex hit stores at the tail end of 1982. Over the next six months, the then-booming video game market went bust. The Vectrex, a potential revolution in home gaming, was swept into bargain bins, forgotten by all but the most ardent of collectors.</p>\n<p>Forty years later, it's having something of a comeback. New developers are breathing fresh code into this aged machine, hardware hackers and tinkerers are ensuring that tired capacitors and CRTs stay functional, and a new game has seen retail release after sitting unplayed for four decades.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992315#p3\">Read 58 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992315&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c664d2d227d944252bfb363138242e49a31c0ed556e21f39480277f7676445a2","category":"Tech"}
