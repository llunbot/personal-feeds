{"title":"SUMMER SALE: Ride1Up ebikes slashes prices on most popular models","link":"https://bikerumor.com/summer-sale-ride1up-ebikes-slashes-prices-on-most-popular-models/","date":1722024894000,"content":"<p>When San Diego-based Ride1Up began developing bikes in 2018, the brand had a laser focus on pulling prices down so riders spanning a wide variety of skills, disciplines, and financial wiggle room could experience high quality e-bikes that had traditionally been priced too high to afford.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six years later, <a href=\"https://ride1up.com\">Ride1Up has established itself</a> with 12 unique bikes including folders, cruisers, commuters, mopeds, fat-tire bikes, and performance-focused models all selling for affordable MSRPs ranging from $995 to $2,500.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ride1Up says it knows that their bikes are not the cheapest on the market, nor are they the most expensive. What it does promise is that it has taken every step to maximize each dollar that goes into its bikes, and wastes nothing on components that won’t drastically improve the rider’s experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paired with a primarily direct-to-consumer business model and reliable, U.S.-based customer support, Ride1Up stands out as an attractive choice for riders looking to break into the ebike market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a limited time through the summer, Ride1Up has slashed prices on some of their most popular models, offering hundreds in savings and even spare batteries with purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ride1up Cafe Cruiser</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ride1Up’s Cafe Cruiser combines vintage beach-cruiser styling and integrated features that maximize comfort and versatility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://ride1up.com/product/cruiser/\">Cafe Cruiser’s swept-back handlebars</a> put riders in a comfortable upright position, while integrated fenders and a welded-on cargo rack add leaps and bounds to the bike’s ability to perform on short stints or longer hauls with cargo ranging from groceries to passengers weighing up to 150 lbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Class 3 ebike, the Cafe Cruiser maxes out at 28mph with pedal assistance and about 20mph with the throttle. Its 750w sustained gear hub motor packs 60nm torque and has a range of 30 to 50 miles depending on the rider, terrain, and level of assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cafe Cruiser comes in step-over or step-through models and is an ideal bike for the casual rider who prioritizes comfort and versatility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shimano Acera eight-speed drivetrain</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Zoom 180mm hydraulic brakes with electric cut-off sensor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mozo hydraulic lockout fork with 80mm travel</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kd21C Adjustable Speed Display.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Integrated head and tail lights</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3-inch tires</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key feature of the Cafe Cruiser is its current-based cadence sensor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eddie Cervantes, Ride1Up’s director of marketing, said many cadence sensors are speed-based, meaning that as soon as someone begins pedaling, the motor will drive the bike up to its top speed as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our system measures the current that you are pushing on the pedals, so it provides a more natural riding experience,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BikeRumor’s Tyler Benedict spoke with Ride1UP’s founder Kevin Dugger in February to tackle <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ride1up-e-bike-founder-podcast-interview/\">current-based cadence sensors in the BikeRumor podcast</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said the conversation changed his mind about good cadence sensors and rear-hub motors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cafe Cruiser comes in Gray, Indigo, or White for an MSRP of $1,395. During the summer sale, Ride1up has knocked $300 off select styles, bringing the total to as low as $1,095.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ride1up Prodigy v2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Cafe Cruiser sits firmly in the cruiser category, the Ride1Up Prodigy V2 provides a more versatile platform for riders who enjoy dabbling in adventure as much as commuting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the Cafe Cruiser offers a more chill vibe, <a href=\"https://ride1up.com/product/prodigy-v2/\">the Ride1Up Prodigy V2 brings a more rowdy personality</a> with more power, range, and capability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, the Prodigy V2 looks like a hardtail mountain bike that has been decked out for commuting. The bike features a German-engineered Brose mid-drive motor with 90nm torque and a 36v14ah Phylion BN21 battery with a range of 30 to 50 miles, depending on factors like terrain and level of pedal assistance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Class 3 ebike, the Prodigy V2 also maxes out at 28 mph under pedal assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prodigy V2 comes equipped with a 100mm air suspension fork to calm down chattery roads, gravel, or light off-road routes, along with front and rear fenders to protect riders from water and road debris, along with a comfortable Selle Royal Vienton saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike also includes rear a cargo rack that can carry up to 40 lbs of gear, and includes an integrated tail light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prodigy V2 rolls on Maxxis Rekon Race Tires, which are right at home on dirt trails and will provide more than enough grip on pavement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>XC-275 36v 80 lux front light</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chain-driven or belt-driven build options</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brose Integrate torque sensor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brose Display Allround 1.5-inch color display</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ride1Up Prodigy V2 comes in step-through or step-over builds in three colors: Onyx Black, Faded Bronze, and Sea Fog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike usually sells for an MSRP of $2,395. It is currently on sale of $2,295.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Ride1up offers a variety of accessory packages that include features like a front rack, rear basket, or panniers to give the bike more capacity for cargo or touring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ride1up Prodigy XC</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ride1up.com/product/prodigy/\" target=\"_blank\">Ride1Up’s Prodigy XC</a> takes a hard left turn into full-on mountain biking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prodigy XC features a Brose TF Sprinter mid-drive motor with 90nm torque and a range of 30-50 miles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mid-drive Brose motor is extremely intuitive and smooth in its power delivery. It is quiet and offers highly responsive power output through a torque sensor and responds to pedal inputs from the rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prodigy XC features a more stripped-down design than the Cafe Cruiser or Rift, which is ideal for its intended use as an off-road, or XC-style mountain bike that thrives on trails and twisty single track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Class 3 ebike, the Prodigy XC still boasts a top speed of 28mph. It comes equipped with a handlebar-mounted 1.5-inch LCD display and an integrated headlight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Maxxis Forecaster 27.5×2.4 inch tires</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tektro Orion HD-M750 four-piston brakes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>42t narrow-wide alloy chainring</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shimano Alivio 11-34t cassette</li>\n\n\n\n<li>microShift Advent RD-M619 derailleur</li>\n\n\n\n<li>120mm air fork with hydraulic lockout</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prodigy XC ranks among Ride1Up’s higher-end models designed for a particular style of riding. It usually sells for an MSRP of $2,195, but currently goes for $1,795.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story is sponsored by <a href=\"https://ride1up.com/product/prodigy/\" target=\"_blank\">Ride1Up</a>.
