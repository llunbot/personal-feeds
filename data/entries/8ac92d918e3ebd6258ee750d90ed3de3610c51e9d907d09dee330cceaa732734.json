(credit: Lotus)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Earlier today, Lotus Cars revealed its idea of an \"intelligent performance vehicle.\" The wedge-shaped concept, called Theory 1, is meant to be Lotus' new design manifesto for all its future cars and combines some eye-popping technical specs along with an adaptive driving experience that uses haptics and binaural sound to enhance driver feedback.</p>\n<p>\"With Theory 1, we’ve built on everything Lotus has achieved so far in its 76-year history, to push the boundaries for what it means to drive a performance vehicle. We want to demonstrate that you don’t need to compromise—with both digital and analog capabilities working harmoniously in the future car. In doing this, we are able to bring drivers the best possible immersive driving experience with raw emotion, functionality and connectivity, at the core,\" said Ben Payne, vice president of design at Lotus Group.</p>\n<p>In profile, the Theory 1 has more than a little resemblance to the Lamborghini Huracan, although that impression starts to fade as you see the car from other angles. The doors are something entirely new. Forget butterflies, dihedrals, or even gull wings; here, they open in reverse, allowing the occupants to step right into the car. The new design also allows the doors to open even in the tightest of parking spaces.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050488#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050488&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
