{"title":"The Exception That Proves the Rule: HP Sold PCs With iTunes Pre-Installed in 2004","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2004/01/08HP-and-Apple-Partner-to-Deliver-Digital-Music-Player-and-iTunes-to-HP-Customers/","date":1711234998000,"content":"\n<p>Apple press release from January 2004:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Working to provide consumers with the most compelling digital \ncontent whenever and wherever they desire, HP and Apple today \nannounced a strategic alliance to deliver an HP-branded digital \nmusic player based on Apple’s iPod, the number one digital music \nplayer in the world, and Apple’s award-winning iTunes digital \nmusic jukebox and pioneering online music store to HP’s customers. </p>\n\n<p>As part of the alliance, HP consumer PCs and notebooks will come \npreinstalled with Apple’s iTunes jukebox software and an \neasy-reference desktop icon to point consumers directly to the \niTunes Music Store, ensuring a simple, seamless music experience. \nThis offering is yet another way that HP is helping consumers \nenjoy more from their personal digital entertainment content. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/21/snell-us-vs-apple\">My point stands</a> that iTunes on Windows was successful largely from users who installed it themselves, but it’s a worth a correction to point out that it <em>was</em> pre-installed on HP PCs for a while, and at the time HP was the second-biggest PC maker. Hard to believe I forgot this, because the most remarkable part of the deal wasn’t that HP pre-installed iTunes, but that Apple granted HP a license to sell HP-branded iPods.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/23/hp-itunes\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"77b75fb30ac9286a7af57fa54d44d96f6f886b2a6bb2c3ed21c585f13d555370","category":"Tech"}
