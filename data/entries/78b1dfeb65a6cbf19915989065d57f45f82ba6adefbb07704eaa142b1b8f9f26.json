{"title":"Democracy","link":"https://protectdemocracy.org/","date":1743972584000,"content":"\n<p>My sincere thanks to The Ole Independence Hall Hooligans for sponsoring this past week at DF to promote democracy. That’s it. A real sponsorship, real money, raised by a group of readers who simply wanted the ad space on DF to promote, as they described it, “the enduring and aspirational project that is democracy.”</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/03/democracy\">their sponsored RSS entry</a> to start the week, they quoted <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript\">the preamble to the US Constitution</a>. I’ll go a decade earlier, and quote from <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript\">the Declaration of Independence</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of\nrepeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the\nestablishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove\nthis, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>\n\n<p>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and\nnecessary for the public good. [...]</p>\n\n<p>He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of\ntheir offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. [...]</p>\n\n<p>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</p>\n\n<p>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:</p>\n\n<p>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:</p>\n\n<p>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended\noffences:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/trump-claims-to-extend-tiktok-deadline-for-another-75-days\">Sounds</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/glasser-trump-ego\">like</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/05/us/trump-news-tariffs#justice-dept-immigration-lawyer-leave\">someone</a> in the news today (and yesterday, and alas, surely again tomorrow). There is no greater threat to democracy itself than a delusional mad king, whether he wears a crown or a ridiculous ugly red cap. Take action and make your voice heard now — democracy in action is democracy’s only defense.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/06/democracy\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"78b1dfeb65a6cbf19915989065d57f45f82ba6adefbb07704eaa142b1b8f9f26","category":"Tech"}
