It’s available in beta form to Rouvy subscribers who have signed up to its waiting list, with a gradual rollout to manage demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rouvy Route Creator allows you to upload a video of a route and ride it on the Rouvy platform. You can add augmented reality features, adding to the 25,000km of real road video over 1,500 routes already available in the app and recorded by Rouvy’s own teams.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Add augmented reality features to your own footage</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/ROUVY-Route-creator-setting-a-visibility-of-AR-objects-970x575.jpeg\" alt=\"Rouvy Route Creator\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/ROUVY-Route-creator-setting-a-visibility-of-AR-objects-970x575.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/ROUVY-Route-creator-setting-a-visibility-of-AR-objects-300x178.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/ROUVY-Route-creator-setting-a-visibility-of-AR-objects-768x455.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/ROUVY-Route-creator-setting-a-visibility-of-AR-objects-750x444.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/ROUVY-Route-creator-setting-a-visibility-of-AR-objects-1140x675.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/ROUVY-Route-creator-setting-a-visibility-of-AR-objects.jpeg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Rouvy</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/rouvy-review\" target=\"_blank\">Rouvy</a> already supports video uploads, until now you’ve only been able to ride it in first-person view. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Rouvy Route Creator functionality allows you to ride video routes with others, interact with them and add your own customisation by dropping other objects on the route video. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The functionality relies on the use of GPS-enabled video. At the moment, Rouvy only supports the latest GoPro cameras, but it’s expanding support to other action cams. There are stipulations on camera height, speed, distances and other parameters for the recording, which need to be met for the AR functionality to work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also note that not all GoPros have a GPS chip, with that functionality left out on the Hero12 Black to improve battery life. That’s despite incorporating GPS at launch in almost all its top top spec models since 2016 (and including it in the latest Hero13 Black model). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once uploaded, you can edit the footage in the Rouvy Route Creator app to remove stops or interruptions such as halts at junctions. Rouvy uses a traffic light system to flag if the footage is ready for its augmented reality processing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once ready, Rouvy processes the footage to create a 3D world, where other riders’ avatars behave as they would in the real world, disappearing when they pass around bends or buildings, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/ROUVY-Route-creator-setting-a-lane-width-970x575.jpeg\" alt=\"Rouvy Route Creator\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/ROUVY-Route-creator-setting-a-lane-width-970x575.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/ROUVY-Route-creator-setting-a-lane-width-300x178.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/ROUVY-Route-creator-setting-a-lane-width-768x455.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/ROUVY-Route-creator-setting-a-lane-width-750x444.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/ROUVY-Route-creator-setting-a-lane-width-1140x675.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/ROUVY-Route-creator-setting-a-lane-width.jpeg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Rouvy</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rouvy allows you to set a lane limit, so that avatars don’t ride through oncoming vehicles. You can also drop start and finish gates, route segments, other riders, spectators or other objects, including sound effects, onto the route. Rouvy mimics the real-world route gradients too, based on the imported GPS file and Google data, so you can suffer on the climbs on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/the-best-turbo-trainers-a-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">turbo</a>, just like in the real world. Alternatively, you can edit the route gradient, making it steeper or easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve finished, the route will be saved on Rouvy’s servers and can be made public or private, so you don’t have to store gigabytes of data on your own device. It’s a nice addition to what was already one of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-cycling-training-apps\" target=\"_blank\">best indoor training apps</a>, providing a richer experience when re-riding your favourite routes and allowing you to share them with others. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/rouvy-review\">Rouvy review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/insta360-go-2-action-camera-review\">Insta360 Go 2 action camera review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-cycling-training-apps\">Best cycling indoor training apps to make you a better cyclist in 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/action-camera-round-up\">Best cycling action cameras: capture your cycling adventures</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/the-best-turbo-trainers-a-buyers-guide\">Best smart turbo trainers: Top Zwift compatible indoor trainers</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/rouvy-route-creator\">Now you can make your own AR routes on Rouvy with its Route Creator</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f461ce2aca45336d7b02ef12654fdb7898ad5eacf9c2029c206de6b6e7558388","category":"Cycling"}
