Below, we recap new features and changes rumored for iOS 18, which is projected to be the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/ios-18-big-expectations/\">\"biggest\" update in the iPhone's history</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-18-WWDC-24-Feature-2.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\niOS 18 is rumored to include new AI features for Siri and many apps, and Apple plans to add RCS support to the Messages app for an improved texting experience between iPhones and Android devices. The update is also expected to introduce a more customizable Home Screen and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/\">other user interface design changes</a>, new features in apps like Apple Maps and Calculator, additional accessibility features, and much more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWWDC 2024 will begin with Apple's keynote <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/\">on June 10 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time</a>, and the iOS 18 beta should be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately following the presentation. A public beta is typically released in July, and the update should be widely released to all users in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor additional information, read our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18 roundup</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Smarter Siri and Generative AI</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\niOS 18 is rumored to have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/\">new AI features</a> for Siri, Spotlight, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more, according to sources such as <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly teased that the company is working on generative AI, and plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/\">share details \"later this year,\"</a> and Apple's marketing chief Greg Joswiak also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-ios-18-ai-wwdc-2024/\">hinted at AI</a> in a social media post about WWDC 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGenerative AI surged in popularity in late 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other text prompts. The company has also expanded into generative AI tools for images and videos. Other companies like Google and Microsoft have also pushed into the generative AI space, and the technology is quickly evolving.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18 is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/ios-18-reportedly-wont-have-apple-chatbot/\">not expected to include an Apple-designed chatbot</a>, but a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-finalizing-deal-openai-chatgpt-ios-18/\">partnership with OpenAI</a> will reportedly be announced at WWDC.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>More Customizable Home Screen</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-Home-Screen-Gradient-Blank-Spaces-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\niOS 18 will feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-more-customizable-home-screen-rumor/\">\"more customizable\" Home Screen</a>, according to Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>MacRumors</em> exclusively reported that iOS 18 will finally allow users to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-home-screen-app-icon-customization/\">place app icons anywhere on the Home Screen grid</a>. This means that users will be able to create blank spaces, columns, and rows between app icons. This basic feature has long been available on Android smartphones, and now Apple is bringing it to the iPhone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone users can already customize the Home Screen with apps such as Shortcuts and Widgetsmith, which can be used to create \"blank\" app icons and widgets, but Apple's official solution will be much more convenient.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt was also reported that iOS 18 will allow users to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/ios-18-to-allow-users-to-recolor-app-icons/\">change the color of app icons</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>New Accessibility Features</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-18-Hover-Typing-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nEarlier this month, Apple previewed many new accessibility features coming later this year with software updates like iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, and visionOS 2. The announcement came one day ahead of Global Accessibility Awareness Day.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome of the new features coming to the iPhone <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-18-accessibility-features/\">include Eye Tracking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/apple-reduce-motion-sickness-feature/\">Vehicle Motion Cues</a>, Music Haptics, and Vocal Shortcuts. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-18-accessibility-features-for-carplay/\">CarPlay will also be getting more accessibility features</a> with iOS 18, including Sound Recognition, which will allow drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing to turn on alerts to be notified of car horns and sirens.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>New Apple Maps Features</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/apple-maps-3d-feature.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"896\" />\r<br />\n<em>MacRumors</em> previously revealed two potential new Apple Maps features coming with iOS 18: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-maps-custom-routes-ios-18/\">custom routes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/ios-18-topographic-maps/\">topographic maps</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the custom routes feature, Apple Maps users would be able to choose specific roads to travel on while navigating, for reasons such as familiarity or scenic views. This feature is expected to be available in the U.S. only at launch. Google Maps already allows users to create custom routes on the web, and then view them on an iPhone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTopographic maps first debuted on the Apple Watch last year with watchOS 10, and code suggests that the feature will be expanded to the iPhone, Mac, and Vision Pro with iOS 18, macOS 15, and visionOS 2. These maps include details such as trails, contour lines, elevation, and points of interest for hiking and other outdoor uses.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>RCS Support in Messages App</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1407\" />\r<br />\nIn November, Apple announced that it would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/\">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting \"later\" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul>\r<br />\n <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li>\r<br />\n <li>Audio messages</li>\r<br />\n <li>Typing indicators</li>\r<br />\n <li>Read receipts</li>\r<br />\n <li>Wi-Fi messaging</li>\r<br />\n <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li>\r<br />\n</ul>These features are already available for iMessage and in many third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>More Rumors Per App</h2>\r<br />\n<ul><li><strong>Apple Music:</strong> With iOS 18, Apple Music will reportedly be able to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/\">auto-generate playlists</a>, and there is also a rumor about <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/ios-18-apple-music-song-transitions/\">smarter song transitions</a>.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Calculator:</strong> iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15 are rumored to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/19/macos-15-revamped-calculator-app/\">revamped Calculator app with several new features</a>, including a sidebar that lists recent calculations, an improved interface for converting units, integration with the Notes app, and more.

The app is also rumored to gain a built-in audio recording tool, eliminating the need to switch over to the Voice Memos app. In addition, both Notes and Voice Memos could gain the ability to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/ios-18-audio-transcriptions-rumor/\">transcribe audio</a>.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Safari:</strong> iOS 18 is likely to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/ios-18-safari-browsing-assistant-rumor/\">add a browsing assistant to Safari</a>, which could <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/safari-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/\">summarize web pages and more</a>.
