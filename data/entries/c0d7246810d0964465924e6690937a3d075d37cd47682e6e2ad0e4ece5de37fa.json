The update is expected to borrow heavily from the design language of visionOS with 3D translucent materials and rounded window elements. The design changes are said to be among the most significant visual updates to macOS in years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is rumored to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/\">shifting the naming system</a> used by its software platforms toward consistent year-adjacent numerical titles. As a result, we are expecting the next major version of macOS to be \"macOS 26\" rather than \"macOS 16.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nmacOS 26 will be officially introduced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which starts on June 9, with the first developer beta expected to be released immediately following the keynote address. Public beta testing typically follows in July, with a full public release in the fall. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/macos-26-rumored-to-drop-support-for-these-macs/\">macOS 26 Rumored to Drop Support for These Four Macs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-26-rumored-to-drop-support-for-these-four-macs.2457866/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c0d7246810d0964465924e6690937a3d075d37cd47682e6e2ad0e4ece5de37fa","category":"Apple"}
