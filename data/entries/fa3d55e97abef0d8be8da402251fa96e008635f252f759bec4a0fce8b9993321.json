In a letter dated August 22, Apple showed its support for California's right-to-repair bill, <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB244\">SB 244</a>, after spending years combatting DIY repair efforts.</p>\n<p>As reported by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/apple-lends-support-to-california-state-right-to-repair-bill/\">TechCrunch</a>, the letter, written to California state Senator Susan Eggman, declared that Apple supports SB 244 and urged the legislature to pass it.</p>\n<p>The bill requires vendors of consumer electronics and appliances to make sufficient documentation, parts, and tools for repairs available to customers and independent repair shops. The big exceptions are video game consoles and alarm systems.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962860#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962860&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fa3d55e97abef0d8be8da402251fa96e008635f252f759bec4a0fce8b9993321","category":"Tech"}
