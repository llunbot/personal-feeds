Enter the Assos Dyora RS Spring Fall Jacket, a combination of a long sleeve thermal jersey and a softshell made for high intensity cycling during the cooler months.</p>\n<p>The Assos Dyora RS Spring Fall Jacket boasts a balance of insulation and moisture control whilst also being less than bulky thanks to its close-to-the-body, compressive fit.</p>\n<p>I wore a size L on its own and it felt like a second skin, but you could add a thermal underneath, or the Dyora RS Spring Fall Aero Gilet over the top, depending on the weather.</p>\n<p>It’s true to size with a racer’s aerodynamic cut, a high front, and a long tail which provides full rear coverage, and I didn’t experience any noise or flapping from loose material.</p>\n<p>What I particularly liked was the swathe of purple which lines the three rear pockets and the subtle geometric design which drops down either side of the shoulder blades.</p>\n<p>Add in reflective taping on the front of the shoulders and micro-perforated bonded tape at the back for added visibility, I felt safe and secure in a racing position whilst battling the biting evening wind.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/10/assoss_spring_fall_dyora_jacket_4_0.jpeg?itok=Ox7-DJho\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wiggle.co.uk/assos-dyora-rs-springfall-cycling-jacket\">Buy the Assos Dyora RS Spring Fall Jacket on Wiggle</a></p>\n<h3>Assos Dyora RS Spring Fall Jacket comfort</h3>\n<p>The jersey and softshell combination ensures functional, aerodynamic racing but also doesn’t scrimp on comfort.</p>\n<p>The sleeves deserve a shout out. Made from Assos Sonic fabric, they mould to the arms and are ribbed which improves aerodynamics and also gives a flattering, comfortable fit.</p>\n<p>The jacket has a bobbled inner core shell with a full-length double slider zipper which keeps the core warm and the raw cut hems with silicon strips and dots keep the elements out.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/10/assoss_spring_fall_dyora_jacket_2_0.jpeg?itok=r5e-CjLs\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Assos Dyora RS Spring Fall Jacket breathability</h3>\n<p>Breathability is a key feature of this Assos jacket. The twinDeck construction offers a combination of insulation and breathability and the Diffusor shoulder vents draw in cooling air, preventing overheating and regulating body temperature.</p>\n<p>For someone whose body temperature fluctuates massively, this jacket is a blessing and allows you to fully focus on your cycling.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10117/rgt-cycling-flanders\">Ride like a world champ on RGT sim's new Flanders course</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/7897/indoor-training-platform-rgt-goes-completely-free-in-response-to-coronavirus\">Indoor training platform RGT goes completely free in response to coronavirus</a></div>    </div></div><h3>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/10/assoss_spring_fall_dyora_jacket_1_0.jpeg?itok=SlGim2Kt\" />  </div>\n</div>\n</h3>\n<h3>Assos Dyora RS Spring Fall Jacket bottom line</h3>\n<p>Assos has produced a slick transitional jacket for cycling into the cooler months and one which doesn’t skimp on performance. It is effortlessly comfortable, keeps off the chill whilst also being expertly breathable.</p>\n<p>At £265 the Assos Dyora RS Spring Fall Jacket sits in the upper end of the market.</p>\n<p>It is more costly than a Pactimo softshell and a Castelli or Gore long sleeve jacket so for something which you might only wear a few months of the year the price may seem unreasonable.</p>\n<p>That said, the Assos Dyora RS Spring Fall Jacket will be a cycling wardrobe staple that you will want to wear endlessly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wiggle.co.uk/assos-dyora-rs-springfall-cycling-jacket\">Buy the Assos Dyora RS spring fall jacket on Wiggle</a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/reviews/10175/assos-dyora-rs-spring-fall-jacket-images\">Assos Dyora RS spring fall jacket images </a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/reviews\">Reviews</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/emma-cole\">Emma Cole</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>7 Oct 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F10175%2Fassos-dyora-rs-spring-fall-jacket-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Assos%20Dyora%20RS%20spring%20fall%20jacket%20images%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F10175%2Fassos-dyora-rs-spring-fall-jacket-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Assos%20Dyora%20RS%20spring%20fall%20jacket%20images%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F10175%2Fassos-dyora-rs-spring-fall-jacket-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Assos%20Dyora%20RS%20spring%20fall%20jacket%20images%20&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F10175%2Fassos-dyora-rs-spring-fall-jacket-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/10175/assos-dyora-rs-spring-fall-jacket-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 4</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/10/assoss_spring_fall_dyora_jacket_5.jpeg?itok=bTs-iQI5\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/clothing\">Clothing</a></div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/jackets\">Jackets</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"ecole","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"320583e5e427a7059ae7de05aab61c426766853b34b54e96e4984516ec94a1a7","category":"Cycling"}
