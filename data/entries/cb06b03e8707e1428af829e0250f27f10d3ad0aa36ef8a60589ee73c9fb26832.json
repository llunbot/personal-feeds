The new 11th-generation iPad (also known as the \"iPad (A16)\" or just plain-old \"iPad\") looks identical to the previous version, it was introduced in a single paragraph buried in the middle of an iPad Air announcement, and the company didn't offer to send any to reviewers. The one I have I bought myself for our 5-year-old, whose hand-me-down <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/ipad-air-and-ipad-mini-2019-review-apples-tablets-strike-an-ideal-balance/\">2019 iPad Air 3</a> is slightly older than he is and a little worse for wear.</p>\n<p>There's nothing exciting or even particularly interesting about this tablet. The design is recycled from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/2022-ipad-review-a-half-step-forward-for-apples-basic-tablet/\">2022's 10th-generation iPad</a>, which was itself a lower-rent version of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/ipad-air-2020-review-semi-pro/\">2020 iPad Air design</a>. It's powered by a variant of the Apple A16, originally an iPhone chip from 2022. It still doesn't support the regular Apple Pencil or Pencil Pro or the same keyboard accessories as other iPads. It still doesn't have an anti-reflective screen coating, and the screen doesn't feel as nice to use as an iPad Air's or Pro's.</p>\n<p>But for all that, this is still probably the purest expression of what the iPad is: a cheap Internet-connected screen for reading and watching things. I say this as someone who has tried every new piece of hardware and software that Apple has introduced to try and make the iPad a powerful and versatile laptop replacement—it still feels like trying to make a square peg fit into a round hole. The more expensive iPads are <em>nice</em>, but I don't end up using them much differently from how I use this bare-bones tablet.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apples-349-ipad-11-is-missing-a-lot-but-its-still-all-the-ipad-most-people-need/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apples-349-ipad-11-is-missing-a-lot-but-its-still-all-the-ipad-most-people-need/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb06b03e8707e1428af829e0250f27f10d3ad0aa36ef8a60589ee73c9fb26832","category":"Tech"}
