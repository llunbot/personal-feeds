Remember when he beat the peloton to Paris by more than five days – despite riding further, climbing more, resting less, and sleeping in a tent?</p><p>Wasn’t that a hell of a thing?</p><p>Well, now you can win the bike that carried Lachlan Morton – bikepacking bags, hacked-up Birkenstocks and all – around an entire country.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/85A_5942-1340x1002.jpg\"><figcaption>“You and me, we’re going to see some things.”</figcaption></figure><p>Morton’s Alt Tour was always a ride with a higher purpose, raising funds for the bicycle charity World Bicycle Relief. Together with Rapha and EF Education First, who each donated 500 bikes for recipients in need in the developing world, more than £500,000<em> </em>(AU$925,000/US$680,000) was raised for the charity.</p><p>Morton’s bike – a team-issue Cannondale SuperSix EVO complete with a Shimano Dura Ace Di2 drivetrain and Vision wheels, in a 54 cm – is now being raffled off, with proceeds going to World Bicycle Relief. That’s the grand prize, but there are also four signed EF jerseys up for grabs.</p><p>If that sounds like the kind of thing you might be into, or if you just want to support a worthy cause, head to <a href=\"https://worldbicyclerelief.org/alt-tour/\">WorldBicycleRelief.org</a> for all the Ts and Cs and to buy a ticket. You can enter with a donation of £25, or for the cost of sending a postcard.</p></div></div>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"c6387de26cda8f0b3e50a399f21189f48cb944af353d86bada8885109b3ba578","category":"Cycling"}
