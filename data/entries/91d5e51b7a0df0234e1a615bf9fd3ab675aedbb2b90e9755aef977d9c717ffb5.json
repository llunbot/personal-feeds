Yesterday, Gurman revealed <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/apple-tests-2024-m3-max-macbook-pro-chip-with-16-cpu-cores-40-gpu-cores#xj4y7vzkg\">the specs of a new M3 Max</a>, which has a total of 16 CPU cores and 40 GPU cores, plus 48GB of memory (likely not the maximum that will be available since the current MacBook Pros can go up to 96GB).</p>\n<p>The current M2 Max, found in the 16-inch MacBook Pro and the Mac Studio, tops out at 12 CPU cores and 38 GPU cores. Gurman says that all four of the M3 Max's extra CPU cores should be large, high-performance cores rather than smaller efficiency cores; both kinds of cores boost speeds, but performance cores are obviously more useful for high-end workloads.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this week, Gurman also <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-08-06/apple-iphone-15-comes-amid-us-sales-slowdown-tim-cook-q3-earnings-comments-lkzfs14u\">noticed</a> a new base-model M3 chip that continued to use 8 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores, just like the current M2. This chip would still be a speed upgrade from the M2, but it would have to rely on architectural improvements and clock speed boosts rather than extra cores. The original M1 used eight CPU cores as well, also split evenly between high-performance and high-efficiency cores.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959534#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959534&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"91d5e51b7a0df0234e1a615bf9fd3ab675aedbb2b90e9755aef977d9c717ffb5","category":"Tech"}
