The feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/shareplay-music-control-homepod-apple-tv/\">first appeared</a> in the iOS 17.4 and tvOS 17.4 betas earlier this year, but it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/apple-removes-shareplay-apple-tv-homepod/\">was removed</a> before those updates were released.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/SharePlay-Music-Control-Expanding-Feature-2.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThis feature allows others to control Apple Music playback on your HomePod or Apple TV with permission, regardless of whether they subscribe to the service. The primary user can decide whether to approve or deny each request.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple already rolled out a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/13/whats-new-carplay-ios-17/\">similar feature for CarPlay</a> last year, allowing anyone in a car to control music playback via SharePlay with permission.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>HomePod</h2>\r<br />\nWhile playing a song in the Music app on your iPhone, tap the SharePlay icon at the bottom of the screen to bring up a QR code, which another person can scan with their iPhone or Android smartphone's camera to request access to music playback controls. Even a screenshot of the QR code suffices for remote access.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature works on both the HomePod and HomePod mini, and we could imagine the QR code eventually being shown on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/homepod-with-screen-delayed-next-year/\">long-rumored HomePod with a screen</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple TV</h2>\r<br />\nWith the tvOS 18 update, the Music app on the Apple TV can also show a QR code on the TV that guests can scan to request access to music controls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe expansion of this feature to the Apple TV and the HomePod is useful for house parties, allowing everyone to be the DJ.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18, tvOS 18, and HomePod software version 18 are currently in beta, and the updates will be widely released later this year.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shareplay/\">SharePlay</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/ios-18-tvos-18-shareplay-homepod-apple-tv/\">iOS 18 and tvOS 18 Reintroduce SharePlay for Apple Music on HomePods and Apple TV</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-and-tvos-18-reintroduce-shareplay-for-apple-music-on-homepods-and-apple-tv.2429222/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"70d7d417bc0abb3e22756817547512c60b4c2b56eb00a58d499e2060257ec9ba","category":"Apple"}
