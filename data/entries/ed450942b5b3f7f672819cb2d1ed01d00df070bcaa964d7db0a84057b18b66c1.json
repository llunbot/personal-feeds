The <a href=\"https://fave.co/3F4EnZt\" target=\"_blank\">Heybike Tyson</a> is loaded with all of the e-bike features I could ever want, is a blast to ride, and can become unsafe to operate at a moment's notice. The unit I reviewed had more than one build-quality issue that cannot be overlooked, which is a shame, because this is also one of the most fun electric bikes I've ever ridden. If you just wanted to know if the Heybike Tyson is worth buying, you've got your answer and can close this tab. If you want the details, read on.</p>\n<p>Priced at $1,699, the Class 3 Tyson is Heybike's folding e-bike. Built with a magnesium frame and painted bright green, the Tyson's scooter-like handlebars, mountain-bike-like suspension, and fat knobby tires result in a ride that looks equal parts goofy, charming, and rugged. Capable of carrying up to 400 lbs (163 kg) of rider and cargo, the Tyson sports a dual hydraulic suspension to smooth out the rough spots on the pavement. It has the same Shimano seven-speed groupset and hydraulic disc brakes you'll see on most e-bikes.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tyson-folded.jpg\"><img alt=\"The Heybike Tyson is indeed foldable, and the battery is removable.

It has a headlight, taillight, turn signals, and even a horn that does a passable imitation of the Roadrunner right before he's about to clown the coyote. It's powered by a 750 W motor and a 48V 15 Ah battery that can charge fully in four to five hours. Unfortunately, you'll never quite know how much battery life you actually have once you start ridingâ€”more on that, later.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973956#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973956&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Bangeman","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ed450942b5b3f7f672819cb2d1ed01d00df070bcaa964d7db0a84057b18b66c1","category":"Tech"}
