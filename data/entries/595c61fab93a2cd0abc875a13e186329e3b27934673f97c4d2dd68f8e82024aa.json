But this Court has many times held, in many contexts, that it is no job for government to decide what counts as the right balance of private expressionâ€”to 'un-bias' what it thinks biased, rather than to leave such judgments to speakers and their audiences. That principle works for social-media platforms as it does for others.\"</p>\n<p>A Big Tech lobby group that challenged the state laws said it was pleased by the ruling. \"In a complex series of opinions that were unanimous in the outcome, but divided 6-3 in their reasoning, the Court sent the cases back to lower courts, making clear that a State may not interfere with private actors' speech,\" the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association <a href=\"https://ccianet.org/news/2024/07/supreme-court-issues-ruling-in-ccia-netchoice-challenge-to-florida-texas-social-media-laws/\">said</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034680#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034680&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"595c61fab93a2cd0abc875a13e186329e3b27934673f97c4d2dd68f8e82024aa","category":"Tech"}
