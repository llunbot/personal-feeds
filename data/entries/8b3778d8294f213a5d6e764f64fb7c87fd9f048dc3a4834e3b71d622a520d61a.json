Just like the new iMac today, press releases and YouTube videos for the new MacBook Pro and Mac mini models are likely on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBelow, we reiterate what to expect from the new MacBook Pro and Mac mini models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacBook Pro</h3>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg\" width=\"1440\" height=\"810\" />\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, including an entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip, and higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo major external design changes have been rumored for the laptops this year, with improvements such as an OLED display and thinner design not expected <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/macbook-pro-wont-switch-to-oled-in-2025-rumor/\">until 2026 at the earliest</a>. However, the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro is expected to gain an additional Thunderbolt port compared to the current model, based on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/apple-potentially-facing-worst-leak-since-iphone-4/\">alleged leaks earlier this month</a>. Those same leaks revealed that the MacBook Pro lineup might finally start with 16GB of RAM, instead of 8GB, which was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/\">rumored even before the leaks happened</a>. As another clue, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/new-m4-imac-minimum-16gb-ram/\">new iMac has a minimum of 16GB of RAM for all configurations</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple last redesigned the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro in 2021, and the latest models with the M3 family of chips were released last October.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Mac mini</h3>\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-Mac-mini-Ortho-Silver-Cooler.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /><em>A concept of a smaller Mac mini</em></div>\r<br />\nThe next Mac mini is expected to be available with M4 and M4 Pro chip options. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/mac-mini-redesign-rumor/\">expects the next Mac mini to be smaller</a>, making it closer in size to an Apple TV, and he said that the computer will gain two front-facing USB-C ports. All in all, the Mac mini is expected to receive its biggest redesign since 2010.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike the new iMac, the next Mac mini could also start with 16GB of RAM, instead of 8GB.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new MacBook Pro and Mac mini models will likely be available to pre-order starting this week, and they are expected to launch in November. The new iMac became available to pre-order today, and it launches on Friday, November 8.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-promises-two-more-mac-announcements/\">Apple Promises Two More Mac Announcements This Week Following New iMac Today</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-promises-two-more-mac-announcements-this-week-following-new-imac-today.2441166/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8b3778d8294f213a5d6e764f64fb7c87fd9f048dc3a4834e3b71d622a520d61a","category":"Apple"}
