The report comes as research and news stories have highlighted how misleading posts and outright disinformation can draw intense engagement on the company’s platforms.</p>\n<p>Much of the scrutiny has focused on far-right accounts, which according to Facebook’s own tool, CrowdTangle, receive the most engagement—likes, shares, and comments. For example, Kevin Roose, a reporter at The New York Times, uses CrowdTangle to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FacebooksTop10\">tweet out a list</a> of the “10 top-performing link posts by US Facebook pages every day, ranked by total interactions.” What his experiment has revealed is that, day after day, far-right accounts and pages from the likes of Ben Shapiro, Dan Bongino, and Newsmax appeared on the list, sometimes occupying multiple spots. Facebook's critics have pointed to the list as evidence that the platform has become a right-wing media machine.</p>\n<p>The Twitter account, Roose <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html\">said</a>, “drove executives crazy” at Facebook. They felt it was making Facebook look like it favored right-wing accounts. All of that brings us to today.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788178#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788178&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4f4a052f89a1f040f848227cdf2c5960b42d7e2aad13906b306fd9b07f6e1542","category":"Tech"}
