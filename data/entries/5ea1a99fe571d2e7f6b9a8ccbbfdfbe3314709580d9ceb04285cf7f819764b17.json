Acknowledging that the 2GB configuration of the Raspberry Pi 4 and the Raspberry Pi Zero had been particularly hard-hit by shortages, Upton announced that the price of the 2GB Pi 4 would increase from $35 to $45 and that a previously discontinued version of the Pi 4 with 1GB of RAM would be reintroduced at $35.</p>\n\n<p>The price increase for the 2GB Pi 4 and reintroduction of the 1GB model essentially reverts the Pi 4 lineup to where it was back <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-price-raspberry-pi-4-2gb/\">in February of 2020</a>, when the Pi Foundation cut the price of the 2GB Pi 4 from $45 to $35, a price cut that it said was \"permanent\" at the time. The March 2020 issue of the official Raspberry Pi Magazine (<a href=\"https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/issues/91/pdf/download\">PDF</a>) said that the 1GB model had been \"retired.\"</p>\n<p>Upton expressed hope that the price increase would be \"temporary\" and said that \"we see early signs that the supply chain situation is starting to ease.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805974#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805974&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5ea1a99fe571d2e7f6b9a8ccbbfdfbe3314709580d9ceb04285cf7f819764b17","category":"Tech"}
