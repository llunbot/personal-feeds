The new plan arrives after many existing Claude subscribers complained of hitting rate limits frequently.</p>\n<p>\"The top request from our most active users has been expanded Claude access,\" wrote Anthropic in a news release. A <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=reddit+claude+limits\">brief stroll through user feedback</a> on Reddit seems to confirm that sentiment, showing that many Claude users have been unhappy with Anthropic's usage limits over the past yearâ€”even on the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/the-ai-assistant-wars-heat-up-with-claude-pro-a-new-chatgpt-plus-rival/\">Claude Pro</a> plan, which costs $20 a month.</p>\n<p>One of the downsides of a relatively <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/anthropics-claude-ai-can-now-digest-an-entire-book-like-the-great-gatsby-in-seconds/\">large context window</a> with Claude (the amount of text it can process at once) has been that long conversations or inclusions of many reference documents (such as code files) fill up usage limits quickly. That's because each time the user adds to the conversation, the entire text of the conversation (including any attached documents) is fed back into the AI model again and re-evaluated. But on the other hand, a large context window allows Claude to process more complex projects within each session.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/anthropic-launches-200-claude-max-ai-plan-with-20x-higher-usage-limits/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/anthropic-launches-200-claude-max-ai-plan-with-20x-higher-usage-limits/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"de2ddffa841bae267d543585e7118a8c2775b7889a116cc057c3770a8fdfc470","category":"Tech"}
