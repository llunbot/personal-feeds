But that’s not the case! In fact, you can get an excellent deal right now–<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHDCN6P/\">Amazon is selling the 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro processor, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,199</a>. That’s a savings of $300 off the regular price and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But wait, it gets better. That $300 price cut applies if you decide to upgrade the RAM or the chip as well. For example, you can get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHTNHZJ/\">16-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro, 48GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD for $2,599</a> (regular price $2,899). Or you can get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHMYX53/\">16-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Max, 36GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $3,199</a> (regular price ($3,499).

The M4 Pro and Max laptops also have Thunderbolt 5, which offers a big speed boost with data transfers and enhanced external display support. The laptops also feature a new 12-megapixel Center Stage camera, a major upgrade from the 1080p camera in the M3-based MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One important note: The Amazon deal is for MacBook Pros with the standard display with glossy glass. Apple introduced a Nano-texture matter glass with the M4-series MacBook Pro, but Amazon doesn’t offer that option. The standard glass is the same glossy display Apple has offered for years, and it’s a great one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you need a new MacBook, go grab this fantastic deal for a fantastic laptop before the price goes back up.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f81b8422cb8a6cf664c271db6f676f2866aaa16f3872527d97d60226d6413b30","category":"Apple"}
