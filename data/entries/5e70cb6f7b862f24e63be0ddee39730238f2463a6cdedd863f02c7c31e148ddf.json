At that point U.S. users had to do without their TikTok fix for about 12 hours on January 19, but now another ban is looming, and this time it could mean that U.S. users have to go TikTok cold turkey… except there is a way to get around the TikTok ban, and we’ll show you how. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On April 5 2025 President Trump gave the Chinese owner of TikTok, ByteDance, another 75-days to decide if will sell to a U.S. owner. If the Chinese company doesn’t comply that could mean that there is no more TikTok for North Americans after June 19. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The multi-billion dollar question is whether TikTok users will be able to access the service if the ban comes into effect. Here’s what we know about the potential of using a VPN if TikTok is banned again.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to use a VPN to get around the TikTok ban</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not as simple as installing a VPN and then accessing TikTok. As we know from the brief January ban, while VPN services can get  around geoblocks, the app still wouldn’t run for U.S. users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As pointed out by users on social media at the time, TikTok accounts created in the United States were unable to access the platform, even when using a VPN. And for Apple users, many found it was actually tied to the region of their Apple ID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer was to install a version of TikTok from another country. Many North Americans in January chose to install the Canadian version of the app. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how an Apple user can get a compatible version of TikTok and run it in a VPN:  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choose one of the VPNs we recommend – we have reviewed loads of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231047/best-vpn-for-mac.html\">VPNs for Mac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668862/best-ipad-vpn.html\">iPad VPNs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668754/best-vpn-for-iphone.html\">iPhone VPNs</a>.
