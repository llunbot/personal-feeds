These special-edition bikes don’t just include the team’s 2023 kit colors. They also have a Cheetah print pattern on the fork, a reference to the famously speedy felines found throughout the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya’s Rift Valley Province. The valley’s vibrant landscape inspired the bike’s colorways and team colors for this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.teamamani.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Team Amani</a> will use the bikes in races in Africa, Europe, and North America “in an attempt to improve on their already impressive collection of victories and top placings from last year,” Factor Bikes said in a press release. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sule-inscription.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sule-inscription-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sule-inscription-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sule-inscription-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sule-inscription-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sule-inscription-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sule-inscription-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sule-inscription.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>A remembrance of Sule Kangangi: “Captain, Friend, Brother.”</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike also includes a small inscription honoring <a href=\"http://died at the Vermont Overland gravel race on Aug. 29\" target=\"_blank\">Sule Kangangi</a>, the Amani team leader who died at the Vermont Overland gravel race on Aug. 29 last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you dig the bike’s design, you can <a href=\"https://factorbikes.com/ostro-gravel-amani-edition/?utm_campaign=GravelSpring2023&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=249491132&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9YJvm5GbFcvucgIiCEPwI63PmpiWdOa_CVnnaeU8nWdyIqBb5W0qyxhvYJUmhPo9agT5oaLIsN9tJkHx2I7UvW7Tv4Og&amp;utm_content=249496947&amp;utm_source=hs_email\" target=\"_blank\">special order</a> one online.
