The roster includes former world champion Marta Bastianelli and recent Giro dell'Emilia winner Mavi Garcia. If the sale of the licence was to go through and be approved by the UCI, it is expected the team would be registed in the UAE.</p>\n<p>In a press release alongside the announcement, UAE Team Emirates team manager Mauro Gianetti said, 'We are pleased to announce that we are working to create a female team to compete on the world stage as part of the UAE's ambition to develop cycling, in support of a global project that started back in 2017.'</p>\n<p>'Together with the Alé BTC Ljubljana Team we have found the right opportunity and the availability we were looking for and, in collaboration with the UCI, we are preparing all the necessary documents for the completion of the acquisition of the World Tour licence starting from 1 January 2022.'</p>\n<p><em>We've contacted the UCI and UAE-Team Emirates for comment and are awaiting responses.</em> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"cb572be1a34bb812877e552504542c88f5d56273dcbf9a2bc780f213ced72496","category":"Cycling"}
