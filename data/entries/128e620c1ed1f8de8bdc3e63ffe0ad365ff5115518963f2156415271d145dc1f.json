These bikes are built for adventurous explorers, so QuietKat has decked them out with features and components that ensure off-road capability and durability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internally geared automatic transmissions, motorcycle chains, 1000w motors with up to 200nm of torque, 30Ah battery options, switchable Class 1, 2, or 3 settings, 118 accessory mounting points, and even a dropper post with seat suspension are all found on the Apex ebikes. And that’s just the highlights…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frame Features and Key Specs:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-side-field.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-side-field.jpg\" alt=\"QuietKat Apex HD, side, field\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-side-field.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-side-field-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-side-field-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-side-field-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-side-field-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-side-field-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apex ebikes are built around aluminum hardtail frames, and both models are available in Kick-through and Step-over options. The Kick-through style is roughly equivalent to a small-medium bike, and the Step-over (with the higher top tube) lines up with typical medium-large frames. The frame was redesigned for the Apex bikes to offer better accessibility and adaptability, and QuietKat says it’s their most rugged frame yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure a comfortable ride, the Apex ebikes get air-sprung 120mm KKE inverted suspension forks and dropper posts with integrated saddle suspension. Both models roll on 26×4.8” Kenda Juggernaut tires for comfort on rough terrain and solid traction. Four-piston hydraulic disc brakes provide plenty of stopping power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-ebikes-rear-rack.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"909\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-ebikes-rear-rack.jpg\" alt=\"QuietKat Apex ebikes, rear rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-ebikes-rear-rack.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-ebikes-rear-rack-297x225.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-ebikes-rear-rack-120x91.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-ebikes-rear-rack-768x582.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apex ebikes include QuietKat’s modular rear rack with class-leading load capacity (325 lbs). They can also host a new optional front rack and have a whopping 118 more mounting points to help haul your camping, fishing, or hunting gear (or tow a trailer). Rear fenders are included on both models. To further customize your adventure machine’s capabilities, QuietKat offers a whole line of racks, bags, and trailers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Automatic Transmissions:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-HD-hub-motor.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"792\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-HD-hub-motor.jpg\" alt=\"QuietKat Apex HD, hub motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-HD-hub-motor.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-HD-hub-motor-297x196.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-HD-hub-motor-120x79.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-HD-hub-motor-768x507.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One significant feature of the new Apex ebikes is their automatic transmissions. QuietKat says they’ve found that most issues with off-road ebikes are related to damaged derailleurs and broken chains. The Apex ebikes’ internally geared automatic transmission eliminates the derailleur and allows QuietKat to use a beefy motorcycle chain. They say the motorcycle chain is almost impossible to break and transfers power to the rear wheel better than a traditional bike chain. The mid-drive Apex XD offers five gears, but the hub-driven HD model has just two.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Motor and Battery:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-mid-drive-motor.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-mid-drive-motor.jpg\" alt=\"QuietKat Apex XD, mid-drive motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-mid-drive-motor.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-mid-drive-motor-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-mid-drive-motor-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-mid-drive-motor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-mid-drive-motor-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-mid-drive-motor-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hub-drive or mid-drive Apex models are both powered by a 1000w VPO (Variable Power Output) 2.0 motor. If that wasn’t enough, the motors have a 1500w climb mode that boosts their output to tackle steep climbs. The XD’s mid-drive motor cranks out a massive 200nm of torque, while the HD’s hub-drive unit will produce 85nm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The newly developed VPO 2.0 firmware offers five drive modes: Eco, Trail, and Boost modes are now joined by new Climb and Stealth modes. What’s really nifty is how the VPO compliance technology can switch the bikes between Class 1, 2, 3, or unlimited modes, thus making the Apex ebikes legal on any trail. Of course, you might have to convince enthusiastic law enforcers you’re not going to use your throttle where you shouldn’t! On that note, the Apex ebikes feature a twist throttle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-ebikes-down-tube-battery.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-ebikes-down-tube-battery.jpg\" alt=\"QuietKat Apex ebikes, down tube battery\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-ebikes-down-tube-battery.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-ebikes-down-tube-battery-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-ebikes-down-tube-battery-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-ebikes-down-tube-battery-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-ebikes-down-tube-battery-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-ebikes-down-tube-battery-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apex ebikes’ batteries are enclosed in the down tube, and buyers can choose between a 15Ah or a 30Ah version (both 48V). With a full charge, the 30Ah battery provides up to 90 miles of range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the Apex ebikes feature integrated smart technology. Built-in cellular, GPS, and IOT capabilities allow remote tracking, alarm, and locking features. The bikes also provide real-time battery statistics, maintenance reminders, and over-the-air firmware updates. A color LED display shows your metrics/settings, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Model Lineup:</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>QuietKat Apex HD</strong> – $2999-3599 (depending on options).</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-HD-angle.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"782\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-HD-angle.jpg\" alt=\"QuietKat Apex HD, angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-HD-angle.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-HD-angle-297x194.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-HD-angle-120x78.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-HD-angle-768x500.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Frame color options for the Apex HD are Veil Relic Camo, Moss, or Dull Grey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>QuietKat Apex XD</strong> – $4499 – 5099 (depending on options).</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-angle.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-angle.jpg\" alt=\"QuietKat Apex XD, angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-angle.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-angle-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-angle-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-angle-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-angle-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-angle-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apex XD’s frame color options are Charcoal, Red Clay, or Wideland Camo.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-ice-fishing.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-ice-fishing.jpg\" alt=\"QuietKat Apex ebike, ice fishing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-ice-fishing.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-ice-fishing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-ice-fishing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-ice-fishing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-ice-fishing-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QuietKat-Apex-XD-ice-fishing-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apex HD and XD are available to order now, with deliveries expected to begin in early June. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://quietkat.com/en-ca/pages/experience-apex-hd\">quietkat.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/quietkat-apex-automatic-transmission-adventure-ebikes-fat-bike-hunting-fishing/\">QuietKat’s New Apex Automatic Transmission Adventure eBikes Offer Tons of Features</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"128e620c1ed1f8de8bdc3e63ffe0ad365ff5115518963f2156415271d145dc1f","category":"Cycling"}
