It’s Saturday morning and the place is buzzing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Owner Marlon Plein is busy tidying up in preparation for <em>Cyclist</em>’s visit, meaning his girlfriend Lauren can’t now find the parts she needs for a bike she’s fixing up. Volunteer Jeff wheels in, slings his bike down by the entrance and heads off to make a round of teas. Bang on 12pm, local kid Yayah comes hurtling down the slope on his Mafia bike before pulling a wheelie.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gordy-bike-whisperer\">Meet Gordy, the Bike Whisperer</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/herne-hill-olympics\">75 years later: Marking Herne Hill velodrome’s Olympic anniversary</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/gifts-for-cyclists\">Best Christmas gifts for cyclists 2024: Bike-related present recommendations</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>‘He’s been coming pretty much every weekend for two years, learning mechanics and various tricks, so we said, “OK let’s get him a new bike,”’ Plein says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We set up a little Crowdfunder on Instagram and overnight we got all the money we needed, so last Saturday we gave it to him.

He’s able to do that – and help young people like Yayah get a bike – partly thanks to subsidised rent and rates, but also due to the loyal following he has built up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s circular. I might make a £2,000 bike for someone but then that trickles down. It’s beautiful.’</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also a donation hub. While <em>Cyclist</em> is there, someone drops off two carrier bags full of bike parts – seatposts, derailleurs, shoes – followed shortly after by someone else arriving to ask for a threaded one-inch fork for his road bike. Volunteers trickle in, kids arrive, passers-by pop in to ask what the deal is. It’s a self-sustaining ecosystem of bike enthusiasts.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Local hero Community Bike Shop BabyLDN\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The shop is able to charge low prices – or ask for donations if you want to tinker with your own bike – because much of its stock comes from donations.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>The Grand Depart</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A series of twists led Plein to this point. He was made redundant from his job in hospitality and turned to couriering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I thought I was done with London. I decided to go to Berlin but I had no spare cash. Some friends were doing deliveries so I decided to try that to earn some money, then leave.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He bought a single speed Fuji for £100 on eBay and an obsession was sparked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Scouting for the “perfect” bike drove me down a long tunnel that I’ve never recovered from,’ he says. ‘Getting a bike changed me. I got fitter, I got to learn the city, to meet new people.’ </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Local hero Community Bike Shop BabyLDN\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Lauren gets to work fixing up a customer’s bike.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Plein then got into mechanics, determined to ‘reanimate’ discarded bikes. He found ‘old clunkers’ everywhere from car boot sales to Ebay, bought a garden shed and converted it into a workshop. A couple of sales in, he launched his Instagram page and now he has eyes everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Every day I get about five DMs saying, “Hey, I think you might like this”, “I’ve got this to donate” or “This is going really cheap”. My neighbour recently found a Muddy Fox Streetfinder on the street and we’re just building it up.

As the name suggests, this is a bike shop that serves a community, but also one that has created a community. And for Plein it is a means of introducing young people to the magic of the bicycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I don’t think there’s another vehicle that can give you the peace and freedom in the city that a bike can,’ he says. ‘You’re able to pace your movement at your own will. You won’t be stuck with the tempo of the bus or the train or stuck with all the moody people on their phones. You can take it slow or you can ride fast. It’s the beacon of freedom in a city where most other things are bureaucratic or expensive.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Find out more at <a href=\"https://www.babyldn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">babyldn.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-08-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Local hero Community Bike Shop BabyLDN\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-08-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-08-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-08-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-08-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-08-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-08-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-08.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Customer creations: Sam’s flame-grilled fixie</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I saw this fixed gear bike on Gumtree and had to have it. The look came about because there was a stuck seatpost in the frame and when Marlon used a blowtorch to loosen it, the paint melted away and he realised it was chrome underneath, not steel. He stripped all the paint off with the blowtorch and it left these beautiful pearlescent scorched markings, so he just put clear coat lacquer over the top. I’ve not seen anything else like it.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-09-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Local hero Community Bike Shop BabyLDN\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-09-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-09-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-09-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-09-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-09-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-09-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/local-hero-158-babyldn-09.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Customer creations: Tom’s comfy cruiser</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This frame is a Diamondback Apex from 1994.

I really wanted the flat bar, a tray on the front and big gearing so I can go up any hill. We rescued and reused the stem, derailleurs and the seat from my old bike, which is basically moulded to my backside. I love the Mavic Aksium wheels; Marlon has scratched all the decals off, so they’re silver, which looks cool. You couldn’t get any bigger tyres on it, because I wanted them to be a comfortable ride, soft and bouncy.’</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/babyldn-community-bike-shop\">Building a community: BabyLDN and the Community Bike Shop</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"17011d6b858dc3e331ad77fd6febfb4f69e58623ccad534067d7148d97f7cb59","category":"Cycling"}
