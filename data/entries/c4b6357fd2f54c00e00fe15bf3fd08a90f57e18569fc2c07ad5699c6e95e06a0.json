Need to coordinate a crew of superheroes across the globe to save the world? A scheduler can help. Same for web applications that serve any group of collaborating users — whether that includes wearing a cape or not. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/03/event-calendars-web-commercial-options/\">Event calendars</a> and schedulers may often seem the same; sometimes, a calendar is all you need. However, a scheduler does a lot more than block out a day or time slot, especially for the “supervisors” and “managers”, i.e., the Nick Fury of the teams, who do more than give out assignments and due dates but also need to track the usage of available resources — like staffs’ work hours, or inanimate resources, like an operating room in a hospital — to ensure the efficiency of each task, resource, and process.</p>\n<p>In this post, you’ll find some of the best commercial web scheduler libraries (JavaScript based) with amazing UX and high efficiency that are currently available. Let’s dive in right away, shall we?</p>\nBryntum Scheduler\n<p>This super easy to integrate scheduler works seamlessly with any frontend stack such as Angular, React, Vue, or vanilla JS. The <a href=\"https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/\">Bryntum</a> website has examples in all the supported frameworks, and numerous <a href=\"https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/examples/\">sample use-cases</a> to assist your integration process. </p>\n<p>As for its appearance, if any of the modern themes provided with the scheduler won’t do so, you can quickly achieve a tailored look using CSS or SASS variable-based styling while still maintaining high-performance and responsive rendering throughout different screen sizes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/best-pro-scheduler-libraries/1-best-pro-scheduler-libraries.png\" /></p>\n<p>Now, the features are where the rubber meets the road. Drag and drop support; Export to Excel, PDF, and PNG; Custom data fields and filtering; Dependency arrows between events for process visualization; And many more. Here’s <a href=\"https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/features/\">a comprehensive list of their scheduler features</a> at Bryntum’s website.</p>\n<p>That’s not all. There’s a <a href=\"https://bryntum.com/products/schedulerpro/features/\">Pro version</a>. The highlight is the Resource Histogram — which is an intuitive overview of resource allocation. Additionally, there’s <a href=\"https://bryntum.com/products/schedulerpro/examples/travel-time/\">Travel time visualization</a>, <a href=\"https://bryntum.com/products/schedulerpro/examples/resource-non-working-time/\">Overview of non-working hours</a>, <a href=\"https://bryntum.com/products/schedulerpro/examples/skill-matching/\">Skill matching</a>, and more in the Pro tool chest. Plus, rewiring any of the default actions to your liking is an effortless undertaking due to the many configuration settings provided in the API.</p>\n<p>Support is available by means of professional services, active <a href=\"https://forum.bryntum.com/\">forums</a>, and a slew of <a href=\"https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/docs/guide/Scheduler/quick-start/javascript\">exhaustive documentation</a> comprising live demos. You can start a <a href=\"https://bryntum.com/download/?product=scheduler\">45-day free trial</a> right away or <a href=\"https://bryntum.com/contact/\">contact their sales team</a> for any inquiries regarding pricing and features.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/best-pro-scheduler-libraries/2-best-pro-scheduler-libraries.png\" /></p>\nDHTMLX Scheduler\n<p>Here is another modern scheduler with the availability of integrations with over ten different frameworks, including some of the popular JavaScript ones like jQuery. The <a href=\"https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxScheduler/\">DHTMLX</a> scheduler offers a default theme (in both light and dark mode) uses gradients to standout. However, if that’s not your cup of tea, and neither is any of the other themes, there’s also the option to tinker under the CSS hood to customize the look.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/best-pro-scheduler-libraries/3-best-pro-scheduler-libraries.png\" /></p>\n<p>Apart from the fundamental features, like being able to set up recurring appointments, and the Pro features, there’s also a Google Maps integration to include rich location data to the events. In <a href=\"https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxScheduler/features.shtml\">Pro version</a>, there’s the multiple resource view — the overview of allocated resources — that comes handy in delegating tasks, and to track the efficiency of each delegation. PDF export is available as an add-on.</p>\n<p>Support is accessible through technical requests, forums, and <a href=\"https://docs.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/\">API documentation</a>. A 30-day free trial can be opted. For licensing and pricing, you can <a href=\"https://dhtmlx.com/docs/contact.shtml\">drop them a message or schedule a call</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/best-pro-scheduler-libraries/4-best-pro-scheduler-libraries.png\" /></p>\nMindFusion Scheduler\n<p>Although not feature-extensive but budget-friendly, the <a href=\"https://www.mindfusion.eu/javascript-scheduler.html\">MindFusion</a> scheduler (ready to download and test) is a good place to start if its rudimentary components are enough to get the job done for you and you don’t mind rolling up your sleeves to do a little revamp.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/best-pro-scheduler-libraries/5-best-pro-scheduler-libraries.png\" /></p>\n<p>Basics like appointments, multiple calendar views, drag-and-drop, timetables for resources, and such are covered.

However, the Pro version is something not to be missed out on. The period for technical support for the Pro version is less than that of what <a href=\"https://javascript.daypilot.org/\">DayPilot</a> ’s peers offer, but it doesn’t skimp on features and is within a reasonable price for a single developer plan.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/best-pro-scheduler-libraries/7-best-pro-scheduler-libraries.png\" /></p>\n<p>Most features expected to be in a Pro version are included, like the Resources overview, Resources utilization snapshot, comprehensive filtering, drag and drop, export options, etc. Besides the handful of themes provided, custom styling can be done with CSS. Some <a href=\"https://javascript.daypilot.org/tutorials/\">samples</a> are also available to learn from.</p>\n<p>The scheduler works with most of the common JavaScript libraries, and <a href=\"https://doc.daypilot.org/\">documentations</a> are present for each separately. Support is available through forums and email. You can <a href=\"https://www.daypilot.org/contact/\">contact them</a> for quotes and licensing queries. There’s a 60-days trial available. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/best-pro-scheduler-libraries/8-best-pro-scheduler-libraries.png\" /></p>\nSyncfusion Scheduler\n<p>With a complete keyboard interaction setup, <a href=\"https://www.syncfusion.com/javascript-ui-controls/js-scheduler\">Syncfusion Scheduler</a> is accessible and friendly.

There’s a theme builder, too, to assist in creating a custom theme. And a few UI kits, like one for Adobe XD, is provided with the scheduler.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://helpej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/schedule/getting-started\">API documentation</a> is available for all supported integrations.
