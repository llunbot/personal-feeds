I was inspired by a custom <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/isaos-falconer-mini-velo-got-the-baja-bug-treatment-kyle-kelley/\">mini velo from Falconer</a> and my time on the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/velo-oranges-neutrino-a-minivelo-with-big-capabilities/\">Velo Orange Mini Velo.</a> While I enjoyed Velo Orange’s version of the mini velo, I had always thought a Ritchey Break-Away version would be a real home run for packing really really small. Lo and behold, Matt finally answered my wish and made the Stupid Tourist. Although nowadays I’m not ramblin’ around nearly as much as I used to, nonetheless, I’m enamored with the idea of the Stupid Tourist.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-21.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Matt wanted the bike to feel like a normal bike, but with very small wheels. The size of the front triangle and the geo numbers reflect this impetus. I recall Matt mentioning that originally he wanted to be able to fit the bike into some wild baffled travel bag that would also serve as the frame bag. I entertained this crazy notion for a few days, and after some fiddling and measuring decided to leave it as a fool’s errand. When you see the size of the suitcase I used, that will become clear. The Stupid Tourist prioritizes frame space since mini velo bikes always require a very long steerer tube due to the small wheel diameter. One might as well have a huge headtube instead of tons of spacers. In the end, the Stupid Tourist has a big bike feel with small wheels. The reach, stack, and wheelbase numbers can all be a bit longer than folding bikes since the frame comes apart rather than relying entirely on very compact geometry.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mini-Velo-Sizing-Chart-Metric.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mini-Velo-Sizing-Chart-Metric.png?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mini-Velo-Sizing-Chart-Metric.png?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Mini-Velo-Sizing-Chart-Metric.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-19.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-19.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Frame reviews are always difficult as, unlike a built bicycle, a bare frame functions as a blank canvas. So many factors are dependent on choices made during the parts build. I want to highlight a few aspects of speccing such an eccentric frame as they are nonstandard. This review might read more as a how-to guide for building and breaking down the Stupid Tourist, rather than a critical assessment of how it rides.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>$1250 Frame</li>\n<li>Two sizes (~55 cm &amp; 60 cm)\n<ul>\n<li>Small 5’7″ and under</li>\n<li>Large 5’8″ and above</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ritchey Break-Away couplers</li>\n<li>Disc or Canti/V-brake</li>\n<li>20″ wheels (2.6″ clearance)</li>\n<li>12 mm x 100/142 mm wheel spacing on disc version</li>\n<li>Standard quick release 9 x 100/130 spacing on canti version</li>\n<li>Adjustable rear dropout on disc, fixed rear on canti</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-3.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-3.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-2.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Small Wheels, Micro Shift, and Big Dreams</h3>\n<p>I tested the larger of the two sizes, with a 60 cm effective top tube. Being 6’1″ with a 33″ inseam, I still needed a lot of seatpost and riser bar to finagle a reasonable riding position. I paired the Stupid Tourist with Surly’s <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/surly-sunset-bar-and-dugout-feed-bags-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunset Bar</a> with 110 mm of rise. In hindsight, using an 820 mm wide bar for a travel bike was silly and one of the limiting factors for packing, but I love my wide and tall bars. Crust supplied the wheelset, headset, and brakes for the build. With a little help from Microshift and Ritchey, I had a bike. I had to get a Ritchey seatpost to hold together the Ritchey Break-Away coupler, c’mon.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-5.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-5.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-14.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-14.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Due to the small 20″ wheels, most standard derailleurs hang too low for adequate ground clearance. Due to this fact, I needed to run a very short cage derailleur for my Stupid Tourist build. Luckily Microshift offers two <a href=\"https://www.microshift.com/news/introducing-super-short/\" target=\"_blank\">Super Short groupsets</a>, Acolyte (8 speed) and Advent (9 speed). The old standby of a Shimano Zee would be a solid 10-speed option, though the range of Zee is slightly smaller at 36 teeth max, whereas the Microshift Advent derailleur tops out at 38 teeth. Those are your off-the-shelf options, as there is not a lot of support for very short cage derailleurs.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>To lean into the packability of the whole build, I decided to utilize wireless shifting. I used my Archer Components (now defunct) <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/archer-components-d1x-trail-shifter/\" target=\"_blank\">D1x shifter</a> and remote. I snagged a water bottle mount from Archer before they ran out of stock and this allowed me to leave the whole shifting setup on the rear triangle during packing, nice and tidy. I’m so bummed Archer went out of business since the Stupid Tourist is a perfect use of their open-ended approach to wireless shifting. Le Sighhhhhh.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-13.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-13.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-15.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-15.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Finding a 20″ thru axle wheelset with an HG freehub is not an easy proposition, so Crust will be offering wheelsets with the frame. The rims are single-wall box rims like a BMX bike and thus are not tubeless-ready. Can you use <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/vintage-mtb-tubeless-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">tons of tubeless tape</a> and make them work tubeless? Possibly. I just opted to use tubes for simplicity. Did you know Kenda is the only company offering a 20″ x 2.4″ tube with a Presta valve? I learned so many things while building this bike. Shoutout to Kenda for some sweet 20″ tires and tubes for this silly rig. While packing, I had to completely deflate both tires, so in this case, having tubes was easier and less messy than tubeless. A little birdie told me that <a href=\"https://astralcycling.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Astral Cycling</a> will soon have some tubeless-ready 20″ rims, if you fancy such things.</p>\n<p><em>It looks like Crust will also offer a cantilever rim brake version of the frame to throw your aging parts bin pile at!</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-10.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Mini Tinker Tantrums</h3>\n<p>The Stupid Tourist almost warranted its own separate episode of Tinker Tantrums, but we’re gonna slip it in here.</p>\n<p>So, my Stupid Tourist came with the fiddly Ritchey Break-Away cable connectors and I was determined to use them. I believe the frame was intended for use with full-length housing, long enough to fold easily when disassembled, as it has no accommodations for a break in the cable housing. I saw a challenge to try and utilize the Break-Away system to its full extent. I cut up an old bolt-on downtube cable stop, making two cable stops to mount on the cable bosses. This allowed me to create a break in the rear brake cabling. Was this more work than just running full length housing? Yes. Was it a fun project? Yes. Did it work? Mostly.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-11.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-11.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-12.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-12.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Another small issue I ran into while building up the Stupid Tourist was the size of the head tube. When attempting to use a standard Park Tool headset press, I found the headtube to be about 1″ too long to use the tool. The same goes for the crown race, which involved stacking many assorted drifts to smash it on. In the end, I used a hammer and a piece of wood to install my headset. Matt would be proud. I want everyone to be prepared for a nonstandard build process if you get one of the large Stupid Tourist frames.</p>\n<p>The Stupid Tourist has 3-pack mounts on the fork and accommodations for mini front racks. It also features two rear rack mounts on the seat stays, with fender and rack mounts on the dropouts. With the small wheels, fitting regular-sized racks gets weird. I hope to try a <a href=\"https://velo-orange.com/products/flat-pack-randonneur-rack?srsltid=AfmBOooraOmeMxqN0nj-dMVjbQhnw7BY-QSShDeWkD-6nAUAjSs820qw\">Velo Orange Flat Pack rack</a> in the future because I think it will fit appropriately and, you know, pack flat. Hopefully, I can find a great excuse to fly this thing somewhere cool for some small-wheeled adventures in the future.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-24.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-24.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Packing the Stupid Tourist</h3>\n<p>Originally I had planned to pack the whole rig into a 90-liter duffel. Initially, the frame and wheels fit inside that bag, but once everything was built out there was no way I was getting it all in that bag. Matt had recommended using a boogie board case, something he had used for a BMX bike while traveling in the past. For me, they all seemed too sparsely padded to feel confident flying the bike to NYC.</p>\n<p>Days before I left, I realized my duffel bag was too small and I panicked. Collecting myself, I rushed to my favorite local thrift store in hopes of finding something that could work. With some rough dimensional measurements, I sized up a few suitcases. I wound up with a military issue satchel and a worn-out suitcase to try. In the end, the suitcase (28″ x 21″ x 9″) was a perfect, if not a very tight fit, for the Stupid Tourist. If you really wanted to ball out you could get a <a href=\"https://ritcheylogic.com/bike/accessories/break-away-bike-travel-bag-deluxe-with-wheels?srsltid=AfmBOorV1O6lNgYBDjioSzYsOgshU8pptDyCclS-zijDqeAssnbUWAn_\" target=\"_blank\">Ritchey Breakaway case ($389)</a> with its dimensions at 31″ x 26.5″ x 8.5″, it should handily carry the Stupid Tourist. I bet the wheels on the suitcase work much better too. I wanted to use the smallest possible case so I went with the thrift store special. In hindsight, a Breakaway bag, my Orucase Ninja, or even an <a href=\"https://www.ticycles.com/components/ss-soft-case-10-backpack\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;S bag</a> would have been a smarter choice, but hey… I’m just a stupid tourist.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-25.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-25.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-26.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-26.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>To make everything fit in a way that didn’t feel sketchy, I was required to disassemble the bike completely. I’m talking fork off, wheels off, rotors off, crankset off, everything but the headset and bottom bracket cups came off to fit in that little suitcase. Make sure you feel comfortable with this level of disassembly if you plan to utilize the collapsible aspects of the Stupid Tourist.</p>\n<p>Using the suitcase instead of the backpack duffel now left me with an issue, how to transport this suitcase on the bike? After a quick customization of a shitty Sunlite rack – badabing, badaboom – I had a front rack. Yeah, the tire clearance was way too tight, but it survived the trip! Now I could strap the suitcase to the front rack, using the ample fork to bar height to transport myself and the “bike case” throughout my trip.</p>\n<h3>I Only Ride Mini Velos In NYC</h3>\n<p>I find it entertaining that my last two trips to NYC have been accompanied by a mini velo bike. Tiny wheels in a big city just make sense. The zippy feeling of the smaller wheels perfectly accompanies darting between traffic and makes navigating tight apartment stairways a breeze. The Stupid Tourist’s geometry makes it easy to forget you are riding a small bike. Once my brain adapted to the quick handling of the smaller wheels, the bike blended into the background and I just rode. Zipping around the city and the country roads of Nutmeg was equally enjoyable aboard the Stupid Tourist.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-17.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-17.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-18.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-18.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>With clearance for 2.4″ tires, the Stupid Tourist opens some off-road doors. With a few knobby options in the 20″ range, you could build an offroad capable Stupid Tourist. You will find your pedals and derailleur very close to the ground, so be careful. I don’t think using this as a dedicated off road touring rig is the way, but I’ve had much stupider ideas, so go wild!</p>\n<h3>Future Forecast: Even Sillier Ideas</h3>\n<p>Since my trip in October I’ve got the Stupid Tourist built back up and out of its suitcase tomb. after all my tinkering, I decided to forgo a rear brake(I only had one spare BB7). I added a 50mm SRAM AXS dropper, which was given to me on my trip specifically for such silliness (Thanks Max!). There is probably far too much tech on such a bike, but what kind of tourist doesn’t bring their USB splitter to charge all the things on a trip? Gotta have some tech.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-4.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-4.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-11.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-11.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-12.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-12.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-12.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Crust-Bikes-Stupid-Tourist-Review-12.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>There are so many possibilities with this stupid platform. I always dreamed of using a bike like this for bike touring and with its huge front triangle filled with a frame bag, I could probably fit most of my camping gear in there alone. This would possibly be the first triple decker (zippered partitions) framebag I’ve seen. That may be a sewing feat for another day. Having a bike like the Stupid Tourist around simplifies the prospect of traveling with a bike. Maybe I’ll track down some Vee 20 x 2.6″ tires for an offroad stupid tour? With so many possibilities, have no fear that you haven’t seen the last of this bike on the site…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-1-final.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-1-final.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-1-final.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2025_Crust_Stupid_Tourist_Review-1-final.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Most packable mini velo I’ve seen to date</li>\n<li>Big bike geometry fits surprisingly normal</li>\n<li>Amazing speckled paint job</li>\n<li>Sliding dropout and frame break for belt drive capability.</li>\n<li>Ritchey Break-Away couplers are simple and easy to use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Odd wheelset necessitates a custom wheel build or just buy from Crust</li>\n<li>No accommodation for cable stops to use Break-Away cable couplers</li>\n<li>Head/steerer tube length makes installing a headset difficult on the larger size frame</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>How would you build up a <a href=\"https://crustbikes.com/products/stupid-tourist-description-details-photos?variant=50313684418871\" target=\"_blank\">Stupid Tourist</a>?
