Apple removed cloud syncing from the original Beddit app in 2018, released an updated version of the accessory <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/apple-beddit-3-5-sleep-monitor/\">with fewer features</a> in 2019, and stopped selling the accessory entirely in 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeddit's thin, flexible sensor strip could be placed on a mattress for sleep tracking purposes. It is likely that Apple acquired Beddit to bolster development of sleep tracking on the Apple Watch, which debuted as part of watchOS 7 in 2020.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have not confirmed if the Beddit apps still function for existing customers.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beddit/\">Beddit</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/30/apple-removes-beddit-apps-from-app-store/\">Apple Removes Beddit Apps From App Store Following 2017 Acquisition</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-removes-beddit-apps-from-app-store-following-2017-acquisition.2438643/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5dda036273d2667a6a1491de019ecef45a3f9775305663264da011876d279f1c","category":"Apple"}
