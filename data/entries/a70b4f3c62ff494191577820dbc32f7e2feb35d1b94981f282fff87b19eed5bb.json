We call it Apple Breakfast because we think it goes great with a morning cup of coffee or tea, but it’s cool if you want to give it a read during lunch or dinner hours too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>‘Loose’ change</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Defying all expectations, Apple last week sent out invitations to a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2312605/surprise-apple-announces-let-loose-event-on-may-5.html\">special event</a> on May 7. Based on the artwork (which features an Apple Pencil and an artistic Apple logo) and the lack of new Apple tablets since 2022, you can be virtually certain that iPads are back on the menu… but based on the fact that Apple decided to do this at an event rather than via a less ostentatious press release, there might be a few surprises too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New AirPods and AirPods Max</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The promotional artwork strongly implies that iPads are the stars of the show, but that isn’t necessarily the case: Apple might want to keep back something more exciting for the “one more thing” slot. And I would argue that more people care about new AirPods than new iPads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s reason to hope, too. In December the generally reliable Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2174810/three-brand-new-sets-airpods-on-way-report.html\">predicted</a> that 2024 would see the launch of not one but two standard AirPods models (one with active noise cancellation, one without), and a new set of AirPods Max to boot. And there is a precedent for Apple releasing new AirPods in the spring: the 2nd-gen AirPods came out in March 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Max in particular desperately need an update. They weren’t completely convincing at launch, but over the past three and a half years they’ve aged like milk thanks to their lack of an H2 chip, USB-C, and Lossless Audio. My colleague, in fact, thinks Apple should <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2002360/apple-needs-to-totally-rethink-airpods-max.html\">scrap them and start over</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2285151/airpods-max-lite-new-models-fourth-quarter-2024.html\">report</a> near the start of April suggested the 2nd-gen AirPods Max won’t arrive until the fall, but don’t rule out a surprise appearance on May 7.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3802670/airpods_max_review_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"AirPods Max review\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"AirPods Max review\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>David Price / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"AirPods Max review\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>David Price / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>David Price / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>A HomePod with a screen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been hearing for some time that Apple is about to refresh its smart-home strategy, but it’s still not clear what that will entail. One theory is that it’s going to upgrade the humble <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod by adding a screen</a> so it can act as a hub without being so dependent on Siri. You’d also be able to use it for FaceTime calls and watching news reports while you eat your breakfast–handy for a device you could install in the kitchen. Some reports have suggested that the HomePod with a screen will simply be an iPad that attaches to a HomePod dock. That would certainly fit the event’s iPad motif.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like updated AirPods, a new HomePod could just about fit into the creative “Let Loose” theme of the event; if you check the animated artwork in Tim Cook’s tweet you’ll notice some musical iconography in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Pencil us in for May 7! ✏️ <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2311282-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">#AppleEvent</a> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/1tvyB7h450&amp;xcust=1-1-2311282-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/1tvyB7h450</a></p>— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1782785458881302714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2311282-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 23, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>All of the iPads</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple rarely updates an entire range all at once. The MacBook Air gets a refresh at a different time to the Mac Pro, the iPhone SE is announced at a different time of year than the flagship iPhone, and the various iPad models appear on an unpredictable staggered timetable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s just possible that might change this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Logically we’re only expecting new versions of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/2024-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">iPad Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">iPad Air</a>, each of which has been the subject of multiple rumors and supply-chain leaks. (This also tracks with the discovery of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2289217/ips-air-pro-new-model-numbers-bureau-of-indian-standards.html\">four unreleased models</a> on the Bureau of Indian Standards website, which would match the two sizes of Pro and Air respectively.) This remains by far the most likely outcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Apple has two other iPad lines, and these are just as sorely in need of an update as the Pro and Air. The 10th-gen iPad came out in October 2022, at the same time as the last iPad Pro, while the 6th-gen iPad mini came out in 2021 and is positively ancient. (Clue-hunting readers might be wondering why Apple is holding the event at an unusually early hour of 7 am PT on May 7, and whether this might point to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">7th-gen iPad mini</a> being a significant element. I’m… not entirely convinced by that, but it’s a fun idea.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wait since any iPads were announced is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2315689/the-ridiculously-long-wait-for-ipads-has-reached-18-months.html\">getting ridiculous</a>. It’s a long shot, but we might end up with an entire set of new iPads this May.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>But don’t expect…</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some announcements that wouldn’t merely be a surprise: they would be a miracle. Here are the product launches that I’d put below a 1% probability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New iPhones:</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16</a> (and 16 Plus, Pro and Pro Max) will come out in the fall. And the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">next iPhone SE</a> is unlikely to appear before 2025. Every time Apple holds an event our iPhone rumor articles light up with optimistic readers, but it’s not going to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New Apple Watches:</strong> Same story as the iPhones. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch Series 10/X</a> won’t be here until September (possibly accompanied by a third-gen Ultra) and while the last Apple Watch SE came out 19 months ago, it seems to be a following a two-yearly release cycle and there haven’t been any relevant leaks from the supply chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A new version of Siri:</strong> Oh, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1957801/siri-disaster-apple-doesnt-care.html\">I wish</a>. But this is an announcement for WWDC, assuming Apple is prepared to admit that Siri 1.0 was horrible. Which it probably isn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The next version of the Vision Pro:</strong> Far, far too early. Expect this in 2025 at the earliest, and quite possibly 2026.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3811721/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trending: Top stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will finally <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2312605/surprise-apple-announces-let-loose-event-on-may-5.html\">let its new iPads ‘Loose’</a> at a <strong>surprising May event</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it wants us to <strong>buy new stuff</strong> all the time, Apple needs to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2314153/ai-is-the-key-to-boosting-apple-hardware-sales.html\">become a software company</a> again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peter Müller switched from an <strong>iPhone 14 Pro</strong> to an iPhone 15 and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2314224/iphone-14-pro-iphone-15-switch-processor-display-design.html\">hasn’t looked back</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forget <strong>iPhone 16</strong>, Apple’s most important new product this year is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2311532/iphone-ios-18-ai-large-language-model-upgrade.html\">on-device AI</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FineWoven</strong> will join a long line of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2311687/short-lived-apple-failures-finewoven-power-mac-g4-cube-macintosh-xl-tv-emate-ipod-hifi.html\">short-lived Apple failures</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new <strong>Snapdragon X chips</strong> are faster than an M3, but <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2313991/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-chips-performance-battery-efficiency-apple-m3.html\">should we believe it</a>?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Podcast of the week</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple announces a <strong>May 7 event</strong>.
