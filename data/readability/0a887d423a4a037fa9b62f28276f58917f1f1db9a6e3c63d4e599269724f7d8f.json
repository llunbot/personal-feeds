Today’s your lucky day.</p><p>The internet strikes again, this time in the form of a step-by-step tutorial video for engineering a DIY hubless fat bike. Visual learners can proceed directly to the video. For all the verbal learners out there, here’s a rough step-by-step.</p><p><span><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMUrJhet-1M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\" ezoid=\"0.5455906624425606\"></iframe></span></p><h2>How to build a Tron bike: teardown, re-engineer</h2><p>Step 1: remove wheels from the bike, then remove tubes (if present) and tires.<br>Step 2: remove hub and spokes. You now have a bare rim and can perhaps begin to visualize your Tron bike…<br>Step 3: if you’re watching the video, skip from 1:15-2:15 to avoid an embedded ad for cybersecurity software.<br>Step 4: cut a ring that will fit on the outside of your rim from a sheet of solid stainless steel. (Note: specialty tools may be required to complete this step.)<br>Step 5: weld bearings into the ring. (Harvest from skateboard wheels if necessary.)<br>Step 6: attach threaded posts to the existing ring, then fabricate another ring (no bearings needed). Fit your rim between the two rings.<br>Step 7: Modify forks for the new hubless system (too complicated to explain; see video).<br>Step 8: Repeat steps 1-7, drop your wheels into your modified forks, and go ride!</p><p>Whether or not you get a light suit to wear while you’re riding it, your new Tron bike is certain to stun casual bystanders. In all likelihood, it will also cause your friends to shake their heads in puzzlement at the ways you choose to spend your time.</p><p>Your Tron bike promises to get you through fair weather, but what will you do when the streets ice over, and you still need a ridiculous retrofitted rig?
