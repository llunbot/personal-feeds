Attention to breathing is generally considered to be a foundational component of mindfulness practice, and long-term mindfulness training is associated with reliable differences in resting respiration rate, according to empirical research. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Watch can already track respiration rate while wearers are sleeping. Apple Watch uses its built-in accelerometer, which measures vibration and movement, to determine how many times a person breathes each minute. While the Vision Pro also has an accelerometer, it's unclear whether this hardware or sensors that track changes in facial musculature would be involved when a mindfulness session is in progress. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's no information suggesting if or when the feature could make an appearance, but Apple is expected to announce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a> 2 at its annual developers conference, WWDC, which begins next week, June 10.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/apple-vision-pro-mindfulness-respiration/\">Apple Vision Pro Mindfulness App May Get 'Respiration Tracking' Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-mindfulness-app-may-get-respiration-tracking-feature.2428034/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"daa58f96a5e954bdab1659a9bb5ace164ca3e453b9f191d1f970157446d698f1","category":"Apple"}
