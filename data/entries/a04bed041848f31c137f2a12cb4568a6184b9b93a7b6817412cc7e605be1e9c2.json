It augments signal transmission stability for high-capacity data ports and extends transmission ranges. Such chips are seen in other Thunderbolt/USB 4 devices, and <em>ChargerLab</em> believes it is clearly identifiable on the ‌iPhone 15‌'s USB-C components.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four ‌iPhone 15‌ models are expected to feature USB-C instead of Lightning. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models with USB-C ports are expected to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/16/iphone-15-high-speed-data-transfer/\">support higher-speed data transfers</a>, likely up to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/17/iphone-15-pro-thunderbolt-port-rumor/\">Thunderbolt speeds</a>, while the standard ‌iPhone 15‌ models will likely continue to feature USB 2.0 speeds – the same as Lightning. For comparison, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> features a Thunderbolt port for transfer speeds up to 40 Gbps, while the entry-level <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>'s USB-C port is limited to just 480 Mbps.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chargerlab/\">ChargerLab</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thunderbolt-4/\">Thunderbolt 4</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/16/some-iphone-15-models-feature-thunderbolt-speeds/\">Images Suggest Some iPhone 15 Models Could Feature Thunderbolt Data Transfer Speeds</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/images-suggest-some-iphone-15-models-could-feature-thunderbolt-data-transfer-speeds.2398792/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a04bed041848f31c137f2a12cb4568a6184b9b93a7b6817412cc7e605be1e9c2","category":"Apple"}
