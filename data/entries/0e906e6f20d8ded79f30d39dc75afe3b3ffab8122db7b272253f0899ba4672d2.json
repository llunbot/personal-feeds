The idea is that my head is cold like ice while racing, but my legs are always on fire and Colnago has delivered frozen colours to represent this dichotomy.' </p>\n<p>For more details on Pogačar's bike, visit <a href=\"https://www.colnago.com/en/IceAndFire/\" target=\"_blank\">colnago.com</a>. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bikes\">Bikes</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0e906e6f20d8ded79f30d39dc75afe3b3ffab8122db7b272253f0899ba4672d2","category":"Cycling"}
