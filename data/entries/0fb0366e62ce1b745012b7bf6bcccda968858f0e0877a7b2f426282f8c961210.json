Kuo did not reveal any specific changes planned for the Apple Watch Ultra 3, which will presumably launch in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA third-generation Apple Watch SE is also a possibility this year if Apple sticks to a two-year upgrade cycle for that model, but the successor to the Apple Watch Series 9 is not entirely clear. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously reported about a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/\">redesigned \"Apple Watch X\"</a> with a thinner case and magnetic bands, but he said it would be released \"in 2024 or 2025,\" so it is not clear if it will launch this year or next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn any case, Gurman previously said the model that succeeds the Apple Watch Series 9 will offer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/2024-apple-watch-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea/\">blood pressure sensing and sleep apnea detection</a>, and these features would almost certainly extend to the Apple Watch Ultra 3.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe original Apple Watch was unveiled in September 2014, and launched in April 2015, so the device is approaching its tenth anniversary.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/kuo-on-apple-watch-ultra-3-hardware/\">Kuo: Apple Watch Ultra to Get 'Almost No' Hardware Upgrades This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-watch-ultra-to-get-almost-no-hardware-upgrades-this-year.2425251/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0fb0366e62ce1b745012b7bf6bcccda968858f0e0877a7b2f426282f8c961210","category":"Apple"}
