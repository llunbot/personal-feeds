You have to buy parts through their system, then have the repair validated via a chat system. Otherwise, you'll run into limited or missing functionality, with a side of annoying warnings.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\niFixit is referring to Apple's post-repair System Configuration software tool, which \"authenticates genuine Apple parts, updates firmware, and calibrates parts to ensure maximum performance and quality,\" according to Apple. In June, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/20/apple-expands-self-service-repair-program/\">announced</a> that customers completing their own repairs can now initiate System Configuration by placing their devices into Diagnostics mode and following the on-screen prompts.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\niFixit's blog post provides an overview of the various functional issues and warnings that can arise when System Configuration is not completed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll in all, while iFixit acknowledges that Apple has made some progress in the Right to Repair area, it has decided that it needs to hold the company to a higher standard, and it has adjusted its repairability scoring system accordingly.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/\">iFixit</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/ifixit-lowers-iphone-14-repairability-score/\">iFixit Lowers iPhone 14's Repairability Score Due to Apple's Parts Pairing Requirement</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-lowers-iphone-14s-repairability-score-due-to-apples-parts-pairing-requirement.2403303/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"77b72ff3e29590235e542fb8d592550adabeb93e7cc1e5d3136d7758442bbd62","category":"Apple"}
