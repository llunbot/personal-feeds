{"title":"#RIDEWITHREGGIE + MOOTS","link":"https://moots.com/ridewithreggie-moots/","date":1635445777000,"content":"<p>Starting several years ago a connection was made with Reggie Miller and Moots. Reggie was getting into cycling<span></span> and wanted to ride a bike that really fit him well so he could continue to exercise and embrace this new-to-him social aspect of getting out with fellow riders. Reggie is a former NBA legend, hall-of-famer, and just one hell of a nice guy. The nice guy aspect of Reggie really drew us in from the start. It’s not often that you get to meet a famous person that really is as down-to-earth as they come. Enter Reggie’s first Moots…..back when we built dual-suspension bikes we made an exception to our rule of not doing custom. Those bikes get complicated quick, but we could not resist getting Reggie on a Moots. That custom dual suspension mountain bike led to a custom road bike before disc brakes were a thing. Catching up to early 2021 we delivered Reggie a custom <a href=\"https://moots.com/reggie-miller-upping-the-game-with-a-custom-vamoots-disc-rsl/\">Vamoots Disc RSL</a> as he has taken to the road to train for mountain bike races. You may have seen this beauty all dressed out in…..Indiana Pacers colors. Gold anodized by Moots, fitting with blue bits wherever they would fit.<span> </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Ride-With-Reggie-32.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Ride-With-Reggie-31.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>GOING BEYOND STAR STATUS</p>\n<p>Reggie is a huge advocate for great causes and movements. In 2020 he launched the SAY THEIR NAMES JERSEY to benefit Equal Justice Initiative a 501(c) (3) organization committed to ending mass incarceration and challenging racial and economic injustice in the United States. The jersey was a big hit and raised awareness industry wide.<span> </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Ride-With-Reggie-23.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Ride-With-Reggie-28.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>#RIDEWITHREGGIE + MOOTS<span> </span></p>\n<p>Just launched this week is Reggie’s #ridewithreggie campaign to raise funds for Historically Black Universities and Colleges, more to the point their cycling programs that are underfunded or do not exist at all.
