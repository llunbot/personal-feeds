Deciding to wait (or not to wait) also involves gauging the value of the potential reward. In an experiment that investigated wait times among people with lesions in the frontal cortex of the brain, University of Pennsylvania psychologist Joe Kable and his research team found that subjects with damage to certain regions of the prefrontal cortex were less likely to wait things out.</p>\n<p>“[Our] findings suggest that regions of the frontal cortex make computationally distinct contributions to adaptive persistence,” he and his team said in a <a href=\"https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2024/11/18/JNEUROSCI.0068-24.2024\">study</a> recently published in the Journal of Neuroscience.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/when-does-your-brain-think-something-is-worth-the-wait/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/when-does-your-brain-think-something-is-worth-the-wait/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d88e0b5f1f231597df216ee95a7c749aae1a98ce520bf3dba68f7c6dc07f5a09","category":"Tech"}
