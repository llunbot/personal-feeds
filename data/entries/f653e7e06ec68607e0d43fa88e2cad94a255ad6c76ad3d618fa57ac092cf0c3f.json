This allows the fit to be customised by altering seatpost setback.</span></p>\n<p><span>The top tube dips slightly before the cockpit, while the sides sweep inwards creating a triangular profile to slice through the air. The seat tube curves around the rear wheel in an attempt to further minimise drag.</span></p>\n<p><span>The carbon stem comes in 18 sizes, ranging from 55mm to 140mm, so you can adjust to suit your preferred position and riding style. </span></p>\n<p><span>While Look makes its own cranks, the brand says the frameset is compatible with any track crank. Look recommends pairing the Vitesse with Corima WS1 carbon race wheels available in 32, 47 and 58mm depths.  </span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Look Vitesse 895 frameset costs £3,790.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Look</i></span></div>\n<p><span>You can order the 895 Vitesse via Look dealers, with prices starting at</span><span> £3,790 / €3,790 / $4,500. </span></p>\n<p><span>It is available as a frameset only in extra small, small, medium or large and two colour schemes. </span><span>In a nod to the “heritage of track racing”, Look says the Cote d’Azur colour is inspired by the blue boards on the inside of a velodrome. </span></p>\n<p><span>The second option, Pro Team Black Mat, mimics the stealthy aesthetics of the French manufacturer’s Olympic bikes.  </span></p>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"f653e7e06ec68607e0d43fa88e2cad94a255ad6c76ad3d618fa57ac092cf0c3f","category":"Cycling"}
