The latest <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alleged-ios-18-design-resource-reveals-visionos-like-redesign.2423376/&amp;xcust=1-1-2286762-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">comes from MacRumors</a> and it could indicate the first major iOS design change in years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to an alleged template from Apple’s iOS 18 Design Resources, the Camera app may get a visual overhaul in 2024. The image shows a Camera app that isn’t dramatically different than the current interface, but it clearly shows a new design language with a gray gradient rather than solid black borders. Additionally, the buttons at the top and the zoom options in the viewfinder appear to have some depth around the edges rather than the flat components that have been used since iOS 7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, all of the elements are in the same place as the iOS 17 app and there are no other obvious changes. The circular elements that iOS has been rumored to adopt from visionOS are present, though the current app has circular buttons as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MacRumors throws some doubt into the veracity of the image, but even if it’s true, it’s unclear if it represents any changes. While the design language has a distinct visionOS feel, it’s unclear whether the image is an actual representation of what the app will look like on an iPhone or if elements have been altered to show design elements. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there have been rumors that iOS 18 will get a visionOS-style makeover and reports have said the OS will be one of the biggest updates in history.
