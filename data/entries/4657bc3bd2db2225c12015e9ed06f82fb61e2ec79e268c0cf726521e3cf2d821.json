At least for the Fenix 8 and Venu 3, however notably, not for the Epix Pro &amp; Fenix 7 Pro, which share the same sensor and already have US ECG capability.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, for EU &amp; Australian people, you can now activate the Fenix 8 and Venu 3 immediately, using the Garmin Connect app. See the last section in this post on how to get started, and things to know.</p>\n<h3><strong>Making Sense Of It All:</strong></h3>\n<p>Now, as background, all Garmin ELEVATE V5 watches are capable of ECG from a technical sense. Up till now, that was being held back in various countries due to regulatory approval (more on that in a second).</p>\n<p>Garmin has always done regulatory approval in the US first, and thus, the following watches in the US already have ECG (and some other countries that basically mirror the FDA approvals, including Taiwan, Singapore, and Indonesia. The <a href=\"https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=XW4TwGAinJ2juGDNiANMt8\">full list of available countries is here.</a>):</p>\n<p>– Garmin Enduro 3<br />\n– Garmin Epix Pro series<br />\n– Garmin D2 Mach 1 Pro<br />\n– Garmin Fenix 7 Pro series, Fenix 8 Series<br />\n– Garmin Quatix 7 Pro<br />\n– Garmin Tactix 7 Pro AMOLED<br />\n– Garmin Venu 2 Plus (with Gen4 sensor and added hardware but ECG), Venu 3</p>\n<p>In any case, the exclusion of the Fenix 7 Pro &amp; Epix Pro in the EU is peculiar because:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>A) Garmin certifies these as medical devices not based on hardware names (e.g. Fenix 8), but based on a combination of sensor + the ECG App on the device.</strong> This is known as Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), and allows companies like Apple/Garmin/Fitbit/Samsung/etc… to certify a specific component, rather than the entire watch as a medical device.</p>\n<p><strong>B) Garmin has already released the ECG feature in the US</strong> + other Asian countries on the  Fenix 7 Pro &amp; Epix Pro, demonstrating it’s perfectly capable</p>\n<p><strong>C) The Venu 3 did get an enabled in the EU/Australia</strong>, presumably because there’s no Venu 4 yet, and thus nothing to upsell. Whereas for the Fenix/Epix, I presume they want you to buy the Fenix 8 instead. Thus demonstrating that this is merely a backend toggle, and not a true certification issue.</p>\n<p><strong>D) Garmin specifically refers to it as the ‘ECG App’</strong>, which is the correct nomeculture. That’s how it’s certified. It is not certified on a per-device naming basis.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I asked Garmin for official comment on why they aren’t enabling the feature in the EU for Fenix 7/Epix owners, and here was the official response:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“<i>The ECG app is a medical device that requires regulatory approval to place on the European Union market. Garmin has made the ECG app available in the European Union for select smartwatches in-line with the necessary regulatory approvals.<strong> </strong>Garmin intends to continue to expand its portfolio of products supporting the ECG app over time.”</i></p></blockquote>\n<p>This is one of the more baffling decisions I’ve seen in recent times from Garmin. And that’s saying something, given there’s been a lot of baffling decisions lately. In fact, I’d even argue Garmin over the last 4-6 months seems to be shifting against supporting existing buyers of products with new features. We saw that with the Fenix 8 release (and no new features for Fenix 7/7 Pro users), we saw that with the Instinct 3 release (and no new features for Instinct 2/2X users). However, some products like the Garmin Edge series continue to do a good job of supporting in-market products with new features.</p>\n<p>Still, this seems cyclical. Years ago Garmin heavily leaned towards the ‘no upgrades’ model, yet was forced by the market (Wahoo on the bike computer side, Apple, Suunto, and COROS on the watch side), to change with the times and provide meaningful upgrades. After all, the Fenix 7 Pro &amp; Epix Pro are barely 18 months old. Certainly, those at Garmin remember what happened last time they did this, right? Competitors came in and took their sales. And more critically, they unnecessarily angered customers. This seems like one of those things that only serves to piss people off. But maybe that’s just me.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting Started:</strong></p>\n<p>In any event, assuming you have a Fenix 8 or Venu 3, I’ve previously <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/10/garmin-ecg-feature-how-to-guide.html\">written how to get started on the ECG capability</a>, which only takes a minute or two and is pretty easy/straightforward. I just activated it on a Fenix 8 here in Spain in about 90 seconds. As a general rule, you need to activate the feature in one of the countries listed/linked above, but then can use ECG in any country after that point. For example, previously I had activated ECG on watches in the US, and then travelled back to Europe and used them here without any issue.</p>\n<p>Oh, and if you haven’t updated your watches (or Garmin Connect app) in some time, then definitely do that first, as it is required to enable the feature. All of the above watches support updating via WiFi, so you can simply ensure WiFi is connected/available, and then go into the About menu to update pretty seamlessly</p>\n<p><em>(Also, a reminder that the ECG function is disabled for public firmware beta builds, until usually the last build before it releases. So if you’re on a public beta firmware, it won’t be available.)</em></p>\n<p>As always, note that the ECG feature (on any watch) does not detect a heart attack, and in Garmin’s case, is doing Afib symptoms detection (when manually started). Garmin is not at this point doing passive Afib detection like some other companies.</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for reading!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"4657bc3bd2db2225c12015e9ed06f82fb61e2ec79e268c0cf726521e3cf2d821","category":"Cycling"}
