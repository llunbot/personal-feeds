Enough to torrent a 75GB package from a Russian site? Enough to not only unpack and play it, but connect to a server and start building up your character?</p>\n<p>Me neither, but that hasn't stopped seemingly hundreds of people from doing just that. Publisher Focus Entertainment had announced the third-person action game having \"gone gold\" (released for manufacturing) <a href=\"https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1810722430144631112\">on July 9</a>. The leaked build might date to February 23, 2024, as <a href=\"https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/\">suggested by site Insider Gaming</a>, which had <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240715211516/https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/\">previously suggested a June 20 date</a>.</p>\n<p>Footage from the leaked builds, which has been mostly taken offline by Focus through copyright claims, suggested that it was a mostly complete version of the game, with some placeholder assets in menus. Said footage also suggests that the game's pirates are playing online, and their characters are retaining their levels and items. For now, at least.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037313#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037313&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"65fdd69d3c1a5a4e6f2039ad565e49fa8e70c0c1e5f273892b3dd026a8a0c88c","category":"Tech"}
