The company brought another beige case to the Computex trade show this week, the vertically oriented FLP02 (<a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/pc-cases/silverstone-reveals-the-flp02-late-80s-style-tower-pc-case-proudly-beige-but-thoroughly-modern-inside\">via Tom's Hardware</a>).</p>\n<p>If the original horizontally oriented FLP01 case called to mind <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq_Deskpro_386#/media/File:DeskPro_386S.jpg\">a 386-era Compaq Deskpro</a>, the FLP02 is a dead ringer for the kind of case you might have gotten for a generic 486 or early Pentium-era PC. That extends to having <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_button\">a Turbo button</a> built into the frontâ€”on vintage PCs, this button could actually determine how fast the processor was allowed to run, though here, it's actually a fan speed control instead. A lock on the front also locks the power switch in place to keep it from being flipped off accidentally, something else real vintage PCs actually did.</p>\n<p>Despite its retro facade, the FLP02 is capable of fitting in even higher-end modern PC parts than the original FLP01. Front USB-A and USB-C ports are hidden behind a magnetic door on the front of the case, and its faux-5.25-inch floppy drives are just covers for drive bays that you could use for an optical drive or extra front I/O.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/return-of-the-turbo-button-silverstone-is-making-another-80s-style-beige-pc-case/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/return-of-the-turbo-button-silverstone-is-making-another-80s-style-beige-pc-case/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"36081468bb5d79a397ee3bbdc8ad7be7a57cb359e6b14704fbfaaba0da742cc7","category":"Tech"}
