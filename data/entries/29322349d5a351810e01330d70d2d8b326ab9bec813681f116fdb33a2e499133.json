Since then, nearly half of all iOS devices worldwide have at least version 14.5 installed, according to <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/ios-version-market-share/mobile-tablet/worldwide\">Statcounter</a>, and a vast majority of these devices' users have chosen to deny Facebook and other apps the ability to track them. Nearly three months after the feature's launch, just 17 percent of users worldwide have opted in, according to analytics company <a href=\"https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-idfa-app-tracking-transparency-weekly/\">Flurry</a>.</p>\n<p>The changes could have a significant effect on Facebook’s bottom line. Eric Seufert, an analyst who writes Mobile Dev Memo, forecasts that if only 20 percent of users consent to tracking, Facebook’s revenue could <a href=\"https://mobiledevmemo.com/facebook-may-take-revenue-hit-from-apple-privacy-changes/\">drop 7 percent</a> in the first full quarter that the opt-in prompt is active (the forthcoming third quarter). The company warned <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/ios-14-privacy-settings-will-tank-ad-targeting-business-facebook-warns/\">back in February</a> that the iOS changes would curtail its ability to track users across the Internet.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780563#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780563&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"29322349d5a351810e01330d70d2d8b326ab9bec813681f116fdb33a2e499133","category":"Tech"}
