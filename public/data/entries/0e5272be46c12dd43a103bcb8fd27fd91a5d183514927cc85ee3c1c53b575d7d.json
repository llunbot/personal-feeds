The shape is said to create an “expanded fit range” to accommodate a wider variety of foot shapes and sizes, possibly reducing the chance of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/cycling-foot-pain/\">foot pain</a>.</p>\n<p>Shimano says this was made possible by a new heel cup, which is claimed to be stabilising and ‘anti-twist’ to hold your foot in place during hard efforts – and presumably, the outlays of power we can expect to see animate races such as the Tour of Flanders.</p>\n<h2>Weights and sizes</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The shoe weighs a claimed 225g in a size EU42.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano</i></span></div>\n<p>The Shimano RC903S comes in sizes EU37 to 47, with half sizes available, as well as in sizes EU36 and 48.</p>\n<p>There is a wide-fit version of the shoe across the same sizes as the standard version.</p>\n<p>The shoe weighs a claimed 225g in a size EU42.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"0e5272be46c12dd43a103bcb8fd27fd91a5d183514927cc85ee3c1c53b575d7d","category":"Cycling"}
