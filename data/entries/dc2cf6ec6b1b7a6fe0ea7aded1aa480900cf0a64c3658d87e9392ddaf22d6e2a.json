While the name change was prevalent in several rumors from influential sources like Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> in late 2022 and early 2023, the idea has since faded and emphasis has shifted to Apple releasing such a model as a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/05/gurman-new-top-of-the-line-iphone/\">new high-end device next year</a> instead. Now, <em>AppleInsider</em>'s Andrew O'Hara claims that the \"‌iPhone 15‌ Ultra\" name is back:<div><blockquote><p>Here’s a late Friday tidbit I’ve heard for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhone15?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#iPhone15</a>. Multiple sources have told me Apple will indeed use the “iPhone 15 Ultra” monicker for the plus-sized pro phone. This was an early rumor that got backpedaled. Most have since referred to it as iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p>— Andrew O'Hara (@Andrew_OSU) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Andrew_OSU/status/1692702380456853619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nO'Hara does not have much of a track record for Apple rumors, but he did share <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/03/airpods-pro-2-charging-case-renders/\">accurate renders</a> of the second-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> before they launched last year. With its larger display, longer battery life, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-15-pro-max-periscope-rumored-again/\">periscope telephoto camera</a> with 6x optical zoom, the top-tier <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> could justify the \"Ultra\" moniker.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's naming choices are subject to change throughout a product's development process, often explaining why new devices are titled differently to what rumors have come to suggest. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a> were largely expected to be called the \"AirPods Studio.\" Most recently, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a> was widely expected to be called \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xros/\">xrOS</a>.\" The rumored name was found littered throughout Apple's materials following WWDC, indicating that ‌visionOS‌ was a last-minute switch. Whether Apple will change the name of its \"Pro Max\" model this year is unknown, but the idea was likely under consideration at minimum and could still be on the table.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-ultra-could-replace-pro-max/\">'iPhone 15 Ultra' Could Still Replace 'Pro Max' Model This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-ultra-could-still-replace-pro-max-model-this-year.2399215/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dc2cf6ec6b1b7a6fe0ea7aded1aa480900cf0a64c3658d87e9392ddaf22d6e2a","category":"Apple"}
