A new algorithm analyses structures, resharpens, and adjusts shadows. The color science of ‌Night Mode‌ will also be \"visibly\" improved.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Weinbach, Apple's third-generation ‌AirPods‌ will feature a charging case with a 20 percent larger battery compared to the second-generation ‌AirPods‌, but will offer wireless charging as standard. The batteries inside each individual AirPod will also be around the same size as previous models. The sound quality is said to be largely the same as the second-generation ‌AirPods‌, but with slightly improved bass and low-end.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWeinbach added that the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ is set to see the Apple Watch's biggest improvement in battery life yet.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt is worth noting that Weinbach has a mixed to poor track record. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/29/iphone-12-pro-max-4k-video-120fps-240fps/\">Previous reports</a> from Weinbach are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/17/iphone-12-pro-max-cad-leak-slimmer-design/\">littered with large numbers of claims</a> that never panned out, such as the insistence that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/10/iphone-12-120hz-promotion-3x-camera-face-id/\">the iPhone 12 would feature</a> a 120Hz display, bigger batteries, improved Face ID, and improved optical zoom. There have also been incorrect rumors about a native <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> Calculator app in iOS 13, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mweinbachXDA/status/1096486249861431296\">iPhone displays that work under water</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mweinbachXDA/status/1099324061425881088\">Dark Mode being delayed</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> launch in Austria and Italy within 2019, to name a few.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLast year, directly ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> event, Weinbach issued a wave of detailed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/11/iphone-12-faster-face-id-improved-zoom/\">\"leaks\" about the iPhone 12 lineup</a> that were similar to this thread. Virtually none of the rumors from the equivalent tweet thread last year came true. Despite these ultimately incorrect rumors, Weinbach <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/22/navy-blue-iphone-12-color-rumor/\">correctly predicted</a> that the ‌iPhone 12‌ would feature a new blue color option last year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWeinbach has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-always-on-display-stronger-magesafe/\">vocal about what can be expected</a> from the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup, contributing to three <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/26/iphone-13-matt-black-stainless-steel-coating/\">detailed reports</a> from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/04/iphone-13-larger-wireless-charging-coil/\">over the last year</a>. Indeed, many of the more popular rumors around the upcoming devices have come from Weinbach, such as astrophotography features, an always-on display, stronger <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> magnets, a matte black color option and a potential bronze color option, an anti-fingerprint coating, and reverse wireless charging. It is yet to be seen if his rumors will come to fruition this year at Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2021-event/\">\"California Streaming\" special event</a> on Tuesday, September 14.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/max-weinbach/\">Max Weinbach</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/\">AirPods 3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-7/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/08/leaker-details-last-minute-iphone-13-rumors/\">Leaker Details Last-Minute iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, and AirPods 3 Rumors</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leaker-details-last-minute-iphone-13-apple-watch-series-7-and-airpods-3-rumors.2310066/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1d0pRJSoESM:iAL_6M36YZM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1d0pRJSoESM:iAL_6M36YZM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/1d0pRJSoESM\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3a2d7053095c610ff99b24d0c7698cddeb14def278d72705b5b62bdb7bb4d2f5","category":"Apple"}
