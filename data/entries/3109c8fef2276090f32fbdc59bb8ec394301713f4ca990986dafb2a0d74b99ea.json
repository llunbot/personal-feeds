From there, Shane’s love of cycling only grew, and today he not only rides bikes and competes in triathlon, he’s founded his own sportswear kit brand, AGILIS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shane talks about training, winning, the difficulties of life after pro sport, and how he came to cycling. And most importantly answers that question: how many watts can a superstar rugby player push on a bike?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact AGILIS to find out about its bespoke kit design service for clubs and charity events and check out <a href=\"https://www.agilissport.com/\" target=\"_blank\">agilissport.com</a> for the full range, from jerseys to bib shorts to gilets – and enter CYCLISTMAG20 at the checkout for 20% off your order. </p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes/100-shane-williams-welsh-rugby-legend-turned-cyclist-and-agi\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 100 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/daniel-troia-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 99: Daniel Troia cycled across America with no food or money</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/david-kinjah-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 98: African cycling pioneer David Kinjah, the man who made Chris Froome</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/alix-popham-dementia\">‘I don’t remember meeting Nelson Mandela’</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/i-don-t-tend-to-break-frames-so-much-as-wheels-martin-johnson-qa\">‘I don’t tend to break frames so much as wheels’: Martin Johnson Q&amp;A</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Did you know Cyclist is also a stunning monthly magazine?
