It’s one of the most iconic and influential tech gadgets of all time, and everyone wants to know what’s coming next. That Apple is so secretive only heightens the appeal of iPhone rumors and leaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it should come as little surprise that iPhone 17 rumors, leaks, and info started to circulate months before the iPhone 16 was even formally announced. Here’s everything we know so far, but don’t take any of it as solid info: even when early rumors are accurate, plans can change, and nothing is ever certain until Apple announces it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s something we do know: The new iPhone lineup is almost always announced in September—usually on a Tuesday in the second week of September, to be specific. So we would expect the iPhone 17 line to be announced on or around September 9, 2025. Here’s when the most recent models were released:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 15:</strong> September 12, 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 14: </strong>Sepember 7, 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 13:</strong> Sepember 14, 2021</li>\n\n\n\n<li>i<strong>Phone 12:</strong> October 13, 2020 (delayed due to Covid)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, preorders for the iPhone begin on the Friday after the announcement, and the phones ship a week later. On occasion, some specific models may ship a couple of weeks later than the others due to production issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t yet heard if the iPhone 17 line will cost the same as the iPhone 16 line, which at this time hasn’t even been announced yet. Since Apple already increased the price of the Pro Max this year, we expect pricing for the iPhone 17 to remain similar to that of the iPhone 15 line:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 15:</strong> $799/£749</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 15 Plus:</strong> $899/£899</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro:</strong> $999/£999</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max: </strong>$1,199/£1,199</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, some rumors suggest that Apple will release a new higher-end model that could have a higher price tag than the iPhone Pro Max. However, we still expect the existing models to keep the same pricing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Colors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t yet heard anything about what colors to expect from the iPhone 17 line. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2301253/2024-iphone-colors-iphone-16-plus-pro-max-purple-yellow-gold-space-gray.html\">iPhone 16 is expected to launch</a> in seven colors, with white and purple joining blue, pink, yellow, green, and black. Additionally, desert yellow and cement gray are expected which are reportedly reminiscent of the classic gold and space gray options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t heard any rumors about the iPhone 17’s colors and probably won’t until after the iPhone 16 launches.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPad Air M2 vs Pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4032w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>The iPhone 17 is expected to have an ultra-thin model liket he M4 iPad Pro.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPad Air M2 vs Pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4032w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The iPhone 17 is expected to have an ultra-thin model liket he M4 iPad Pro.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Petter Ahrnstedt</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPad Air M2 vs Pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4032w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The iPhone 17 is expected to have an ultra-thin model liket he M4 iPad Pro.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Petter Ahrnstedt</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Petter Ahrnstedt</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: New ‘Slim’ model</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been rumored for years that Apple is planning to launch a new model with higher-end features above the Pro Max. It looks like it may finally arrive in 2025. Several analysts have reported that the existing Plus model will be replaced by a <strong>new “Slim” model</strong> with a larger screen size and a much thinner body. Analyst Jeff Pu was the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2324602/iphone-17-slim-24mp-front-camera-2025.html\">first to report this change</a>, and The Information later <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2337606/the-2025-iphone-could-feature-a-thin-redesigned-ultra-high-end-model.html\">reported on the Slim model</a>, stating that it would be a new even-higher-end model that sits above “Pro Max” in the lineup and would have a centered rear camera and a smaller Dynamic Island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple jumped back on the thin train with the launch of the M4 iPad Pro in May. It’s also rumored that Apple will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369453/ipad-pro-thin-design-iphone-macbook-apple-watch.html\">launch a thinner Apple Watch and MacBook Pro</a> over the coming months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Rumored new features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All iPhone 17 models have been rumored to feature a <strong>24MP front-facing camera</strong> and the <strong>always-on display</strong> is supposed to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2251596/report-claims-the-iphone-17-will-finally-get-an-always-on-display.html\">finally be available on the non-Pro models</a>. Some believe that ProMotion will come to the non-Pro models too, since the same LPTO technology that enables the always-on display is what makes ProMotion possible, in Apple’s iPhone implementation. If true, it would be the first time Apple has offered ProMotion on a non-Pro device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is also <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2270684/iphone-17-anti-glare-scratch-resistant-display.html\">said to be working with Corning</a> on a <strong>new anti-glare and scratch-resistant glass</strong> for the iPhone 17 lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t know much about what chips will power the iPhone 17 line, but thanks to the demands of Apple Intelligence we can expect every model to have at least 8GB of RAM. The high-end models will get an A19 Pro, while the non-Pro models will get either some variant of the A18 or a somewhat cut-back version of the A19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to wireless, the cellular modem is likely to still be supplied by Qualcomm; Apple’s own efforts to produce a top-tier 5G modem seem to be stalled and likely won’t be ready in time for next year’s iPhone 17 line. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/828757/wi-fi-7-speed-latency-apple-devices.html\">Wi-Fi 7 support</a> seems likely, too.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3efe770467a86fa84a1b5410a6a2f6a2070ca175eb4ae81b96e334152458eb2e","category":"Apple"}
