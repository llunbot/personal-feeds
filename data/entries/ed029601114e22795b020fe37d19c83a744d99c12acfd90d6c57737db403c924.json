What’s unusual is how they’re building it — by bolting together giant beams, columns, and panels made of manufactured slabs of wood.</p>\n<p>As each wood element is delivered by flatbed, a tall crane lifts it into place and holds it in position while workers attach it with metal connectors. In its half-finished state, the building resembles flat-pack furniture in the process of being assembled.</p>\n<p>The tower uses a new technology called mass timber. In this kind of construction, massive, manufactured wood elements that can extend more than half the length of a football field replace steel beams and concrete.
