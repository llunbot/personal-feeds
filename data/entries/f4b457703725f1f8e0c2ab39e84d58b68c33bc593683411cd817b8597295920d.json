When the first iteration launched in 2016, it featured a chunky build and mediocre specs. Since then, Apple has actively developed its wireless earbuds, introducing multiple tiers, more compact designs, longer battery life, and advanced integration with the wider Apple ecosystem. Today, customers can pick from models that start at $129 and go all the way up to $549—catering to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/541154/apple-deals.html\">different budgets</a> and expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1207444/airpods-pro-2-review-2.html\">AirPods Pro 2</a> happen to be my favorite model. They’re the perfect balance between portability and immersion, offering support for ANC and Dolby Atmos in a miniature shell. And they get regular boosts from software updates, such as the recently introduced hearing health features. Nevertheless, there are some shortcomings that I’d like to see Apple address when it launches the AirPods Pro 3, likely in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the seven upgrades I hope we’ll see from the next version of the AirPods Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Actual Intelligence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In an era dominated by AI, the world’s most valuable tech firm still <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2643682/is-siri-really-that-bad-yes-yes-it-is.html\">struggles</a> to deliver a reliable personal assistant. With this in mind, Apple baked ChatGPT into iOS 18, improving users’ experience until it figures out how to fix Siri. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I can instruct Siri to ask ChatGPT a question using my AirPods Pro 2, the task fails most of the time. It either asks OpenAI’s chatbot an entirely different question or ignores my explicit ChatGPT request and offers generic web results. Curiously, I only encounter this issue when summoning Siri with my AirPods—the ChatGPT integration works just fine when initiating it from my iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the AirPods Pro 3, I want Apple to integrate ChatGPT’s voice mode, letting users start real-time audio conversations through their earbuds. Google’s Pixel Buds already offer a similar Gemini Live experience, which enables users to inquire about more complex matters using natural language. My iPhone’s Action button is currently set to start a ChatGPT voice mode session, but that requires me to take my phone out and unlock it when on the go.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Action-button-translator.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone Action button translator\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Action-button-translator.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Action-button-translator.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Action-button-translator.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Action-button-translator.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Action-button-translator.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Action-button-translator.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Action-button-translator.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iPhone-Action-button-translator.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Live translation is a hugely valuable feature that would elevate the AirPods Pro.</figcaption></figure><p>Mahmoud Itani / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Automatic translation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another handy Google Pixel Buds capability is live translation, and I’d love to see it on the AirPods Pro 3. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past five years, I’ve been moving between countries where English isn’t widely spoken or a viable lingua franca. While the Translate app offers an Action button shortcut and can handle the task, communicating directly via the earbuds would be more intuitive outdoors. Fortunately, rumors suggest that iOS 19 will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2636989/airpods-to-get-live-translation-feature-as-part-of-ios-19-update.html\">adopt such a feature</a>, so we could see it when the next AirPods launch in the fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Shifting to the dark side</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Pro 3 are rumored to rock a shrunken look that does away with the stem. But while I always find design overhauls exciting, size isn’t the only aspect that matters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since their initial debut, all AirPods and AirPods Pro models have exclusively come in white. With the next-gen release, I hope Apple puts out a black variant for those averse to light-colored gadgets. After all, the Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard have already adopted this formula.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3795220/apple_imac_pro_review12.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iMac Pro\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Black products and accessories are cool, as the iMac Pro demonstrated.</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Amplified noise cancellation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Active noise cancellation is one of my most treasured AirPods Pro 2 perks, letting me shut out the world when in public spaces. While the feature efficiently blocks out most external distractions, loud noise still manages to slip through. With the next AirPods Pro iteration, it would be great if we could get a stronger ANC that muffles more sounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Sensing the beat</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2601169/powerbeats-pro-2-review.html\">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> were the first Apple audio product to incorporate a heart rate sensor, and the AirPods Pro 3 could and should follow suit. But it should also take the feature further. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, the Beats-branded earbuds come with a ton of restrictions that dictate how users can measure their heart rate. For example, only a handful of fitness apps, excluding Apple’s own, support the monitor. Also, there’s no option to pick a default heart rate monitoring accessory when wearing an Apple Watch and Powerbeats Pro 2 simultaneously. With the AirPods Pro 3, I wish Apple would address these limitations so users can rely on the technology when using Fitness+ and pick which wearable records the data.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-heart-rate.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch displaying heart rate\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-heart-rate.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-heart-rate.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-heart-rate.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-heart-rate.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-heart-rate.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-heart-rate.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-heart-rate.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-heart-rate.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>The Apple Watch can monitor your heart; why can’t the AirPods Pro?</figcaption></figure><p>Mahmoud Itani / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. One-tap firmware updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a tech enthusiast, you’re likely familiar with the AirPods software update process (or lack thereof). Apple specifies that you can update your earbuds’ firmware by bringing them close to your iDevice and connecting them to a power source. The process, however, occurs randomly in the background, with seemingly no way to force it or monitor its progress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575705/ios-19-features-release-date-beta.html\">iOS 19</a> and the AirPods Pro 3 launch this fall, I wish Apple would add a dedicated button in the Settings app to easily check for, download, and install the latest firmware available. This would make it more convenient for devoted users to try new features the moment they debut.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. More life per charge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I dislike about my AirPods Pro 2 is their battery life. According to Apple, the earbuds can last 5-6 hours on a single charge with ANC enabled. That’s significantly shorter than a full work shift or hiking session, often forcing me to pause my music and recharge. The Powerbeats Pro 2, on the other hand, offer up to 8 hours of listening time with ANC on. A similar battery life on the next AirPods Pro would be ideal.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"AirPods Pro 2 next to iPhone 16 Pro Max\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-iPhone-16-Pro-Max.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Surely we can do better than 5-6 hours on a single charge, Apple?</figcaption></figure><p>Mahmoud Itani / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Pro device that lives up to its name</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Pro 2 are already one of my most-used Apple products. Whether I’m running in the city, hiking in the middle of nowhere, working from a café, or just commuting, the earbuds keep me entertained by minimizing external noise and delivering spatial audio tracks. Despite that, Apple could enhance them further by addressing the imperfections above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Pro 3 need to catch up with the times and bring smarter features, AI-powered and otherwise. With competing brands also offering multiple colorways, a new finish would make the AirPods more enticing to a certain category of customers. That’s not to mention the other quality-of-life tweaks that would only make using the product more seamless. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, we should find out what’s in store for us in just four months.
