Real-life pictures of the \"Pixel 9 Pro\" model have landed over at <a href=\"https://rozetked.me/news/33143-eksklyuziv-zhivye-foto-google-pixel-9-pro-ot-rozetked\">Rozetked</a>.</p>\n<p>This prototype looks <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/googles-pixel-9-gets-its-first-leaked-render-looks-a-lot-like-an-iphone/\">just like</a> the renders from OnLeaks that first came out back in January. The biggest change is a new pill-shaped camera bump instead of the edge-to-edge design of old models. It looks rather stylish in real-life photos, with the rounded corners of the pill and camera glass matching the body shape. The matte back looks like it still uses the excellent \"soft-touch glass\" material from last year. The front and back of the phone are totally flat, with a metal band around the side. The top edge still has a signal window cut out of it, which is usually for mmWave. The Pixel 8 Pro's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2024/01/pixel-8-pro-finally-gets-forehead-scanning-body-temperature-feature/\">near-useless</a> temperature sensor appears to still be on the back of this prototype. At least, the spot for the temperature sensor—the silver disk right below the LED camera flash—looks identical to the Pixel 8 Pro. As a prototype any of this could change before the final release, but this is what it looks like right now.</p>\n<p>The phone was helpfully photographed next to an iPhone 14 Pro Max, and you might notice that the Pixel 9 Pro looks a little small! That's because this <em>is</em> one of the small models, with only a 6.1-inch display. Previously for Pixels, \"Pro\" meant \"the big model,\" but this year Google is supposedly shipping three models, adding in a top-tier small phone. There's the usual big Pixel 9, with a 6.7-inch display, which will reportedly be called the \"Pixel 9 Pro XL.\" The new model is the \"Pixel 9 Pro\"—no XL—which is a small model but still with all the \"Pro\" trimmings, like three rear cameras. There's also the Pixel 9 base model, which is the usual smaller phone (6.03-inch) with cut-down specs like only two rear cameras.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019066#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019066&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aca940dea126e3aef6f6e50f2dc47d433a2b4efe61d7a31fb9641c2ac78f0b7b","category":"Tech"}
