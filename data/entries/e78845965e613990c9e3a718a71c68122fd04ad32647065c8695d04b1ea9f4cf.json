The article did really well—thanks for reading it!—but one thing commenters pointed out was that my preferred dhcpd implementation, the venerable isc-dhcp-server, <a href=\"https://www.isc.org/dhcp/\">reached end-of-life in 2022</a>. To replace it, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Systems_Consortium\">ISC</a> has for many years been working on the development of a new DHCP server named <a href=\"https://www.isc.org/kea/\">Kea</a>.</p>\n<p>Kea (which for this piece will refer mainly to the isc-kea-dhcp4 and isc-kea-dhcp-ddns applications) doesn't alter the end-user experience of receiving DHCP addresses—your devices won't much care if you're using isc-dhcp-server or isc-kea-dhcp4. Instead, what Kea brings to the table is a new codebase that jettisons the older dhcpd's multi-decade pile of often crufty code for a new pile of much less crufty code that will (hopefully) be easier to maintain and extend.</p>\n<p>Many Ars readers are aware of the classic Joel on Software blog post about how rewriting your application from scratch <a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/\">is almost never a good idea</a>, but something like isc-dhcp-server—whose redesign is being handled planfully by the Internet Systems Consortium—is the exception to the rule.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/finally-upgrading-from-isc-dhcp-server-to-isc-kea-for-my-homelab/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/finally-upgrading-from-isc-dhcp-server-to-isc-kea-for-my-homelab/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Lee Hutchinson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e78845965e613990c9e3a718a71c68122fd04ad32647065c8695d04b1ea9f4cf","category":"Tech"}
