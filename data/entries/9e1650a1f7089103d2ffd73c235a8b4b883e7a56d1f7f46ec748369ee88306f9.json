Now, that's coming to an end, as WhatsApp has officially announced that it will easily allow users to transfer their chats between Android and iOS.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs reported first by <em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-import-chat-history-android-ios-144745811.html\">Engadget</a></em>, WhatsApp used airtime during Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event to announce the new feature. WhatsApp tested the feature for the past few weeks and said it was difficult to implement due to \"end-to-end encryption,\" requiring added assistance to make it work. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe feature will first arrive on Android devices, specifically Samsung smartphones, allowing users to initially transfer chats from iOS to Samsung smartphones. The transfer will include the chat itself, photos, videos, and voice memos, and should be available to Samsung users in the \"coming weeks.\" WhatsApp has not said when the feature will arrive for a wider range of WhatsApp devices and on iOS. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/11/whatsapp-transfer-between-android-ios/\">WhatsApp Rolling Out Ability to Transfer Chats Between iOS and Android</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-rolling-out-ability-to-transfer-chats-between-ios-and-android.2307228/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AnXJklx7v_A:7UKE73TQhmU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AnXJklx7v_A:7UKE73TQhmU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/AnXJklx7v_A\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9e1650a1f7089103d2ffd73c235a8b4b883e7a56d1f7f46ec748369ee88306f9","category":"Apple"}
