But the newer Anti-Lag+ system—which was <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2078814/amd-adrenalin-23-9-2-less-lag-in-starfield-with-new-driver.html\">first rolled out for a handful of games last month</a>—updates this system by \"applying frame alignment within the game code itself,\" according to AMD. That method leads to additional lag reduction of up to 10 ms, according to AMD's data.</p>\n<p>That additional lag reduction could offer players a bit of a competitive advantage in these games (with the usual arguments about whether that advantage is \"unfair\" or not). But it's Anti-Lag+'s particular method of altering the \"game code itself\" that sets off warning bells for the Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) system. After AMD added Anti-Lag+ support for <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231011201543/https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-23-10-1\">a version 23.10.1 update last week</a>, VAC started issuing bans to unsuspecting AMD users that activated the feature.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976235#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976235&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"703d095434bef80ce7cca94e16ed836a22b7491aa7e2efbd4a774d08b682d839","category":"Tech"}
