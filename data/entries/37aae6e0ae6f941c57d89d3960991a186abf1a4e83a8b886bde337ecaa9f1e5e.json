{"title":"Andy Allen on the App Store’s Feature Stagnation","link":"https://www.threads.com/@asallen/post/DJPLWZ-NwPZ","date":1747344267000,"content":"\n<p>Andy Allen, of <a href=\"https://notbor.ing/\">Not Boring Software</a>, last week on Threads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While the focus on the App Store injunction has been mostly on the\ncommission rate, what’s been overlooked is just how far the tools\nof the App Store have fallen behind.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a long and growing list of features common on most payment\nand subscription service providers that still aren’t possible on\nthe App Store today. Price testing, refunds, managing\nsubscriptions, plan migrations, gifting, discount codes,\nsubscription bundles — to name just a few. Entire businesses have\nspawned just to fill these critical gaps. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Apple has always been one to embrace competition. It’s a\nbattlefield where they’ve historically done very well. They’ve\nnever been afraid to step into a crowded market with their intense\nfocus on design and user experience to show us how insanely great\nsomething can be when you truly care.</p>\n\n<p>More than anything, I hope this moment reignites that\ncompetitive spirit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s kind of bananas that it’s 2025 and the App Store still doesn’t allow developers to issue refunds. I’ve had this discussion with numerous developers. They’ll be doing customer support, and <em>want</em> to issue a refund, but explain that they can’t — and users find that so hard to believe they suspect the developer is bullshitting them. But you really do have to <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223\">request a refund from Apple</a>, not from the developer directly, and step 2 of the process is “Wait 24 to 48 hours for an update on your request”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/15/andy-allen-app-store-feature-stagnation\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"37aae6e0ae6f941c57d89d3960991a186abf1a4e83a8b886bde337ecaa9f1e5e","category":"Tech"}
