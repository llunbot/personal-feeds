The Plate Absorber Tech – new Hydroformed edition (PAT.H), is not quite as flat as in carbon. But Titici claims the comfort gains are still a big help, especially over long days in the saddle off-road. Plus, the alloy PAT.H frameset sells for about half of the carbon PAT version in their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/titici-relli-carbon-gravel-bike-adds-arch-absorber-to-ultra-thin-toptube-flexy-comfort-concept/\" target=\"_blank\">Relli</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that bike adds the optional AND finish debuted on the old <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/titici-all-in-and-alloy-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">All-In AND</a> a year earlier. A look that truly sets the bike apart, while also boosting frame protection. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>GHA Silver Ano – Tech Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_integrated-internal-routing.jpg\" alt=\"Titici Alloi AND aluminum gravel bike with GHA Silver hard anodized finish, integrated internal cable routing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_integrated-internal-routing.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_integrated-internal-routing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_integrated-internal-routing-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_integrated-internal-routing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_integrated-internal-routing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_integrated-internal-routing-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_integrated-internal-routing-720x480.jpg 720w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Titici Alloi AND aluminum gravel bike with GHA Silver hard anodized finish, integrated internal cable routing\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Titici Alloi AND aluminum gravel bike with GHA Silver hard anodized finish, integrated internal cable routing\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Developed with alloy tubing supplier Dedacciai, the purpose of the GHA (Golden Hard Anodizing) process is actually to better protect the aluminum frame – both inside and out. The name is a bit confusing reflecting the final coloring. But the process works by integrating a protective oxide layer of silver ions onto the porous surface of the aluminum tubes. Delivering “almost infinite durability”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is increased hardness &amp; resistance to wear, but also a lower friction surface, and high antibacterial &amp; anti-mold performance. That’s why GHA has long been in use for marine &amp; pharmaceutical industries. Titici says they have an exclusive partnership with the Japanese creators of the technology, making this the only GHA bike you can get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumor has it, that mud &amp; dirt are noticeably easier to wipe right off after a ride. Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\"

Titici says this new generation of Alloi AND gravel frames now has room for up to 700 x 45mm or 650 x 50mm tires. No word on what exact changes were made. But a quick look at new and old frames suggests a likely subtle chainstay tweak to squeeze an extra 5mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bonus good news, the tire clearance upgrade also applies to the standard painted Alloi this year, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Alloi Bike Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_rear-dropout-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Titici Alloi AND aluminum gravel bike with GHA Silver hard anodized finish, driveside dropout\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_rear-dropout-detail.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_rear-dropout-detail-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_rear-dropout-detail-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_rear-dropout-detail-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_rear-dropout-detail-768x768.jpg 768w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Titici Alloi AND aluminum gravel bike with GHA Silver hard anodized finish, driveside dropout\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Titici Alloi AND aluminum gravel bike with GHA Silver hard anodized finish, driveside dropout\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_flat-mount-disc-brake-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Titici Alloi AND aluminum gravel bike with GHA Silver hard anodized finish, flat mount dic brakes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_flat-mount-disc-brake-detail.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_flat-mount-disc-brake-detail-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_flat-mount-disc-brake-detail-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_flat-mount-disc-brake-detail-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Titici-Alloi-AND-comfy-aluminum-gravel-bike-with-GHA-Silver-hard-anodized-finish_flat-mount-disc-brake-detail-768x768.jpg 768w\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t        <div>\n                \n                    \n                \n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Titici Alloi AND aluminum gravel bike with GHA Silver hard anodized finish, flat mount dic brakes\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div>\n<figure><img alt=\"Titici Alloi AND aluminum gravel bike with GHA Silver hard anodized finish, flat mount dic brakes\" /></figure>\n</div>\n                <div></div>\n        </div></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Briefly, the Titici Alloi is a 1690g 7000-series Dedacciai aluminum gravel frame with fully internal cable routing through a 1.5″ Deda DCR headset system, a threaded BSA BB, 31.6mm seatpost, flat mount disc &amp; 12mm thru-axles.
