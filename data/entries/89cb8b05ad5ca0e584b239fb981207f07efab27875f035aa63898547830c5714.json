A close look at the final kilometres, though, reveals a significant sting in the tail.</p>\n<p><span>Cullera this year returns to La Vuelta to host a stage finish for only the second time — it staged the conclusion to stage 2 in 1980, which was won by Sean Kelly. The day will be defined by the </span><span>Alto de la Montaña de Cullera — a 2km ascent, which is better described as a wall due to its absurd gradients.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/la-vuelta-a-espana-2021-preview\"><b><i>Vuelta 2021 Guide</i></b></a></p>\n<div></div>\n<h4><b>Route</b></h4>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/VE21-Altimetriasv4-6_1024x1024.png?v=1629219105\" />Stage 6 profile</span></i></p>\n<p><span>After the stage begins in Requena, the race heads east towards the Balearic Sea.

This demonstrates just how difficult the ascent is, even though it's short-lived. With this in mind, we can assume that the GC favourites will come to the fore.</span></p>\n<p><span>Considering the characteristics of the Alto de la Montaña,</span><b> Primož Roglič</b><span> begins as the heavy favourite. The Slovenian has demonstrated his ability on short, steep climbs before, notably at La </span><span>Flèche </span><span>Wallonne earlier this season when he came agonisingly close to defeating the seemingly unbeatatable Julian Alaphilippe. Roglič starts the stage 30 seconds behind red jersey holder Rein </span><span>Taaramäe </span><span>— if Roglic does win the stage, it will be difficult for </span><span>Taaramäe to hold on to the </span><i><span>maillot rojo</span></i><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Second to <span>Pogačar </span>at the Volta Comunitat Valenciana last year was </span><b>Alejandro Valverde</b><span>. The climb suits the Spaniard’s qualities — he’s a great puncher with a rapid sprint finish. He demonstrated brilliant legs on </span><span>Picón Blanco</span><span> a couple of days ago to finish with the primary GC favourites, too. </span><b>Enric Mas </b><span>and </span><b>Miguel Ángel López</b><span> also showed strength for Movistar on the first uphill test, but this one looks to be for Valverde.</span></p>\n<p><span>Olympic champion</span><b> Richard Carapaz</b><span> showed signs of weakness on </span><span>Picón Blanco</span><span>, suggesting the Ineos Grenadiers will now turn their focus to </span><b>Adam Yates </b><span>and </span><b>Egan Bernal</b><span>. Both have demonstrated their capability on short climbs before — will they be aggressive or follow the wheels?</span></p>\n<p><span>Bahrain-Victorious took charge on </span><span>Picón Blanco</span><span>, but their GC leader </span><b>Mikel Landa</b><span> decided to act with caution. After the stage, Landa stated, “</span><span>I hadn’t felt confident about today’s stage but I’ve been able to be up there with the best</span><span>.” We can expect Landa to grow into the Vuelta after crashing out of the Giro d’Italia earlier this season. If Landa is positioned well, perhaps Bahrain will allow</span><span> another of their riders to attack. Their best options are</span><span> </span><b>Wout Poels, </b><b>Gino Mäder</b> <span>or </span><b>Jack Haig</b><span>, who was fifth<span> </span>at the Volta Comunitat Valenciana last year.</span></p>\n<p><span>Other GC riders to look out for include </span><b>Romain Bardet, Felix Großschartner </b><span>and </span><b>Giulio Ciccone</b><span>. Outside of the general classification riders, keep an eye on </span><b>Rudy Molard, Tom Pidcock </b><span>and </span><b>Mauri Vansevenant.</b></p>\n<h4><b>Prediction</b></h4>\n<p><span>Although Adam Yates and Alejandro Valverde could pose a challenge, we can’t see past Primož Roglič here. If the breakaway is caught and the stage win is up for grabs, Roglic won’t hesitate to seize the 10 bonus seconds that lie at the finish line. Primož Roglič is our pick to win stage 6 of the Vuelta a España and hold the red jersey at the end of the stage too.</span></p>\n<p><i><span>Cover image: </span></i><i><span>Luis Angel Gomez / ASO</span></i></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"89cb8b05ad5ca0e584b239fb981207f07efab27875f035aa63898547830c5714","category":"Cycling"}
