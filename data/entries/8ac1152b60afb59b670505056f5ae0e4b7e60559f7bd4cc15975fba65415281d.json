These bikes are designed for intermediate and expert-level trail riders. Liv says that the Intrigue X is a “standout performance mid-travel trail bike”. And that it’s “perfect for navigating everything from playful, gravity-fed trails to rugged singletrack.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-full-driveside-e1712623525443.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"829\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-full-driveside-e1712623525443-1536x829.jpg\" alt=\"Liv Intrigue X Advanced and Intrigue X full driveside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-full-driveside-e1712623525443-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-full-driveside-e1712623525443-297x160.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-full-driveside-e1712623525443-120x65.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-full-driveside-e1712623525443-768x415.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-full-driveside-e1712623525443.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>Photos/Liv Cycling)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Key features include mid-travel suspension (150mm front, and 140mm rear), and adjustable geometry. The adjustable geometry is done with both the flip-chip Maestro 3 suspension and the new flip-chip headset. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>More and more women are mountain biking, and this mid-travel trail category is where we saw a huge opportunity for our community</em>,” said Ludi Scholz, Liv’s Global Off-road &amp; Gravel Category Manager. “<em>The Intrigue family has always been about getting more women out onto the trail, progressing their skills, and growing their confidence. With the introduction of the Intrigue X, we are proud to provide a bike that can handle rough terrain, while remaining super agile and efficient. Coupled with customizable geometry, this is the bike that will grow intermediate riders into advanced, advanced into expert, and beyond</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adjustable Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-geo-chart.jpg\"><img width=\"1297\" height=\"791\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-geo-chart.jpg\" alt=\"Liv Intrigue X Advanced and Intrigue X geo chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-geo-chart.jpg 1297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-geo-chart-297x181.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-geo-chart-120x73.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-geo-chart-768x468.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bot the Intrigue X Advanced and Intrigue X boast adjustable geometry. This will allow riders to customize the geo to match the trail, riding style, and rear wheel size. The flip chip Maestro 3 system enables adjustments the the headtube and seat tube angle, as well as bottom bracket height. This is a proprietary tech that was introduced with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/liv-intrigue-lt-advanced-pro-0-with-fox-live-valve-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Intrigue LT range last year</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally the new flip chip – headset offers customizable reach with positions of -5mm (short), 0mm (mid), or +5 (long). These adjustments can improve handling and stability while offering a personalized fit for riders. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Composite Frameset</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-studio-black-e1712623563228.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-studio-black-e1712623563228-1536x788.jpg\" alt=\"Liv Intrigue X Advanced and Intrigue X studio black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-studio-black-e1712623563228-1536x788.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-studio-black-e1712623563228-297x152.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-studio-black-e1712623563228-120x62.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-studio-black-e1712623563228-768x394.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-studio-black-e1712623563228.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Models in the Intrigue X Advanced series feature a lightweight Advanced-grade composite frameset. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Intrigue X series frame is made with ALUXX SL-grade aluminum, which offers “durability and value”. All models will have integrated downtube storage for a convenient solution for tool and snack storage. There will also be a set of frame mounts underneath the top tube for attaching a compact gear bag. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-shralp-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-shralp-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Liv Intrigue X Advanced and Intrigue X shralp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-shralp-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-shralp-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-shralp-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-shralp-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-shralp-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-shralp-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-shralp-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the Intrigue X is equipped with OverDrive, which is Liv’s oversized fork steerer tube technology. It’s designed for precise front-end steering performance and comes spec’d with oversized headset bearings (1-1/2″ lower and 1-1/8″ upper). It also has a tapered steerer tube. This system ensures the ideal balance of steering stiffness and responsiveness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 140mm Maestro rear suspension and 150mm of front suspension, this mid-travel trail bike is built for efficient climbs and smooth, controlled descents. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wheel Configuration</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Intrigue X has different configurations based on size. Frame sizes XS and S are exclusively designed for an MX setup. That means a 29″ wheel up front and a 27.5″ wheel in the rear. This optimizes rear wheel travel and provides a nimble rear end and a fast rolling front end. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frame sizes M and L come with 29″ wheels in the front and the rear. This offers the flexibility to switch to 27.5″ in the rear (sold separately). Being able to switch offers riders the choice between fast and comfortable or quick and agile riding characteristics. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-front-side-studio-e1712623665283.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"803\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-front-side-studio-e1712623665283-1536x803.jpg\" alt=\"Liv Intrigue X Advanced and Intrigue X front side studio\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-front-side-studio-e1712623665283-1536x803.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-front-side-studio-e1712623665283-297x155.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-front-side-studio-e1712623665283-120x63.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-front-side-studio-e1712623665283-768x402.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-front-side-studio-e1712623665283.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Intrigue X Advanced models feature the Giant TRX Whee Systems with carbon rims. While the Intrigue X models come with the Giant TRA Wheel Systems with alloy rims. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these wheel systems are equipped with Wide Guard rim technology. This includes a broad 30mm inner rim width and a robust 5mm sidewall, helping reduce the risk of impact punctures. These wheel systems also allow the rider to run lower tire pressure without the need for heavy tire inserts. This ensures better grip and control on rough, technical terrain.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-in-the-hills-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-in-the-hills-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Liv Intrigue X Advanced and Intrigue X in the hills\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-in-the-hills-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-in-the-hills-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-in-the-hills-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-in-the-hills-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-in-the-hills-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-in-the-hills-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liv-Intrigue-X-Advanced-and-Intrigue-X-in-the-hills-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Some Other Notable Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some other notable additions include internal cable routing and integrated cable ports. This provides a super clean look and smoother performance for derailleur, back, and dropper seat post cables. Both the drive-side chainstay and down tube are equipped with frame protection guarding against rocks and debris. You’ll also find a clear 3M protective strip on the upper part of the downtube. This is there to safeguard the frame during shuttle vehicle transport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All models in the Intrigue X Advanced and Intrigue X series are available in XS, S, M and L</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.liv-cycling.com/global\" target=\"_blank\">Liv-Cycling.com </a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/liv-intrigue-x-mid-travel-trail-bike/\">LIV Launches New Intrigue X Mid-Travel Trail Bike With Flip Chip Headset and Geo Customization</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8ac1152b60afb59b670505056f5ae0e4b7e60559f7bd4cc15975fba65415281d","category":"Cycling"}
