In a paywalled report this week, the supply chain publication said Apple has selected China-based manufacturer Tianma to supply the LCD panels for the device, at an \"exceptionally competitive\" price of $10 per panel. The low cost of this component would likely contribute to the device being more affordable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA screen-equipped HomePod has been rumored several times over the past few years. Earlier this month, for example, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/kuo-homepod-display-coming-late-2025/\">similarly said</a> that a HomePod with a 6-to-7-inch display, an A18 chip, and Apple Intelligence support would enter mass production in the second half of 2025. Kuo said smart home capabilities would be a core aspect of the device, so it sounds like rumors about a screen-equipped HomePod and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-home-command-center-march-2025/\">Apple's rumored smart home hub</a> are referring to the same product coming next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last month said Apple's smart home hub looks like a \"square iPad,\" with a roughly 6-inch screen. He said the hub can be attached to a tabletop base with a speaker, or mounted on a wall. It will run a new \"homeOS\" operating system with a customizable widget-focused home screen, and revolve around Siri, Apple Intelligence, and HomeKit, he added. The hub could double as a home security system by displaying camera footage, and it is said to have a built-in camera that allows for FaceTime video calls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's hub would compete with products like Google's Nest Hub and Amazon's Echo Show, which are priced in the $150 to $300 range. Kuo and Gurman both said Apple is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-smart-home-camera-rumor/\">planning a wireless security camera</a> that would work with the hub.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear if Apple will actually use HomePod branding for the home hub, or if it will opt for all-new naming. It is also unclear if the current HomePod speaker will be updated next year, but a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-tv-homepod-mini-2025-launch/\">new HomePod mini is expected to launch next year</a>. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">Apple Command Center</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/21/homepod-with-7-inch-display-report/\">New 'HomePod' With 7-Inch Display, A18 Chip, and More Reportedly Launching Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-homepod-with-7-inch-display-a18-chip-and-more-reportedly-launching-next-year.2445895/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3be3f95afbc6f893b39e71c1e94b92c39ba2914b62ae715d3c7062aaf03de457","category":"Apple"}
