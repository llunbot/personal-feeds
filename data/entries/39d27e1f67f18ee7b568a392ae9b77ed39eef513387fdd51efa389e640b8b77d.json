It offers much that was missing from its predecessor, not least a 13th sprocket and a price that’s more competitive with Shimano and SRAM. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now the battle lines have been redrawn, how do the three top spec groupsets compare and which comes out on top? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Shift logic</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-4-970x646.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-4-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-4-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-4-768x511.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-4-1536x1023.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-4-2048x1364.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-4-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-4-1140x759.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-4-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-4-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-4-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The return of the thumb lever will cause Campagnolo fans to rejoice, particularly if, as claimed, its ease of use from different hand positions has been improved. It should be easier to avoid a mis-shift than with its paired lever design in the last generation groupset and it cleaves to the brand’s one lever, one action dictum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano has made it less easy to hit the wrong shift button with its current Dura-Ace than with its predecessor, but it’s still the easiest groupset to mis-shift, particularly with numb fingers in winter-weight gloves on a sub-zero ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, SRAM’s one shifter per lever is the most intuitive, although it’s still fairly easy to initiate an accidental front shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM also has the greatest array of satellite shifter options as you can festoon your bars with up to four sets of its wireless blips. Shimano users have to make do with a single set of wired satellite shifters, while Campagnolo has yet to offer off-lever shifting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three groupset makers now offer a magic third button that can be programmed to do everything but put the kettle on, although you can probably get it to do that too with a bit of ingenuity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winner: SRAM, although everyone has their personal favourite</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-970x332.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'stay one step ahead of the pack, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-970x332.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-300x103.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-768x263.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-1536x526.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-2048x701.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-750x257.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-1140x390.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shift speed</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/03071508/shimano_ultegradura-ace_12-speed4-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"shimano_ultegradura-ace_12-speed4\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano claimed at launch that it had upped its shift speed with the launch of the 12-speed Dura-Ace groupset and we noted the faster shifting than its predecessor when riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM’s shifting has historically lagged behind Shimano’s but we reckon the latest Red AXS has pretty much caught up, with front shifting in particular much improved. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the launch of Super Record 13, Campagnolo claims the fastest shift speed of any groupset.

It depends. All three of the groupset makers can lay claim to the lowest weight in one configuration or another. Campagnolo claims Super Record 13 is the lowest of the lot by around 50g, at 2445g versus SRAM’s quoted 2,496g. When <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/sram-red-axs-2024\">new Red AXS was launched</a>, SRAM in turn claimed Red AXS was 66g lighter than Dura-Ace, so on those numbers Super Record 13 is 116g lighter than Dura-Ace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pick your configuration and you can probably make any of the three lightest.

It does offer four chainring combinations: 46/36t, 50/34t, 52/36t and 54/40t, although the 46/36t combo is targeted at cyclocross and so rather niche. Pros can ask for other combos with even larger chainrings that Shimano keeps under the counter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM offers four Red cassettes: 10-28t, 10-30t, 10-33t and 10-36t, so it’s got close ratios covered, as well as the widest range cassette of the three groupsets. It pairs this with three chainring combos: 46/33t, 48/35t and 50/37t, which are comparable in top-end ratios to a compact, mid-compact and standard cranksets with an 11-tooth smallest sprocket. The 10-36t cassette, in particular, offers significantly lower ratios when paired with these than Shimano’s cassettes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opt for a power meter and more SRAM chainring combinations open up: 52/39t, 54/41t and 56/43t, although these can only be bought as a power meter kit, without cranks. SRAM also sells 1x power meter chainrings to pair with its 12-speed (and 13-speed) cranks. These offer nine sizes from 48t up to 68t, to satisfy the big gear pushers in time-trials. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo offers the largest array of stock combinations. Its four cassettes are comparable to SRAM’s, albeit with slightly less range. There are 10-29t, 10-33t, 11-32t and 11-36t options.

That’s changed with the current groupset though, where the 1×13-speed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-xplr-axs-groupset-review\">Red XPLR AXS</a> is a stand-alone groupset that doesn’t share components other than the shifters, chain and battery with 2×12-speed Red AXS, even though they use the same wireless protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM is currently the only one of the big three to offer a 1x option, although Campagnolo has announced that 1x Super Record will follow the 2x groupset this autumn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano sticks to 2x for its road bike groupsets. If you want a 1×12-speed groupset for gravel, you’ll need to swap to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-grx-rx820-groupset-review\">GRX </a>and that’s currently mechanical only. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winner: SRAM, although Campagnolo may be snapping at its heels come the autumn</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Batteries</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-1-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record 13\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-1-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-1-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-1-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-1-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-1-2048x1367.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-1-750x501.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-1-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-1-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-1-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Super-Record-13-1-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As first mover, SRAM locked down on-derailleur battery options, patenting batteries that are interchangeable between derailleurs. The ability to swap your front derailleur battery to the back to keep the latter shifting may seem esoteric, but even the pros have been caught out, with Sepp Kuss spotted swapping batteries on a descent during a Giro stage a couple of years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Campagnolo has to settle for a different front and rear derailleur battery shape, although that does mean that it has been able to design batteries that meld into the overall shape of its two components better than SRAM’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano, meanwhile, has stuck to its in-frame battery with its current generation Dura-Ace (and Ultegra and 105 Di2) groupset. It’s slightly unclear if this has larger capacity than SRAM’s batteries, as Shimano quotes kilometres and SRAM quotes hours. Its claimed range is greater at 1,000km than Campagnolo’s 750km though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where Campagnolo does score is providing both on-bike and off-bike recharging. SRAM just has off-bike charging, which is in general easier than Shimano’s on-bike charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winner: SRAM, especially if you regularly forget to charge your batteries</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Brakes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM Red AXS groupset brakes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Reviewers always remark on how good Campagnolo’s disc brakes are. It doesn’t look to have changed the formula, although adding a sintered pad option should add more flexibility to tune your braking to the conditions and where you’re riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second generation Red AXS has changed brake lever pivot positioning, which SRAM says makes for a lighter action.

It retains the stealthy black of its predecessor, while even the chain and cassette now have a black chrome finish. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the carbon cranks it looks slick, while the rear derailleur in particular has slimmed down significantly. We’re less enamoured of the HPPM power meter, which to our mind looks more like a triple than the pinnacle of power measurement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Red AXS retains the rather industrial looks of its predecessor, perhaps even accentuating them with its skeleton components. The chunky batteries hooked off the rear of both derailleurs aren’t as pretty as Campagnolo’s design either, so maybe not being able to use the same battery for both mechs has worked in Campagnolo’s favour. SRAM’s shifters may have slimmed down, but they’re still the ugliest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To our eyes, Dura-Ace still has the slickest looks though. Its high gloss finish, smoothly integrated chainrings and sparse derailleur bodies are noticeably lighter than the competition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s because Shimano has cheated and kept the in-frame battery. It’s becoming increasingly hard to hide in modern framesets and beginning to impact bike design adversely.

Campagnolo says its pricing is now in line with the competition, unlike the last generation <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-super-record-wireless-groupset-review\">Super Record WRL</a>, which was considerably more expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At £3,900 without a power meter, Super Record 13 is slightly cheaper than the £4,090 we quoted for SRAM Red <em>with </em>a power meter in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\">our review</a>. We quoted £3,513 for Dura-Ace without a power meter in our review, although that was back in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-power-meters-cycling\">power meter</a> and Super Record 13’s list price heads up to £4,950. So although an improvement on the 12-speed groupset, we still reckon Super Record 13 is the most expensive option, particularly since anyone spending so much on a groupset is likely to want a power meter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Winner: SRAM. It’s still the best option for riders who want an in-series power meter, even if replacing a worn chainring or even a cassette is pricey </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>So who wins?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo’s USP for Super Record 13 is its 13th sprocket, although there’s plenty else to love with the new groupset. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he reviewed Shimano’s upgrade to 12 speeds with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-groupset-review\">Dura-Ace R9200</a>, James remarked that his cadence wasn’t nuanced enough to feel the effect of the extra gear ratio. It feels as if adding a 13th speed to Super Record may also be a case of diminishing returns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For bike brands and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/worldtour-team-bikes\">pro teams</a>, for a long time it’s been Shimano first with Campagnolo a distant third, although SRAM is an increasingly popular option for the pros and beginning to snap at Shimano’s heels for groupsets for new bikes, particularly at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-rival-etap-axs-groupset-review\">Rival AXS</a>/105 Di2 level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, however good Super Record 13 may be, we don’t see that pecking order changing any time soon. But for Campagnlo lovers and Italian bike = Italian groupset riders, it’s definitely a step in a good direction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll reserve our final judgement pending a full review of Super Record 13, but for the moment it feels as if SRAM is still top dog for the sheer diversity of options and degree of innovation it offers. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+7\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'join us and discover the world's best places to ride, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-7-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/campagnolo-super-record-13-vs-shimano-dura-ace-vs-sram-red-axs\">Campagnolo Super Record 13 vs Shimano Dura-Ace vs SRAM Red AXS: How do the top tier groupsets compare?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"39d27e1f67f18ee7b568a392ae9b77ed39eef513387fdd51efa389e640b8b77d","category":"Cycling"}
