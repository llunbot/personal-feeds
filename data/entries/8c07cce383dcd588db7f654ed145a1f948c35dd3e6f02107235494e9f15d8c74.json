Otero said it tore through the roof and both floors of his two-story house in Naples, Florida.</p>\n<p>Otero wasn't home at the time, but his son was there. A Nest home security camera captured the sound of the crash at 2:34 pm local time (19:34 UTC) on March 8. That's an important piece of information because it is a close match for the time—2:29 pm EST (19:29 UTC)—that US Space Command recorded the reentry of a piece of space debris from the space station. At that time, the object was on a path over the Gulf of Mexico, heading toward southwest Florida.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013803#p3\">Read 34 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013803&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8c07cce383dcd588db7f654ed145a1f948c35dd3e6f02107235494e9f15d8c74","category":"Tech"}
