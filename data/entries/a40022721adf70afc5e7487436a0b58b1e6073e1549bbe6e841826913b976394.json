So we thought it's a good time to look at how Tandem OLED is used, what benefits it's delivering, and how the technology could impact future devices and compete against other emerging display technologies, like MicroLED and QDEL.</p>\n<h2>OLED TVs, monitors already use different kinds of tandem stacks</h2>\n<p>We won’t go too deep into the technical details of Tandem OLED in this article (interested readers can reference this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3moprE5S3Qc\">handy breakdown</a>, which also includes information on current technical obstacles, like light-extraction inefficiencies). But if you're new to Tandem OLED, here’s a brief look at what makes it so interesting for tech gadgets.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041081#p3\">Read 52 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041081&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a40022721adf70afc5e7487436a0b58b1e6073e1549bbe6e841826913b976394","category":"Tech"}
