In a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.14028.pdf\">paper</a> highlighted on the <a href=\"https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/estimating-respiratory-rate\">Apple Machine Learning Research website</a> and spotted by <em><a href=\"https://www.myhealthyapple.com/apples-new-research-shows-that-respiratory-rate-can-be-monitored-using-airpods-or-wearables-with-audio/\">MyHealthyApple</a></em>, researchers found that \"wearable headphones\" are able to pick up audible inhalations and exhalations during exertion using the device's on-board microphones.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the paper, the appeal of remote estimation of RR is that it offers a cost-effective method of tracking disease progression and cardio-respiratory fitness over time using \"accessible, aesthetically acceptable,\" non-invasive wearable devices.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Data was collected from 21 individuals using microphone-enabled, near-field headphones before, during, and after strenuous exercise. RR was manually annotated by counting audibly perceived inhalations and exhalations.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA multi-level convolutional neural network was used to achieve signal clarity among other things and the results observed show that RR can be estimated with a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.76 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.2, demonstrating that audio can be a viable signal for passively estimating RR.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n[...]\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nResults presented validate that RR can be estimated from audio captured using wearable microphones, enabling the detection of heavy breathing conditions and the monitoring of RR changes, a measure of cardio-respiratory fitness, over time. The findings show promise for further development of a respiratory health tool with a larger study cohort.</blockquote>While the paper doesn't name ‌AirPods‌ as such, Apple is known to have explored the potential of adding health monitoring features to the truly wireless earphones. For example, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/15/apple-patent-airpods-biometric-sensors/\">one Apple patent</a> describes an earbud-based fitness monitoring system which integrates an advanced biometric sensor that can detect physiological metrics including temperature, heart rate, perspiration levels and more, through skin contact and via built-in motion sensors.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, <em>DigiTimes</em> has suggested that health sensors could be included in ‌AirPods‌ in one to two years, and Apple's vice president of technology Kevin Lynch in June 2021 said that Apple may one day <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/16/apple-executive-hints-airpods-health-data/\">build</a> health features into the ‌AirPods‌ to provide users with additional health data.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is already expected to add support for respiratory rate tracking via a user's Apple Watch in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>. Code seen by <em>MacRumors</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/23/ios-15-apple-watch-series-7-feature/\">suggests</a> that the Health app will be able to display respiratory rate data after a workout or upon waking up, along with blood glucose highlights and heart rate.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe debut of new health monitoring features in ‌‌iOS 15‌‌ cannot be taken as concrete evidence that Apple is planning to bring them to the Apple Watch Series 7, but we'll find out soon for sure. The Apple Watch Series 7 is expected to be announced in September, alongside <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/\">third-generation AirPods</a> that ape the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> design. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-machine-learning-journal/\">Apple Machine Learning Journal</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/12/apple-research-airpods-respiratory-rate/\">Apple Research Suggests AirPods Could Be Used to Estimate Respiratory Rate</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-research-suggests-airpods-could-be-used-to-estimate-respiratory-rate.2307329/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=79HqWmQxikk:2fqqsc7oQPM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=79HqWmQxikk:2fqqsc7oQPM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/79HqWmQxikk\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1408d6f1616c6383dc22544a8b74b06e522a5502fd915750c4a8ea78f3a64800","category":"Apple"}
