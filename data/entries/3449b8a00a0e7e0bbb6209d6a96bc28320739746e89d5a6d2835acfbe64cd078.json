Reach options span a 410mm to 530mm range, with 10mm increments separating each. If in the unlikely event that array does not include a set of geometry figures that tickles your fancy, there is also the option to specify your very own custom geometry. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I’m so stoked on this one. This bike is genuinely our best yet! It’s most at home charging downhill but its pedalling ability surprised me from the first ride, the AM.170 is equally happy doing all day big mountain days as it is taking on the Oakley line. If I had to choose just one bike from our range to ride every weekend, this would be the one!”</p>\n<cite>Dan Atherton</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/atherton-am170-enduro-mtb-3d-printed-laster-sintered.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/atherton-am170-enduro-mtb-3d-printed-laster-sintered-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"charlie hatton corners hard atherton am170 mullet enduro mtb\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/atherton-am170-enduro-mtb-3d-printed-laster-sintered-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/atherton-am170-enduro-mtb-3d-printed-laster-sintered-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/atherton-am170-enduro-mtb-3d-printed-laster-sintered-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/atherton-am170-enduro-mtb-3d-printed-laster-sintered-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/atherton-am170-enduro-mtb-3d-printed-laster-sintered-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/atherton-am170-enduro-mtb-3d-printed-laster-sintered-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/atherton-am170-enduro-mtb-3d-printed-laster-sintered.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Credit: Ian Lean</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The AM.170 is a dedicated mullet, with a 29″ front wheel and a 27.5″ rear. Its DW6 platform utilizes, you guessed it, 6 links to deliver 170mm of rear wheel travel, a linkage design created by Dave Weagle specifically for the titanium-lugged construction of Atherton Bikes. We are told it has “outstanding small bump sensitivity, good support in the mid-stroke while being progressive enough to accommodate the biggest of hits”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My personal experience of the DW6 platform at <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-ride-atherton-am-130-x/\" target=\"_blank\">Dyfi Bike Park on the AM.130.X</a> leaves me agreeing with that statement. The AM.170 matches its rear wheel travel with a 170mm fork, but the option remains to boost that to a 180mm fork. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We await complete information on geometry and kinematic. For now, we leave you with this Walk-Through of the AM.170 Enduro MTB from Atherton Bikes, and of course a Ride-Through, if you will, featuring Charlie Hatton.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Atherton AM.170 Enduro Bike Walk-Through</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“There’s no shortage of tracks here in Dyfi so this bike has been thoroughly tested on bike park jump lines, National stages of the British Enduro Series and the 20 minute+ Enduro descents that Athy has built here in the Dyfi Forest. When we head out there on a staff ride this bike is all time.”</p>\n<cite>Dan Brown, CEO of Atherton Bikes</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>All Atherton Bikes are made to order in the heart of the Dyfi Valley, Wales, on their state-of-the-art additive manufacturing rig. It takes over 16 hours to 3D print all of the lugs for a single frame via the titanium laser sintering process, a quick video of more which you can <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-ride-atherton-am-130-x/\" target=\"_blank\">read here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/atherton-bikes-titanium-lugs-additive-manufacturing-renishaw-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/atherton-bikes-titanium-lugs-additive-manufacturing-renishaw-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"A half-finished plate of titanium lugs - thanks to a power cut caused by storms earlier this year\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/atherton-bikes-titanium-lugs-additive-manufacturing-renishaw-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/atherton-bikes-titanium-lugs-additive-manufacturing-renishaw-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/atherton-bikes-titanium-lugs-additive-manufacturing-renishaw-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/atherton-bikes-titanium-lugs-additive-manufacturing-renishaw-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/atherton-bikes-titanium-lugs-additive-manufacturing-renishaw-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/atherton-bikes-titanium-lugs-additive-manufacturing-renishaw-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/atherton-bikes-titanium-lugs-additive-manufacturing-renishaw.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices for the AM.170 start from £4,500 for a frameset with the choice of a Fox DHX2 Coil or Fox Float X2 Air Shock.
