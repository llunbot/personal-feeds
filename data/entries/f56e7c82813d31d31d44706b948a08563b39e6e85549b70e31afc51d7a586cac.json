The exact amount that Google pays Apple has not been publicly disclosed during the trial, as a lot of the testimony in the case has taken place behind closed doors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCue reportedly last negotiated the deal between Apple and Google in 2016. When asked why Apple chose Google as its default search engine, Cue said \"there wasn't a valid alternative to Google at the time,\" and he said there still isn't one.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"We make Google be the default search engine because we've always thought it was the best,\" added Cue. \"We pick the best one and let users easily change it.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCue acknowledged that Apple feels it is more committed to privacy than Google, but argued that the deal between the two companies requires Google to allow users to search without logging in, and said that Apple has built several privacy protections into its Safari web browser in order to ensure that users are safeguarded.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCue also admitted that Apple does not allow users to change the default search engine during the iPhone's setup process, but he said this decision supports Apple's goal of getting users \"up and running as fast as possible.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo change the iPhone's default search engine at any point after setup, users can simply open the Settings app, tap Safari, tap Search Engine, and select one of the available options: Google, Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or Ecosia.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23891037/apple-eddy-cue-testimony-us-google\"><em>The Verge</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/technology/google-antitrust-trial-secrecy.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> have additional coverage of Cue's testimony.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/\">Eddy Cue</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-on-why-google-is-default-on-iphone/\">Apple's Eddy Cue Explains Why Google is iPhone's Default Search Engine</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-eddy-cue-explains-why-google-is-iphones-default-search-engine.2404859/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f56e7c82813d31d31d44706b948a08563b39e6e85549b70e31afc51d7a586cac","category":"Apple"}
