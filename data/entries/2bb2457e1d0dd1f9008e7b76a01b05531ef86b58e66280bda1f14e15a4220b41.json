This one also wears an optional off-road kit.

The two new versions slot around those carsâ€”there's a rear-wheel drive, single-motor Macan as the new entry-level car, and a Macan 4S that fills the gap between the two already-revealed cars.</p>\n<h2>Macan</h2>\n<p>The entry-level Macan uses the same rear drive unit as the Macan 4 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/the-2024-porsche-macan-ev-has-character-pace-and-the-right-badge/\">we tested in April</a>. Doing without a front motor means a weight savings of 243 lbs (110 kg) from the front of the car, which should have a positive benefit on handling, even if this will be the slowest Macan in the range.</p>\n<p>Slow being a relative term here, for we are discussing both a Porsche and also an electric car. A nominal output of 335 hp (250 kW) is more than sufficient for day-to-day driving, and the motor can overboost to 355 hp (265 kW) and 415 lb-ft (562 Nm) for standing starts in launch mode. Do so, and you can hurl the basic Macan down the road to 60 mph in 5.4 seconds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037178#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037178&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
