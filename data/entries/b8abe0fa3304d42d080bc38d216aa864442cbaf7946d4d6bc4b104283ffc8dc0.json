The updates are minor overall, but they do include a useful change for the Screen Time feature on iPhones and iPads.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Screen-Time-iOS-16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nSpecifically, Apple says that parents will now receive a notification when their Screen Time passcode is successfully entered on their child's device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis change will allow parents to be alerted immediately if their child has correctly guessed or figured out the Screen Time passcode, which can allow the child to turn off or adjust the restrictions that were set by their parents.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nParents will also receive these notifications on a Mac running macOS 15.5, which should be released to the general public next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nScreen Time launched in 2018 as part of iOS 12, providing parents with settings to remotely manage a child's device. For example, parents can restrict device usage to certain times, set time limits for apps, and block inappropriate content.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/screen-time/\">Screen Time</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/ios-18-5-includes-a-useful-change-to-screen-time/\">iOS 18.5 Includes a Useful Change to Screen Time</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-5-includes-a-useful-change-to-screen-time.2456613/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b8abe0fa3304d42d080bc38d216aa864442cbaf7946d4d6bc4b104283ffc8dc0","category":"Apple"}
