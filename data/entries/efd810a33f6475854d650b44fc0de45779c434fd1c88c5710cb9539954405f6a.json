The company will use this pressurized capsule, called <em>Excelsior</em>, for a series of test flights this year over the Atlantic Ocean just off the coast of Cape Canaveral. Taber MacCallum, Space Perspective's co-founder and chief technology officer, said employees have also finished fabricating the giant balloon that will lift the test capsule into the upper atmosphere for the first test flight.</p>\n<p>The final piece of the puzzle is a ship named <em>Marine Spaceport Voyager </em>that Space Perspective will use to launch the balloon and capsule. This vessel is due to depart an outfitting facility in Louisiana in the next few weeks for a trip to Port Canaveral, Florida, where Space Perspective will unload the capsule and balloon. Then, perhaps in four to six weeks, ground teams will be ready for the system's first test flight, according to MacCallum.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004772#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004772&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"efd810a33f6475854d650b44fc0de45779c434fd1c88c5710cb9539954405f6a","category":"Tech"}
