If this information is accurate, macOS 15 would be compatible with all Macs that support macOS Sonoma, with one possible exception: the 2019 iMac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nmacOS Sonoma is compatible with the 2019 iMac, which does not have a T2 chip, so it is unclear if that model will support macOS 15 or be dropped.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is the rumored compatibility list for macOS 15:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><strong>MacBook Pro:</strong> 2018 and later</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>MacBook Air:</strong> 2018 and later</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Mac mini:</strong> 2018 and later</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iMac:</strong> 2019 and later*</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iMac Pro:</strong> 2017</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Mac Studio:</strong> 2022 and later</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Mac Pro:</strong> 2019 and later</li></ul>* iMac would be 2020 and later if a T2 chip is required.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEven if macOS 15 supports many Intel-based Macs, new on-device AI capabilities will likely be limited to Apple silicon Macs, which have a Neural Engine.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe leaker who revealed this information has a private account on X, so we have elected not to share its name or link to it, but they have shared accurate compatibility information and build numbers for Apple's software updates in the past.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhat name will Apple use for macOS 15? That remains a mystery.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/\">macOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/macos-15-compatible-macs-rumor/\">macOS 15 Rumored to Support Same Macs as macOS Sonoma, With One Possible Exception</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-15-rumored-to-support-same-macs-as-macos-sonoma-with-one-possible-exception.2428609/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"69db4237fe74b4bc180eb3911ce2be0d73f2941e3db762d5841690024dfe31c6","category":"Apple"}
