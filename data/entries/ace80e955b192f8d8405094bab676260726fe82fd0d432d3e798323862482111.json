We have investigated every rumor and trend we could find to bring you our predictions. Read on to find out what could be in store.  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>New iPhones and Apple Watches are expected at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple event on September 9</a>.

What else can we expect to see in 2024? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the sections below we’ve split products into categories including Mac, iPad, iPhone and some new product categories.

Expect larger displays on the Pro models, a new 48Mp ultrawide lens, a touch-sensitive “camera control” on the side, and a new Action button. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-price-features.html\">iPhone 16 rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? 9 September 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone SE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t expect to see this in September, but there have been a few rumors about the iPhone SE. A supposed leak revealed a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2254092/iphone-se-4-cad-leak-6-1-inch-screen-face-id-notch-camera.html\">bigger screen, notch and Face ID</a>, for example. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t the first we’ve heard of a bigger version of the iPhone SE.

Spring 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New AirPods </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Max are desperately in need of an update. Will they get an update in 2024? Unfortunately, there aren’t any noisy rumors about them right now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are rumors about a new cheaper AirPods model, dubbed AirPods Lite by some. These are said to cost $99 and could arrive alongside 4th-gen AirPods in 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wait for new AirPods Pro, however, could stretch to 2025. They could offer new health-related features when they arrive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">New AirPods rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Late 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Apple Watch </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect that Apple will launch an Apple Watch Series 10, said to have a larger screen, and a third-generation Apple Watch Ultra with a new black/dark color scheme, on September 9, 2024. Both will feature a new S10 chip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A third-gen Apple Watch SE is also possible with screen size changes too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">New Apple Watch 2024</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? <em>September</em> 9, 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Macs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the update for the Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2023 Apple finished transitioning all its Macs from Intel processors to its own silicon. Apple launched the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips at the end of October 2023. The M3 MacBook Air launched since, but the rest of the Mac range has been silent this year, despite the M4 arriving in the iPad! We can expect the following updates soon: </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac mini &amp; Mac mini Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the iMac has an M3 chip, and the MacBook Pro an M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chip, the arrival of those chips in the Max mini is long over due. Except that the rumors indicate that the Mac mini update is going to feature an M4 chip, and we may see it before the end of 2024. However, there are also rumors that the Mac mini is getting a new, smaller design, in which case the wait could be a little longer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">New Mac mini rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? <em>Late 202</em>4</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac Studio </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next on the list for update will be the Mac Studio, also likely to bypass the M3 and jump straight to the M4 Max and M4 Ultra. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">M3 Mac Studio rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? <em>Late</em> 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac Pro </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the Mac Studio is getting an update with the M4 Max and M4 Ultra you can rest assured that the Mac Pro will too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320613/m3-m4-ultra-mac-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">Mac Pro 2024 rumors.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? <em><em><em>Late</em> 2024</em></em></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iMac Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a new iMac with M3 chip, but it’s still got a 24-inch screen. What people want is a return of a more professional iMac with a bigger screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is said to be working on a Pro version of the iMac, a return of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">27-inch iMac Pro</a> perhaps. It sounds like an M4 Pro iMac might happen, but we could be waiting a little longer for that one.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">Larger iMac Pro rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPads</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://bilder.macwelt.de/4315300_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPad Pro\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>The iPad Pro</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPad Pro\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>The iPad Pro</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski/IDG</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPad Pro\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>The iPad Pro</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski/IDG</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>No iPads were updated in 2023 – the first time a year passed without an iPad update. There was one iPad that wasn’t even updated in 2022—the iPad mini—so that looks the most likely for an imminent update. But the whole range is probably headed for a refresh this year, and that process started on May 7, when we got new Airs and Pros.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPad mini </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A new iPad mini (7th generation) could be coming soon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/new-ipad-mini-7-2022-release-date-price-specs.html\">iPad mini 7th gen rumors</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Late 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>11th-gen iPad</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest standard iPad joined the lineup as long ago as October 2022 so a new model can be expected in 2024. Note that the 9th-gen model was retired on May 7, with the 10th-gen model remaining on sale at a lower price. We’d expect the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2024-release-date.html\">11th-gen iPad</a> to roughly match its predecessor’s old price when it launches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? <em>Late 2024</em></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New product categories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple was never to innovate away from the products it makes right now it could be left behind as technology progresses. It’s no surprise therefore that the company is working on various new areas. We don’t expect these to land in 2023, but rumors suggest that some of them still could arrive sooner rather than later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HomePod with screen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We do hope there is some truth in the rumors that Apple is working on a HomePod with a screen. We’ve always said that a screen would make the HomePod infinitely more usable, but perhaps we are the only ones who hate having to talk to our speaker and control the HomePod via an iPhone (which can be a drain on the battery).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A screen would extend the uses of the HomePod beyond audio into visual – so you could watch podcasts and news reports and YouTube videos, but most usefully communicate via FaceTime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far all Apple has done is brought back the full-size HomePod that it removed from sale. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with screen rumours</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When?

Perhaps “Vision Pro 2” and “Vision Air?” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t expect them soon, though. Rumors vary, but none of them say that new Vision hardware is due until at least 2025, maybe even 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do hope to get news as to when Apple will release the current Vision Pro around the world soon. Read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-vision-pro-features-specs-price-faq.html\">When will the Vision Pro launch outside the US. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? 2025 or later</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Apple released in 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple hit the ground running in 2023 with new Macs and a new HomePod in January. Then at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/wwdc\">WWDC</a> in June the company launched no less than three new Macs and a brand new device – the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-vision-pro-release-date-headset-specs-price.html\">Vision Pro</a> – alongside revealing its plans for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS 14 Sonoma</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1792869/watchos-10-release-date-new-features.html\">watchOS 10</a>. Finally (maybe) Apple launched the new iPhone 15 series and the Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/no-new-ipad-air-mini-pro-2023.html\">event</a> in September and then made macOS Sonoma and iOS 17 available for customers to download later that month. Then at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1064916/apple-october-event-date-time-mac-ipad.html\">Apple event on October 30</a> the company unveiled new MacBook Pro and iMac models.
