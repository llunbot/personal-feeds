While fluid intake on the bike is vital for many reasons, including as a means of taking on vital electrolytes that <em>do</em> help combat cramp, the root cause is neuromuscular fatigue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repetitive use of muscles or muscle groups during <span>exercise causes tiredness, which disrupts the normally efficient neuromuscular pathways which control our muscle movement. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point at which this starts to happen depends on your fitness level, glycogen and energy stores, as well as external factors such as altitude, temperature and humidity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to deal with cramp when cycling</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/01/02121608/alain_gallopin_sticky_bottle-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hydration</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hydration is important, as electrolytes such as sodium and potassium play a key role in facilitating communication between your nerves and your muscles. If you’re insufficiently hydrated you will become tired more quickly – and that means neuromuscular fatigue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The replacement of electrolytes into the body is no longer considered as important as it once was but it’s still a factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So make sure that you drink between one and two bidons an hour depending on the heat and your effort. One bottle should contain water, the other an electrolyte-rich drink.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Strength, conditioning and a proper bike-fit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It also helps to stretch properly both before and during the ride. This will warm up your muscles and increase their range of movement, helping them work more efficiently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is a particular muscle that cramps regularly on the bike, take time pre-ride to limber it up before riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Off-the-bike training to build core strength and flexibility can also help so do not neglect high rep, low weight workouts to your legs, core and back to increase muscle endurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Als proper bike-fit will ensure your muscles are working at their optimal range and that you’re in the most comfortable riding position your bike can afford.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Acclimatisation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest factors can be heat, especially riding in a hotter climate than you are used to, like at a sportive on the continent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A warmer climate can put your body through heat stress. This, in turn, makes your body sweat a lot quicker, lowering your core temperature and increasing your chances of cramp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be combatted, however. Our bodies are marvellous things and can quite quickly adapt to a new surrounding. With this the case, try to arrive a day or two before an event to allow your body to settle in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Foods that that can help combat cramp</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nutrition is arguably your biggest ally in the war against cramp. Providing your muscles with sufficient nourishment – and the right kind of nourishment – will enable them to work better, faster and longer, helping to keep the dreaded cramp at bay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are four food types you should focus on as a cyclist:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Potassium-rich foods:</strong> A lot of people don’t get enough potassium in their diet and if you find cramps creeping up on you when you ride, this may be the cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Potassium is essential – along with sodium – for regulating the electrical signals that can cause your muscles to seize up.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get it from… bananas, baked potatoes, sweet potatoes, yoghurt, beans, dates, spinach, and that wonder of nature broccoli.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sodium-rich foods:</strong> When your body sweats to stop it overheating, you excrete not just moisture but salt. Salt (or the sodium in salt) is needed to regulate those cramp-causing mixed signals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But excessive salt in your diet can acause high blood pressure, so swerve the salted nuts and look instead to get your sodium from wholefoods.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get it from… beets, celery, carrots, spinach and chard.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Calcium-rich foods:</strong> Low levels of calcium in your body can also lead to muscle cramps and as cycling is a non-impact, endurance exercise that causes you to sweat a lot, you’ll also need to get a lot of this particular mineral into your diet to help maintain healthy bone density, especially as you get older.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get it from… natural yoghurt (unsweetened Greek varieties are best), sardines, turnips, dark green leafy vegetables, low-fat cheeses and milk.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Carb-rich foods:</strong> Because road cycling is an endurance sport, depletion of your body’s glycogen (its energy stores) is an inevitable consequence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as glycogen is mostly stored in your muscles, it figures that the lower those levels are, the more likely you are to suffer cramps.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get it from… potatoes, legumes, brown rice, bananas, pasta etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-stop-leg-cramp-when-cycling\">How to stop leg cramp when cycling</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"jcunningham","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"4209e87916feaab4f6d4689dbc656537270447aec469390b3d76c797a3709d17","category":"Cycling"}
