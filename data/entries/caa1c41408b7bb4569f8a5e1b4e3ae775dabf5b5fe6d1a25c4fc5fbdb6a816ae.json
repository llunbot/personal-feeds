Unfortunately, bikes are also very stealable – they’re often ill-protected if not <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/how-to-lock-a-bike/\">locked up properly</a>, easily removable and hard to trace.</p>\n<p>The Crime Survey for England and Wales estimates that <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/overviewofbicycletheft/2017-07-20\">almost 290,000 bikes were stolen in 2017</a>.</p>\n<p>You can increase the chances that your bike will be found and returned to you if you register your bike though. Registration markings act as a deterrent to thieves in the first place, because they know a registered bike will be harder to resell with potential purchasers able to check if it has been stolen.</p>\n<p>The indelible markings also mean that you’ve got a secondary identifier besides your frame number (which you should note down too).</p>\n<p>As a matter of course, you should also make sure that you’ve got photos of your bike and a record of any non-standard components or modifications – this all helps in the event your bike is stolen and you need to identify it.</p>\n<p>It’s also sensible to invest in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bicycle-insurance-guide/\">bicycle insurance</a>, not just in case it’s stolen, but in the event it gets damaged. Most insurance policies will cover third-party liability and provide other protection for the bike and rider.</p>\n<h2>How do I register my bike?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> BikeRegister offers registration services for cyclists, as well as listings of stolen bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BikeRegister</i></span></div>\n<p>In the UK, the main bike registration database is run by <a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a>. It’s a free service and now includes the details of over 1,000,000 bikes.</p>\n<p>BikeRegister allows you to permanently record the basic details of your bike and ownership for free. Additionally, you can purchase one of three different bike-marking kits, which act as a visible deterrent to a would-be thief.</p>\n<p>The simplest Membership Plus kit costs £13 and consists of two tamper-resistant labels that include a QR code linking to your ownership record on the database.</p>\n<p>The £20 Permanent Marking kit adds an indelible ID marking to your bike, while the £30 UV Protect kit enables you to mark your frame and components with ID markers that are only visible under ultraviolet light, in addition to providing visible marking.</p>\n<p>Police forces are working with BikeRegister to mark up bikes too. Forces around the UK regularly hold free bike registration drives as part of their operation to deter bicycle theft.</p>\n<p>There are similar services in other countries too; in the US, an equivalent service is run by <a href=\"https://bikeindex.org/\">Bike Index</a>, while an Australian bike ownership database is operated by the <a href=\"https://www.nationalbikeregister.com.au/\">National Bike Register</a>.</p>\n<h2>How does registration help if my bike is stolen?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Registering your bike can help you get it back if it is stolen.</span></figcaption><span> <i>iStock / Getty Images Plus</i></span></div>\n<p>Having your bike registered helps to prove your ownership if it is stolen.</p>\n<p>The BikeRegister database is used by every police force in the UK to search for stolen bikes – there are over 40,000 stolen bikes currently logged on its site by their owners.</p>\n<p>If your bike is stolen, regardless of whether it is registered, you should notify the police of the theft. Giving them registration details may help further with the search.</p>\n<p>You can also record the loss on the BikeRegister site, along with details and photos.
