The Timeline button on each store detail page has the earliest photo of the store, grand opening art, and gifts distributed at openings, along with info on renovations, anniversaries, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe option to log visits to stores has an added \"receipt\" animation to mark the occasion, along with tools for sharing on social media. Custom store lists can also be created, with the stores selected visible on a map. For example, if you're going to a city with multiple stores, you can compile them in a list and view them on the map to plan stops.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther new additions include search filters for finding stores and store information, Shortcuts for things like searching for nearby stores, and Chinese localization.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFacades can be downloaded on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and Mac.
