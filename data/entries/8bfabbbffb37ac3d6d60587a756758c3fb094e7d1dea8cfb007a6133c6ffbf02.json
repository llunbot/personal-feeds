The tyre will remain in the range as a clincher option.</p>\n<p>The brand claims the new tyre offers consistent grip in all weathers and has been optimised for cold and wet days.</p>\n<p>Produced in the brand’s new Milano-Bollate facility, the P Zero Race TLR 4S is constructed from the brand’s SMARTNET Silica compound with a 120 TPI nylon casing. This compound is also found on the Cinturato Velo, albeit with a less supple 60 TPI casing.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The tyre is intended to straddle the line between performance and reliability.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pirelli</i></span></div>\n<p>Pirelli claims the compound performs particularly well on wet or cold surfaces in cooler temperatures.</p>\n<p>The P Zero Race TLR 4S also uses Pirelli’s SpeedCore technology, which debuted on the P Zero Race TLR. According to Pirelli, this compound uses aramid fibres to provide improved puncture protection and lower rolling resistance, as well as offer a more comfortable ride.</p>\n<p>Pirelli says the tyres are compatible with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/hookless-rims-road-tubeless/\">hookless rims</a>, as long as you do not exceed the ETRTO-recommended 73psi maximum pressure limit.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Like many of its rivals, the P Zero Race TLR 4S sees a shift to wider rubber.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Bike Connection Agency</i></span></div>\n<p>The P Zero Race TLR 4S is available for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/700c-wheels/\">700c wheels</a> in 28, 30 and 32mm widths. It’s claimed to weigh 330g, 365g and 395g respectively for the three widths.</p>\n<p>The tyres will only be available in black, with no mention of a ‘Classic’ (tanwall) option on release.</p>\n<p>The tyres will retail for £78.99 for the 28mm variant, £79.99 for the 30mm tyre and £80.99 for the 32mm.
