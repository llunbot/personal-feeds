While we can’t ignore the significant upgrades these two tablets pack, it was a different iPad announcement that will likely prove to be the more significant one. Towards the event’s end, Apple announced that it was cutting the price of the 10th-gen iPad by $100. Now, with a base price of just $349, the 10th-gen iPad has arguably become the best budget-friendly Apple product—and should be the model for the next iPhone SE.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A troubled start</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple launched the 10th-gen iPad back in late 2022, it was a good device with a bad price: a whopping $449. Back then, we explicitly advised people not to buy it. At $449, it was awkwardly positioned between the $329 9th-gen iPad and the 6th-gen iPad mini at $499, with an even more confusing list of pros and cons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It made more sense for those on a budget to pay $120 less and opt for the 9th-gen model. After all, despite its dated chassis, it was a perfectly functional tablet that supported most iPadOS features and apps. Naturally, you were giving up a lot with the design and performance compared to the higher-end models, but for the price, you’d be getting a very capable iPad without leaving a hole in your pocket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, those who were willing to pay $449 for an entry-level iPad should just pay the extra $50 and get the iPad Mini. For the small upcharge, customers would get the newer A15 Bionic chip, a sharper display with an anti-reflective coating, support for the superior Apple Pencil 2, and a True Tone flash. Perhaps the only relevant downside to opting for the Mini variant was the smaller 8.3-inch display, which could limit certain users’ workflows, but is great for travel, reading, and taking notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whichever way you went, for $449—especially given the other options alongside it—the 10th-gen iPad was just not worth it at the time.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ipad_2022.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPad on a desk, showing the screen\" width=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>The 10th-gen looks like a device that costs twice as much.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPad on a desk, showing the screen\" width=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The 10th-gen looks like a device that costs twice as much.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPad on a desk, showing the screen\" width=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The 10th-gen looks like a device that costs twice as much.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Changing the equation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Until last week, that was the 10th-gen iPad’s biggest flaw: the price. This changed overnight, and now, for many, it’s suddenly the best budget tablet on the market. For the first time, an SE price is getting you a futuristic-looking iPad with modern features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When compared to the discontinued 9th-gen model, the 10th-gen iPad packs a faster A14 Bionic SoC, a larger 10.9-inch display, a more advanced 12MP rear camera with support for 4K video recording, optional 5G, a USB-C port, and much more. That’s not to mention its compatibility with the cheapest Apple Pencil (USB-C), which helps budget-conscious customers save even more. And it’s just $20 more than Apple charged for the 9th-gen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad 10 is finally an agressively priced tablet that features a balanced set of technical specifications. Compare that to the iPhone SE, which costs more at $429 and still has Apple’s old Home button design, an outdated single camera, and a Lightning port.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Superior edition</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For a few years now, Apple has been selling SE products that cater to those on limited budgets. Typically, these devices offer decent power served in dated exterior shells and miss out on many of the newer device’s features. The Apple Watch SE, for example, costs $249 compared to $399 and up for the Apple Watch Series 9. For the extra $150, you’re getting a larger screen and an array of features—a faster chip, always-on display, double-tap gesture, ECG sensor, temperature sensing, and a newer heart rate sensor, the list goes on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the latest iPhone SE costs $429, and — apart from the A15 Bionic (which is showing its age) and proper 5G cellular connectivity support — it’s pretty much inferior to other iPhones Apple sells in every relevant way. It looks like it has escaped from a bygone era, doesn’t have the latest camera features, including night mode, and is missing out on Face ID, and starts at just 64GB of storage.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone SE 2022\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 5002w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=768%2C514&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=1200%2C804&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=1536%2C1029&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=2048%2C1372&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"804\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>The iPhone SE may be inexpensive, but it also feels cheap.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPhone SE 2022\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 5002w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=768%2C514&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=1200%2C804&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=1536%2C1029&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=2048%2C1372&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"804\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The iPhone SE may be inexpensive, but it also feels cheap.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iPhone SE 2022\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 5002w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=768%2C514&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=1200%2C804&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=1536%2C1029&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=2048%2C1372&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-se-2022-hero.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"804\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The iPhone SE may be inexpensive, but it also feels cheap.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Wit both SE models, you’re getting older designs, hardware, and features for a reduced price. They feel cheap because they are cheap. That’s not the case with the 10th-gen iPad. You can browse the web, read ebooks, watch movies, video call, play games, and even run Logic Pro. It’s equally as capable as a device that costs three times as much. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the 10th-gen iPad, you’re not sacrificing the aesthetics for a low price. You’re having your cake <em>and</em> eating it. Despite its $349 price tag, this model manages to follow the same modern design language adopted by the flagship iPads. Sure, its display bezels may not be as thin and the tech not as high, but, otherwise, it looks and feels pretty similar. And its chip packs enough power to handle casual users’ typical tablet needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A bit of everything</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad 10 manages to offer reliable entertainment and basic computing experiences. Through this tablet, users have access to a wide range of well-optimized iPadOS apps, which include games, productivity suites, streaming services, social media, and education platforms. You don’t need to sacrifice anything—the screen is the same size as the Air, the chip is plenty fast, the charging port is USB-C, and you can even use it with an Apple Pencil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the iPad 10 admittedly won’t replace your smartphone or computer, it sure will complement them. Features like Sidecar turn it into one of the best multipurpose, wireless monitors you can pair with your Mac. Similarly, handing off a document from your iPhone to sign it on your iPad using an Apple Pencil is the kind of premium ecosystem magic that this budget tablet doesn’t miss out on. It’s everything an SE should be just without the name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At $349, the iPad 10 has become hands down one of the best purchases anyone can grab from the Apple Store. And the rest of Apple’s SE products should start taking notes.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1fba72e4ceba7bdb987952a44b3f306373488593b2318e87f0b8c20aefe0cf4a","category":"Apple"}
