The company said it had taken action to secure the exploit and prevent similar future unauthenticated requests.\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"We have seen no evidence that the threat actors obtained access to Twilio's systems or other sensitive data,\" said the company in a <a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/en-us/changelog/Security_Alert_Authy_App_Android_iOS\">blog post</a>. \"While Authy accounts are not compromised, threat actors may try to use the phone number associated with Authy accounts for phishing and smishing attacks; we encourage all Authy users to stay diligent and have heightened awareness around the texts they are receiving.\"</blockquote>As Twilio notes, obtaining a list of phone numbers may not appear in itself to pose a severe security threat. However, attackers could conceivably contact users and claim to be Authy or Twilio representatives in order to get them to reveal personal information as part of a phishing campaign. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsers should update to the latest version of the iOS app, available on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>. Twilio also advises users who cannot access their Authy account to contact its support team immediately.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-safari-2fa-code-generator/\">How to Use Safari's Built-in 2FA Code Generator</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nAt the beginning of the year, Authy announced that it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/authy-desktop-apps-end-of-life-march-2024/\">shutting down</a> its Mac and Linux desktop apps in August 2024, but ended up bringing the date forward.
