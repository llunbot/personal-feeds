This hybrid lacing system relies on a rip chord closure and cinch that tucks inside the top of the tongue, giving it a clean look without a BOA design or big, floppy laces to manage. The Speed Lace comes in the Stamp flat and Mallet clipless designs and comes in two of our favorite colors: fuck yeah, Olive Drab and Desert Tan!</p>\n<p>Check ’em out at <a href=\"https://www.crankbrothers.com/pages/trail-speed-lace-shoes\" target=\"_blank\">Crankbrothers</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/crankbrothers-speed-lace-mallet-stamp-shoes/\">Crankbrothers New Speed Lace in Mallet and Stamp Shoes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"6b6cf4ad6fdd7d7e2b5099de962300ee53451c94d6af021a4d7494c959809783","category":"Cycling"}
