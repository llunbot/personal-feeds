For example, last year <a href=\"https://www.the-express.com/news/world-news/113090/vladimir-putin-squad-north-america-fascism-ukraine-war\">a very earnest-looking group of elderly women</a>, and a few men, urged Russia to \"take back Alaska\" in an attempt to preserve the United States from fascism. One of the women in the video also advocated for a military alliance with Mexico, saying, \"In order to effectively fight fascism, we must establish military relations with Mexico to prevent the fascism from spreading further. We must form a military alliance with Mexico.\"</p>\n<p>There are entire <a href=\"https://t.me/s/otryady_putina\">Telegram channels</a> devoted to these \"Putin's squads\" videos, and you can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk0Ktc21_lgVNiZRY9Py1Fg\">find them on YouTube</a> as well. It is not clear whether these \"man on the street\" videos are having any impact on Russian opinion, but evidently someone in the Kremlin believes they are helping to shape domestic opinions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044124#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044124&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b1d2f6f1cf3531c6127f61bcabca01a6c9f85b088caa57474e024818f1c6567b","category":"Tech"}
