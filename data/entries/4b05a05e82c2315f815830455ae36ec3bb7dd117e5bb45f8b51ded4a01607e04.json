Well, they do when it’s last year’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tour-de-france-jersey-colours/\">yellow and green jersey</a> winners, Jonas Vingegaard and Wout Van Aert.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Wout Van Aert and Dylan Van Baarle of Team Jumbo-Visma compete during the stage one of the 110th Tour de France 2023.\" title=\"110th Tour de France 2023 - Stage 1\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wout Van Aert and his teammate, Jonas Vingegaard, are using 1x drivetrains for certain stages at this year’s Tour.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>As for why these two are choosing to run 1x instead of 2x, it’s hard to say.</p>\n<p>On the right parcours (<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/wout-van-aert-1x/\">Van Aert used a 1x drivetrain for this year’s Milan-San Remo</a>, for example), it’s possible to eke out a few marginal gains with a 1x setup, such as an improved chainline, marginally reduced aerodynamic drag and, of course, a simpler shifting setup with less risk of chain drops.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with only one chainring available, riders must choose between having lots of gear range but larger jumps between the gears, or less overall range and a tighter cassette, so there are compromises to it as well.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" title=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wide range cassettes help increase the range of a 1x drivetrain, but they also mean larger jumps between gears.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Could it be pressure from the team performance directors or sponsors? SRAM has, after all, pushed 1x for road and gravel much more than Shimano, who sponsor the majority of teams in the peloton.</p>\n<p>We don’t know, of course, though we are sure neither Vingegaard or Van Aert would run it on their bikes if they thought it was a significant disadvantage.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mark Cavendish's Wilier Filante SLR\" title=\"Mark Cavendish's Wilier Filante SLR\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> All of the Shimano-sponsored bikes we saw at this year’s Tour were equipped with 2x drivetrains.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Like the changes from rim to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">disc brakes</a>, tubular to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless tyres</a> and lightweight to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">aero road bikes</a> in recent years, pro riders can sometimes be cautious about tech innovations, so we don’t expect the rest of the peloton to be jumping ship to 1x anytime soon.</p>\n<p>We can still be sure other riders and teams will be paying attention, though, and if Jumbo-Visma does have success on 1x then we may see more of it at the Tour going forward.</p>\n<h2>Divergent tyre choices</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Continental GP5000 S TR tyre on Egan Bernal's Pinarello Dogma F\" title=\"Egan Bernal's Pinarello Dogma F\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Continental GP5000 S TR remains a popular choice at the Tour.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Just when we thought things were calming down in terms of tyre choices, we actually saw a wide variety of types and widths at this year’s Tour.</p>\n<p>As has been happening for a number of years, we’re seeing an ever-increasing amount of tubeless wheels and tyres and far fewer tubular options.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Caleb Ewan's prototype Ridley\" title=\"Caleb Ewan's prototype Ridley\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Caleb Ewan’s prototype Ridley was sporting a 26c Vittoria Corsa Pro TLR tyre up front and a 28c at the rear, on a DT Swiss ARC 1100 wheelset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Interestingly, though, it appears teams haven’t simply settled on 28c <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tubeless-road-tyres/\">tubeless tyres</a> across the board.</p>\n<p>Instead, each team appears to have optimised its tyre setup for the specific bike and wheel combinations it uses.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vittora Corsa Pro tubular tyre on Reserve 34 wheel\" title=\"Jonas Vingegaard's Cervélo S5\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Jonas Vingegaard’s Cervélo S5 had 24.4mm-wide Vittoria Corsa Pro tubular tyres on Reserve 34|37 rims when we saw it prior to the race start.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For example, when we saw Jonas Vingegaard’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cervelo-s5-force-etap-axs-review/\">Cervelo S5</a> at the Jumbo-Visma team hotel, it was equipped with 24mm-wide <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/vittoria-corsa-pro-tlr-first-ride-review/\">Vittoria Corsa Pro</a> tubular tyres.</p>\n<p>That’s quite narrow by modern standards, but given they were mounted to a set of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/reserve-road-and-gravel-wheels/\">Reserve 34|37 wheels</a>, I suspect this was a lightweight combination intended to help get his bike weight down as much as possible for the lumpy opening stages.</p>\n<p>We wouldn’t be surprised if Jonas switched this wheelset for something more aero, perhaps with tubeless tyres, for the flatter or more rolling stages of this year’s Tour.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago V4Rs\" title=\"Tadej Pogačar's Colnago

Pogačar’s bike had <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/first-look-friday/trek-ballista-continental-gp5000-tt-tr/\">Continental GP5000 TT TR</a> tubeless tyres mounted on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/enve-ses-4-5-wheelset-review/\">ENVE SES 4.5 wheels</a>.</p>\n<p>These were nominally a size 28c, but on the ENVE rims – which have a super wide, 25mm internal rim width – these tyres were actually measuring up at a whopping 31.3mm at the front and 32.2mm at the rear.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\"

Pogačar’s rear tyre was ballooning up to a massive 32.2mm wide on his ENVE SES 4.5 rims.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As with Jumbo-Visma, we don’t know if this is what Pogačar will run for every stage. He might switch over to narrower, lighter wheels and tyres for the mountain stages, for example.</p>\n<p>But it’s pretty wild to see tyres this wide being used for standard road stages at the Tour de France, and we suspect other teams will again be paying close attention to how they get on.</p>\n<h2>One bike to rule them all?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon Clarke's Factor O2 VAM\" title=\"Simon Clarke's Factor O2 VAM\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Simon Clarke’s new Factor O2 VAM – which weighed a feathery 6.925kg – was one of many lightweight-aero all-rounders we saw at this year’s Tour Grand Depart.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While we saw a smorgasbord of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-de-france-2022-tech-trends/\">heavyweight aero road bikes at last year’s Grand Depart</a>, this year it was all about the lightweight-aero all-rounders.</p>\n<p>Of course, that’s perhaps unsurprising given this year’s opening stages around Bilbao, Spain, were significantly hillier than those around Copenhagen, Denmark, where last year’s race started.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Caleb Ewan's prototype Ridley\" title=\"Caleb Ewan's prototype Ridley\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Caleb Ewan was also riding a prototype Ridley, which, at 7.5kg, was around 300g lighter than the Ridley Noah Fast he used last year.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The influx of a number of new bikes in this niche, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-factor-o2-vam/\">new Factor O2 VAM</a>, a new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/caleb-ewan-ridley-prototype/\">prototype Ridley</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-look-795-blade-rs/\">Look 795 Blade RS</a> shows that many riders at the pointy end of the sport are still chasing those last few hundreds of grams.</p>\n<p>Of course, we also know – thanks to the frequent comments we receive on the topic – that many outside of the pro peloton care a lot about bike weight too.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ben O'Connor's prototype BMC aero road bike\" title=\"Ben O'Connor's prototype BMC aero road bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ben O’Connor’s prototype BMC aero road bike looked fairly hefty but was, at 7.345kg, surprisingly light.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Is this just bike brands waking up to consumer demand then?
