It is, by far, the most popular watch of any kind in the world. Over different generations Apple has added features such as GPS, LTE, and weatherproofing that make the Apple Watch ever more a standalone device in its own right. But is it possible to untether it from the iPhone entirely?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we explain what exactly an Apple Watch can achieve without the assistance of an iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"3210\" height=\"2140\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm)\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3210w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-hero.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MW-Ed-Choice-90x90-1.png\" alt=\"Editors' Choice\" loading=\"lazy\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2478899/apple-watch-series-10-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$399\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ5KQL7?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$367 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-42mm-Jet-Black-Aluminum-Case-with-Black-Sport-Band-S-M/11385157008\" target=\"_blank\">$369 at  Walmart Electronics</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6572674/pdp\" target=\"_blank\">$379 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>Can you use an Apple Watch without an iPhone?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes and no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you first get an Apple Watch, it <em>requires</em> an iPhone to set it up. There’s no getting around that. The Watch app on the iPhone does most of the heavy lifting, and without it you just have a pretty bracelet that cost far too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without an iPhone you won’t be able to set up the Apple Watch. Apple regards the Apple Watch as a companion device to its smartphone, so much so that you can’t even use a Mac or iPad to help get it up and running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why did we say “yes and no”, rather than just “no”? Well, although you can’t set up an Apple Watch without an iPhone, you can set up an Apple Watch for someone who doesn’t have an iPhone–a child or another family member–using your iPhone. They will still be able to use many of the features of the Apple Watch. You will need an Apple ID and you’ll need to add them to your Family Sharing Group, and their Apple Watch needs to be connected to the internet to take full advantage–although this doesn’t need to be a cellular connection as the Apple Watch only needs to be able to connect to a Wi-Fi network to send or receive data. The only times they will need to be in range of your iPhone update the software on their Apple Watch and to tweak a few specific settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, you can still enjoy plenty of features on your own Apple Watch even if you left your iPhone at home. We’ll run through the things your Apple Watch doesn’t need an iPhone for below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Does Fall Detection/ Crash Detection on Apple Watch work without cellular/iPhone? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are thinking of purchasing an Apple Watch for an elderly parent because the Fall Detection feature could give you peace of mind, you may be wondering whether it will work without an iPhone nearby, or at least a cellular connection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the crash detection feature may appeal. But what if you don’t have a phone nearby, or a WiFi connection, when it happens?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These features require Apple Watch Series 8 (or later), Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), and Apple Watch Ultra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Apple Watch can contact emergency services if it detects that you have been in a car crash, or fallen over, but it does need to either be on a cellular network, or connected to a Wi-Fi network to place the call.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://fm-idg-picky.s3.amazonaws.com/polly_images/1.714082.1549283889!imageUploader/2131360223_x_980.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Watch upptäcker fall\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What an Apple Watch can do without an iPhone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all things that an Apple Watch can do without requiring you to have an iPhone in your pocket. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, your Apple Watch will require a connection to a Wi-Fi network or cellular. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Track Activity and Workouts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to close your rings, but don’t fancy dragging your iPhone out on a run or long walk? The Apple Watch will happily record all of those steps and other health information while out and about. The data will sync with your iPhone when you return home.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3803257/does_apple_watch_work_without_iphone_workout_thumb.png\" alt=\"Does Apple Watch work without iPhone: Activity Tracking\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Use other Health features </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you have no iPhone, Wi-Fi, or cellular connection, you can still use the following Apple Watch features: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Check heart rate (all models)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Take an ECG (Apple Watch Series 4 or later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Measure your blood oxygen (Apple Watch Series 6 or later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Track sleep (Apple Watch Series 3 or later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Track medications (Apple Watch Series 4 or later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Track menstrual cycle (Apple Watch Series 1 or later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use the stopwatch, set alarms and timers</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Listen to music</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want some pumping tunes while running or just fancy listening to a podcast or album while you potter about in the garden, then you can store plenty of tracks on the Apple Watch itself, all of which you can listen to without the need for an iPhone. Of course, as there is no headphone jack on an Apple Watch, you’ll need a pair of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668628/best-earbuds-for-iphone.html\">Bluetooth headphones</a> – unless you want the tiny little speaker to ruin your exercise session and relationship with the neighbors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also stream music from Apple Music – if you are connected to Wi-Fi or have a cellular connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672735/how-to-use-bluetooth-headphones-with-an-apple-watch.html\">how to use Bluetooth headphones with an Apple Watch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671638/how-to-play-music-on-an-apple-watch.html\">how to play music on Apple Watch</a> separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Listen to podcasts and audiobooks </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have synced podcasts and audiobooks with your Apple Watch you will be able to listen to them even if there is no Wi-Fi or cellular connection. And if you can connect to a Wi-Fi or cellular network then you can stream them too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Read news </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another one you will need a Wi-Fi or cellular connection for, but even without your iPhone nearby you can still check the latest stories on the News app, or track stocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Make and receive phone calls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an Apple Watch Series 3 or later with cellular capabilities or are connected to a Wi-Fi network, you can set up the Watch to act as an extension of your iPhone. With this in place, you’ll then be able to make and receive calls directly on your Watch, even if your iPhone is in a drawer back home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are additional costs to using the eSIM feature, but you’ll find them far less onerous than the normal plans offered by carriers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671600/how-to-make-or-answer-a-phone-call-on-apple-watch.html\">How to make or answer a phone call on Apple Watch</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Send and receive text messages </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As with phone calls, as long as you are connected to Wi-Fi or cellular data you will be able to send and receive messages on your Apple Watch. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Read and send emails and view your calendar</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The same is true of emails – as long as you are on a Wi-Fi or cellular network you don’t require your iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Look at photos </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sync your favorite photos and you can look at them on your Watch whenever you like. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Use Maps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another very useful feature that’s available on an Apple Watch is the ability to use the Apple Maps app without an iPhone nearby. Again, this will require a cellular contract or a Wi-Fi connection. With that in place, you’re free to roam without an expensive and heavy iPhone-shaped bulk in your pocket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671636/how-to-use-maps-on-apple-watch.html\">how to use Apple Maps on Apple Watch</a> for all you need to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use the Compass to work out which way is north without needing any network connection.  </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3804225/como_usar_mapas_en_apple_watch_principal.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple Watch Maps\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Use Apple Pay</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You might not realize it, but once you’ve set up Apple Pay on your Apple Watch, there’s no need to have your iPhone with you when paying for things at the checkout. Just double-press the Side button and hold the Watch over the contactless sensor, and the payment should go through automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t used this feature yet, then a quick read of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671322/how-to-use-apple-pay-on-an-apple-watch.html\">how to use Apple Pay on Apple Watch</a> will speed up those moments at the checkout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also be able to load up transit cards and ID cards on your Apple Watch. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can you use an Apple Watch with an Android phone?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No. If Apple doesn’t want the Watch working with iPads and Macs, then you can be assured that Android phones are well down the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s possible that Apple sees the Watch as a system-seller, in that people will stick with the iPhone just to use the Apple Watch. There’s no great temptation for the company to open up the devices to new platforms any time soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve yet to take the plunge on an Apple Watch or need to update your existing model to take advantage of some of the features listed above, be sure to check out <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671574/best-apple-watch.html\">best Apple Watch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672795/best-apple-watch-deals-available-this-april.html\">best Apple Watch deals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6476152c465f4e118f6db1506dc71eaa9d49cf9c52397c8ffd98e877ad4ca1a5","category":"Apple"}
