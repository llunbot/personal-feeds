Because they were released lower than expected—about 135 km above the Earth's surface and subject to atmospheric drag—these satellites ultimately reentered the planet's atmosphere and burnt up.</p>\n<p>Typically, after a launch failure, a rocket will be sidelined for months while engineers and technicians comb over the available data and debris to identify a cause, perform tests, and institute a fix.</p>\n<p>However, according to multiple sources, SpaceX was ready to launch the Falcon 9 rocket as soon as late last week. Currently, the company has a launch opportunity for no earlier than 12:14 am ET (04:14 UTC) on Wednesday for its Starlink 10-4 mission.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038295#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038295&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"de44047ee84e5750657ce4907bbca2c9197e799edb816ef8bef5da305fb91ad7","category":"Tech"}
