On Thursday, Meta <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/code-llama-ai-for-coding/\">unveiled</a> \"Code Llama,\" a new large language model (LLM) based on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/meta-launches-llama-2-an-open-source-ai-model-that-allows-commercial-applications/\">Llama 2</a> that is designed to assist programmers by generating and debugging code. It aims to make software development more efficient and accessible, and it's free for commercial and research use.</p>\n\n<p>Much like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/\">ChatGPT</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/about-github-copilot-chat\">GitHub Copilot Chat</a>, you can ask Code Llama to write code using high-level instructions, such as \"Write me a function that outputs the Fibonacci sequence.\" Or it can assist with debugging if you provide a sample of problematic code and ask for corrections.</p>\n<p>As an extension of Llama 2 (released <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/meta-launches-llama-2-an-open-source-ai-model-that-allows-commercial-applications/\">in July</a>), Code Llama builds off of weights-available LLMs Meta has been developing since <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/chatgpt-on-your-pc-meta-unveils-new-ai-model-that-can-run-on-a-single-gpu/\">February</a>. Code Llama has been specifically trained on source code data sets and can operate on various programming languages, including Python, Java, C++,  PHP, TypeScript, C#, Bash scripting, and more.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963185#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963185&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"95cfe2797e5d593bd1879c5e17daa24cad1af30719d1825530912b4e14d3e799","category":"Tech"}
