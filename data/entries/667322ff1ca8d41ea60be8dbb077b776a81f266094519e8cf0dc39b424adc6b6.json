All versions of Windows 11 are affected, plus all currently supported versions of Windows 10; Windows Server versions going back to 2012 can also be affected.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft continues to look into the issue, but in an update posted yesterday, the company stated unambiguously that HP was not to blame. The company also says that most printers should continue to work fine, and that they \"will continue to use the expected drivers for printer operations.\" But if your printer relies on a third-party app for additional functionality, that may be broken.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989738#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989738&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"667322ff1ca8d41ea60be8dbb077b776a81f266094519e8cf0dc39b424adc6b6","category":"Tech"}
