However, macOS isn’t foolproof and you shouldn’t be too lax about protecting your investment.

You might think that there is no need to password-protect your Mac if you’re only going to be using it at home, but there are various reasons why you need this layer of protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one thing, without a password on your Mac, nothing on your Mac is secure and someone could gain access to your email, photos, and more. macOS has a number of security features that keep your data safe, but if someone gets past your login screen, they can still gain access to sensitive information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose your password during setup, but if you haven’t—or just want to change the one you picked—here’s how:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS Ventura and later </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open System Settings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select <em>Touch ID &amp; Password</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can now set up a password or change your existing password to something safer.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If your Mac has Touch ID, you can also enter multiple fingerprints and select which can be used for Apple Pay and other purchases, and auto-filling passwords.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS Monterey or earlier</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open System Preferences.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select <em>Security &amp; Privacy</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click <em>General</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can now set up a password or change your existing password.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you choose a sensible password that won’t be easily guessed as your Mac can also be used as part of Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/229795/how-to-set-up-two-factor-authentication-for-your-apple-id-and-icloud-account.html\">two-factor authentication</a> for iCloud.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Change your Lock Screen settings</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Set-screen-scaver-mac.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Set up screen saver Mac\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>You can set your Mac display to turn off when inactive after some time, which will not only protect your data, it will also save power if you are running on battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you select the amount of time you are happy to leave your Mac unprotected keep in mind that if the screen saver doesn’t start for half an hour and then your Mac waits another 15 minutes before requiring a password, your Mac will be unprotected for 45 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To choose the length of time you are willing to let pass before having to enter the password after the screen saver starts or the screen turns off, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS Ventura</strong> <strong>and later</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open System Settings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on <em>Lock Screen</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select “Start screen saver when inactive” and choose 10 minutes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select “Turn display off when inactive” we recommend you choose 10 minutes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select “Require password after the screen saver begins or display is turned off” and choose 5 minutes.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS Monterey or older</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open System Preferences.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on <em>Battery</em> (MacBook) or <em>Energy Saver</em> (desktop).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On a MacBook, click <em>Battery</em> and select 10 minutes using the “Turn the display off after” slider.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On a desktop, click on <em>Power Adapter</em> and select 10 minutes using the “Turn the display off after” slider.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go to <em>Security &amp; Privac</em>y and beside “Require password after sleep or screen saver begins,” choose 5 minutes.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In both cases, this will mean your Mac is locked down after 15 minutes of inactivity.
