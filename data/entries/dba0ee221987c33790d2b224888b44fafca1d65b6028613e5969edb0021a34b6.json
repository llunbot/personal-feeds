The result is an uptick in calls to poison control centers, empty shelves in farming supply stores, and pleas from regulators.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1429050070243192839\">an attention-grabbing tweet</a> over the weekend, the Food and Drug Administration wrote bluntly: \"You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it.\"</p>\n<p>The agency stressed that the drug, ivermectin, is not FDA-approved to treat or prevent COVID-19 and, so far, there is no evidence that it does either of those things. However, it can cause serious side effects and overdoses, which can be life-threatening, the agency warned. Overdoses can result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension (low blood pressure), allergic reactions (itching and hives), dizziness, ataxia (problems with balance), seizures, coma, and even death.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790157#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790157&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dba0ee221987c33790d2b224888b44fafca1d65b6028613e5969edb0021a34b6","category":"Tech"}
