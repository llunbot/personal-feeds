The frame itself is built around mountain bike standards, including a full 100mm travel mountain bike suspension fork and boost spacing. The Wanderer is built specifically around the SmartShift, Pinion’s electronically shifted gearbox.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/TRP-Detail-Shot.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/TRP-Detail-Shot.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/TRP-Detail-Shot.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/TRP-Detail-Shot.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/TRP-Detail-Shot.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/SmartShift-Detail-Shot.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/SmartShift-Detail-Shot.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/SmartShift-Detail-Shot.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/SmartShift-Detail-Shot.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/SmartShift-Detail-Shot.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>TRP has stepped up to the plate with the Hywire, a drop bar shifter/lever (the brifter) combo designed around the Smartshift that allows for a proper shifting experience with drop bars and the Pinion gearbox. Worried about battery life for electronic shifting? Pinion claims a full 10,000 shifts per charge, making the SmartShift charging a non-issue for all but the longest of adventures.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Wanderer-Drive-Side-Profile-SID-SL.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Wanderer-Drive-Side-Profile-SID-SL.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Wanderer-Drive-Side-Profile-SID-SL.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Wanderer-Drive-Side-Profile-SID-SL.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Wanderer-Drive-Side-Profile-SID-SL.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The Wanderer also pushes the boundaries of gravel or adventure bike geometry. With a slack 67.5 ̊ head tube angle and long front center, Viral aims to push the wheelbase and reach of the Wanderer for more stability and confidence-inspiring descending, loaded or not. In addition, Viral is changing the game in terms of size-specific geometry, concentrating on the seat tube angle vs. size-specific chainstay lengths.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/BB-Passive-Suspension-and-Head-Tube-Detail-Shots.jpg?fit=1200,800&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/BB-Passive-Suspension-and-Head-Tube-Detail-Shots.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/BB-Passive-Suspension-and-Head-Tube-Detail-Shots.jpg?resize=1200,480&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/BB-Passive-Suspension-and-Head-Tube-Detail-Shots.jpg?resize=768,307&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/BB-Passive-Suspension-and-Head-Tube-Detail-Shots.jpg?resize=1536,614&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Instead, the new Wanderer puts larger riders AND smaller riders more forward on the bike, with a steeper seat tube angle, to accomplish the same thing as longer chainstays would.  The Wanderer also has a unique seat cluster up its sleeve, which de-couples the top tube from the seat tube and uses a titanium spring plate welded to the seat stays to support the rider. This offers between 10-20mm of flex to the seat tube, giving the rider even more comfort and control over the rough stuff.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Wanderer-Drive-Side-Profile-Carbon-Boost.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Wanderer-Drive-Side-Profile-Carbon-Boost.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Wanderer-Drive-Side-Profile-Carbon-Boost.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Wanderer-Drive-Side-Profile-Carbon-Boost.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/Wanderer-Drive-Side-Profile-Carbon-Boost.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The Wanderer frame kit ($5995) will come with a frame, the Pinion C1.12i Smartshift gearbox, forged cranks, battery, charger, wiring, and a full TRP Hywire brake set with 180mm rotors front and rear (either 6-bolt or center lock rotors are available).It will also come with a Gates CDX cogs and belt, the Pinion cog lock ring tool, and the first 6,000-mile oil change kit.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://viral.bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Viral Bikes</a>.</p>\n<p><em> For the Pre-Order special, a half-down deposit will get you the TRP brifters for free, so the frame kit will be $5495.
