The information coincides with the release of a paper in Nature that provides evidence that Microsoft's hardware can actually measure the behavior of a specific hypothesized quasiparticle.</p>\n<p>Separately from that, the company announced that it has built hardware that uses these quasiparticles as the foundation for a new type of qubit, one that Microsoft is betting will allow it to overcome the advantages of companies that have been producing qubits for years.</p>\n<h2>The zero mode</h2>\n<p>Quasiparticles are collections of particles (and, in some cases, field lines) that can be described mathematically as if they were a single particle with properties that are distinct from their constituents. The best-known of these are probably the Cooper pairs that electrons form in superconducting materials.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/microsoft-builds-its-first-qubits-lays-out-roadmap-for-quantum-computing/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/microsoft-builds-its-first-qubits-lays-out-roadmap-for-quantum-computing/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2968c7becb09bb626892b5f3c881a22b155a98813fd1404442fd221abe1e6e56","category":"Tech"}
