It just so happens that this Belkin type-C cable can put out 240W power delivery, which is enough to charge even the power-hungry 16-inch MacBook Pro laptops (with a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-140W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B09JR6DBFH/\">140W power adapter</a>). You can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CB83QY4L?th=1\">get one of these for $15 right now</a>, a 25 percent discount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The superfast cable is 6.6 feet long, which is particularly fantastic for those who like moving around while their phone charges. Or, if, like me, you hate laying on the very edge of the bed for those last daily minutes of doomscrolling, a cable of this length will also give you the freedom of movement you need. The cable is built with durability in mind, from the anodized aluminum head to the double-braided nylon cable that’s bound to resist thousands of bends and plug-ins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Belkin BoostCharge USB-C cable’s 240W power delivery, however, is the best part because it makes it highly versatile, allowing you to charge everything from smartphones to tablets to laptops.
