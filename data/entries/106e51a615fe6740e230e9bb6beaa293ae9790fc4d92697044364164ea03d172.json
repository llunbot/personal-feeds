I had been at a bar with a small group one freezing winter night in 2012 in Buffalo, New York. One of us, eager to share his recent obsession, declared it was time for the outing's next stage. We went to his barely unpacked new apartment nearby. He pulled the game from a plastic tote, opened it on a wobbly dinette table, and laid out the board, apologizing for the moisture-warped edges. I took a picture (on my HTC Thunderbolt) because, having had a few, I wanted to ensure I'd remember this game with the wooden pieces and weird amount of sheep.</p>\n<p></p><div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/catan4.jpg\"><img alt=\"&lt;em&gt;Settlers of Catan&lt;/em&gt;, as I saw it in early 2012.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/catan4-300x300.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/catan4-640x640.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/catan4.jpg\"><em>Settlers of Catan</em>, as I saw it in early 2012.</a> (credit: Kevin Purdy)</p></div>It was an inauspicious start to the rest of my board gaming life. Growing up in the '80s and '90s, then starting my young adult life in the early 2000s, I'd regarded board games as something you do in situations where you can't do anything else: power outages, cabins in the woods, gatherings with people without known shared interests. They weren't really going to be <em>fun</em>, and you wouldn't necessarily <em>play</em> them, but someone would get to be the winner, and time would pass. <em>Catan</em> changed that—for me and for what are now legions of modern board game enthusiasts.\n<h2>From a German basement to 32 million copies</h2>\n<p>You may have seen <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/04/05/klaus-teuber-catan-game-dies/\">the news this week</a> that Klaus Teuber, the German designer who created <em>The </em><em>Settlers of Catan (</em>now just <em>Catan</em>), died on April 1 at age 70. Teuber developed <em>Die Siedler von Catan</em> in the early 1990s, playing with ideas of Icelandic settlements, tinkering in his basement while working full-time at a dental lab. He'd bring up new iterations for his wife and kids to test every weekend, he told <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-man-who-built-catan\">The New Yorker</a>. The breakthrough, he said, was using hexagonal tiles instead of squares.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929865#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929865&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"106e51a615fe6740e230e9bb6beaa293ae9790fc4d92697044364164ea03d172","category":"Tech"}
