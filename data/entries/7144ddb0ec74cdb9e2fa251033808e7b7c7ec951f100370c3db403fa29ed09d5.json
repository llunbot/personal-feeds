And it looks like there’s more where that came from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman, a tech pundit and leaker with a considerable following and decent predictive track record, claimed in a post Monday on X (formerly Twitter) that many Apple stores are currently experiencing stock shortages for the current iPad mini “in several configs.” Given the famously efficient nature of Apple’s logistics operation, such a widespread breakdown in supply–affecting multiple versions of a device at multiple locations–is often a sign that the company is deliberately winding down production ahead of the launch of a new model.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Many Apple stores are low on stock of the iPad mini in several configs, while the device is considered “constrained” internally within Apple, I’m told. That *could* be a sign a new one is coming. It hasn’t been updated since 2021. Wouldn’t be surprised to see it updated for AI.</p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1828188631015792709?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 26, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not before time, too. As Gurman points out, the iPad mini hasn’t been updated since 2021, and we’re coming up fast on the device’s third birthday, which is rather alarming. There was a time (across the first four generations of the product) when the mini got an update every fall like the iPhone, but even by later standards we’re due for it to be either refreshed or discontinued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be fair a three-year interval between launches is not unprecedented. There was a wait of three and a half years between the fourth- and fifth-gen models. But then too a lot of us wondered if Apple had given up on the idea. But a haphazard iPad mini upgrade cycle is somewhat par for the course:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad mini 6: Sept 2021</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini 5: March 2019</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini 4: Sept 2015</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini 3: Oct 2014</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini 2: Oct 2013</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini: Oct 2012</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The long gap since the device last got an update makes the mini a deeply unappealing purchase right now. It still runs an A-class processor whereas even the iPad Air (which at one time was in many respects a larger equivalent of the mini) is two generations into M-class Mac chips. Unlike the other iPads, the mini still has its front-facing camera on the short edge as well, which I described recently as a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2262063/2024-ipad-air-pro-camera-landscape-orientation.html\">13-year-old design error</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman says he wouldn’t be surprised if the iPad mini gets an update to make it compatible with Apple Intelligence, which means an upgrade from 4GB to 8GB of RAM as well, but to be honest that’s the least of its worries. Notably, the iPad mini doesn’t support the newest Apple Pencil Pro or any version of the Magic Keyboard and starts at a feeble 64GB of storage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep up with all the latest news and rumors about the new device, check out our regularly updated <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">iPad mini 7 superguide</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7144ddb0ec74cdb9e2fa251033808e7b7c7ec951f100370c3db403fa29ed09d5","category":"Apple"}
