Our sights were set on Santa Fe, where her family has roots and where my dream of riding to endless singletrack from my front door would be realized. A city of 80,000 people, with lots of bike infrastructure (for New Mexico, anyway,) meant we could spend less time in our car and more time pedaling around. We bought a house in late 2019 and moved to the Southwestern state just before the pandemic hit.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-6.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-6.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-6.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-6.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-6.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-6.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Since living here, we went from using cars frequently in Los Angeles to being “car-lite,” yet I wanted to be even <em>lighter</em>. While running to the grocery store or our neighborhood co-op was fine on a basket or touring bike, when we had to buy a week’s worth of food, go to the hardware store, or plant nursery, we would hit the limits of what our analog bikes (and legs) could carry. Cari has <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/caris-elephant-nfe-is-a-do-it-all-basket-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">her Elephant NFE</a>, and I have <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/rivendell-bombadil-review/\" target=\"_blank\">my Rivendell Bombadil</a> for such outings. While I’m a strong enough rider that an extra thirty pounds worth of groceries/supplies/etc. doesn’t break me, outings like this were challenging for Cari, a much more casual cyclist.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1602\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-54.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-54.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-54.jpg?resize=1024,820&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-54.jpg?resize=768,615&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-54.jpg?resize=1800,1442&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-54.jpg?resize=1335,1069&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-54.jpg?resize=700,561&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-54.jpg?resize=1536,1230&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1602\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-84.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-84.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-84.jpg?resize=1024,820&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-84.jpg?resize=768,615&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-84.jpg?resize=1800,1442&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-84.jpg?resize=1335,1069&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-84.jpg?resize=700,561&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RecentRoll120_NYE22-84.jpg?resize=1536,1230&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Then this past winter, we linked up with my longtime friends Erik and Sofia Nohlin in the Mojave Desert. Erik and I go way back. <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/recent-roll-hellhommus/\" target=\"_blank\">Over ten years</a>, if I recall correctly. He’s been working at Specialized just as long, and last year, he took over the Globe Bikes initiative. Globe has gone through various permutations over the years, with its most current being pedal-assist, Class III cargo e-bikes. We chatted about the potential for e-cargo applications in American cities, their implications on the health of Americans, and how when it comes to e-bikes, they are, at least to me, the most practical use case scenario to justify a motor on a bicycle.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a few months into 2023, Cari and I found ourselves with a delivery of a Globe Haul ST bike in olive drab (of course), with a slew of Fjallraven accessories tailored toward making this e-assist cargo bike a supplement to our car. As I mentioned, we only use the car–Cari’s 2001 Tacoma she bought new–to haul big loads of wood/mulch/gravel, drop off review bikes to UPS, and do big grocery store runs. We’re happy to pedal our bikes around town for regular, day-to-day needs.</p>\n<p>Before we dive further in, let’s outline what the Globe Haul ST is; then, we’ll discuss why we love this bike, its faults, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/health/ebikes-safety-teens.html\" target=\"_blank\">the spread of misinformation by media</a> over e-bikes’ role in urban transport.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-16.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-16.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-16.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-16.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-16.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-16.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-16.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-16.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Globe Haul ST $2,800/77 lbs/One Size</h3>\n<p>While most of you will be familiar with the modus operandi of mini e-cargo bikes like the Haul, let me break it down.</p>\n<p>As Globe states:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“With 419 pounds of cargo capacity (rider included) [and] up to 60 miles at a time, this fully customizable electric bike has the speed, power, range, and stability to get you wherever you need to go with whatever you need. With plenty of optional cargo mounting opportunities you can bring the kids, a kayak, and stop on the way home for groceries. Don’t sweat it getting dark on you either. Integrated front and rear lights will have you dialed from dawn patrol to golden hour.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-21.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-35.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-35.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-35.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-35.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-35.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-26.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-26.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-26.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-26.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-26.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-26.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-26.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-26.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>700w rear hub motor delivers enough power to get you and all your gear up steep hills and all the way across town at top speed.

Class III e-bikes are equipped with a speedometer (mounted to the computer terminal on the handlebar) and only assist in speed until the bike reaches 28mph. The assist is instantaneous as long as you pedal. If you stop pedaling, the bike stops being propelled by the motor. This is the main distinction between a Class III e-bike and a Class II, which is more akin to an electronic moped with a hand throttle–Class I is strictly pedal assist limited to 20 mph.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-44.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-44.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-44.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-44.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-44.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-44.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-44.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-44.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>The Big Motor propels the Globe and is fully encased in the rear hub…</em></p>\n<p>The Globe ST’s computer terminal lets you select from 1-5 for the assist speed. We keep ours set around 2-3 and mostly take surface streets, not bike paths, for our errands (bike paths here are full of off-leash dogs and elderly people who are hard of hearing, so it’s easier just to take neighborhood surface streets.) In doing so, we can get about a week’s worth of use from a single charge; around 50-60 miles.</p>\n<p><em>Initially, we were rolling the bike indoors at night, but since it’s so heavy (77 lbs), we found it cumbersome. Even just getting it up three stairs was too much for Cari to do alone.

There are even <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/shop/equipment/gear/globe-passenger-kit/c/globe-passenger-kit\" target=\"_blank\">kiddo hauler attachments</a> if you need to take your kid to school on the Haul ST.

When we first got the bike (which arrived completely assembled, sans the handlebar) we figured out a handlebar angle that worked for both Cari and myself and a stem extension. Here, we have 5cm exposed on the stem, and we hard-clamped the bottom half of the telescoping seat post at the 6cm extension mark. This allows for the quick-release extension of the seatpost to be set between my saddle height and Cari’s.</p>\n<p>This might seem like a pain to do each time, but we have an easy hack to solve this problem: I simply scored the seatpost with a scribe at Cari’s and my preferred height. Then I can quickly set it up on the fly without having to measure for proper leg extension.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-38.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-38.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-38.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-38.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-38.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-38.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-38.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-38.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>It’s important to note that the extra thickness of the Carless Whisper tires (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izGwDsrQ1eQ\" target=\"_blank\">great name</a>!) to avoid flats from thorns/glass/debris means that dialing in the tire pressure is essential for achieving the best ride quality.

We keep the derailleur in the tallest gear for our around-town errands. Even when Cari hauls a load from the plant nursery up to her mom’s condo, 600′ above town, she still keeps the same gearing.</p>\n<p><em>Which leads us to the question: why aren’t these pedal-assist e-cargo bikes singlespeed?

The color is a limited run, in stock, and available today from Globe. If you know me and my aesthetic tendencies, then you know this bike hits my heart in all the right ways!</p>\n<p>Regarding the “issues,” yes, we had to take this bike to a local Specialized dealer to get the recall handled. It took two weeks for the shop to fix the hardware malfunction (the assembly facility loaded the terminal connections with dielectric grease, which caused error codes and intermittent battery failure.) The repair was handled promptly (for a small mountain town’s shop queue) and cost us nothing. Things happen. Much like in automobiles, the first generation of equipment often has issues. Yet, Specialized rolled out an official recall notice to dealers, and even in my anecdotal correspondence with other Globe Haul ST owners, the consensus is it was a mild inconvenience but was handled quickly.</p>\n<p>This brings about a crucial point in the discussion of e-cargo and e-assist bikes in general: they are electronic and can suffer ailments occasionally. This is why it’s crucial to buy from a brand long established in the bike industry, not a no-name, cheap bike from online resellers. Specialized ain’t going anywhere, nor is Globe (we hope not!), so having a dealer network that can work on your bike and firmware updates rolling out is important for the longevity of the bike. Most bike shops hate working on no-name e-bikes. When it’s a specific dealer, they have no choice. :-)</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-66.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-66.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-66.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-66.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-66.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-66.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-66.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-66.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Cari’s Review Within the Review</h3>\n<p><em>Cari’s editorial debut on The Radavist (she designs all of our merch and our graphics)!</em></p>\n<p>A few days ago, John and I had just finished a big grocery run, me on the Globe and him on his Riv, and he commented that he “really has to work” to keep up with me around town.

Riding up streets for no reason other than to see what is on the other side: that <em>kid again</em> feeling.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-72.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-72.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-72.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-72.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-72.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-72.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-72.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-72.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Exhibit B:</strong> Windy AF? No problem. I try to do most errands on my basket bike, and I’m a somewhat fair-weather cyclist. Let’s be honest, I’m a fair-weather person when it comes to almost any sport. So I’ve found the Globe to be indispensable when the following excuses not to ride my bike are true:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s too GD windy. Life at 7000′ has its drawbacks!</li>\n<li>Whatever I need to get is too big or too heavy for my basket bike (see Exhibit C.)</li>\n<li>Errand place is farther than I’m in the mood for.</li>\n<li>I just feel like a turd.</li>\n<li>I want to go somewhere and not be all sweaty when I get there.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And talk about being in a better mood after running errands on a bike vs. sitting in a stupid car! It’s not news to any cycling folk, but the mood enhancement after a simple jaunt to Ace Hardware is next level.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-67.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-67.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-67.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-67.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-67.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-67.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-67.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-67.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Exhibit C:</strong> The fun of figuring out how to fit weird shit on the bike.

This thing is definitely much heavier than my basket bike, and you can’t just whip it around to put it on the bike rack. Getting the kickstand down also takes a little muscle. I’m 5’7”/130lbs with some decent pipes, and sometimes I still struggle a little bit to get it down, but either my skills are improving or the kickstand has loosened up a bit (prob the latter) because I have noticed it seems a bit easier.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-74.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-74.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-74.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-74.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-74.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-74.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-74.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-74.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-75.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-75.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-75.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-75.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-75.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-75.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-75.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-75.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>While riding with the wind blowing through your hair is the damn dream, I do find the wind noise in my ears to be slightly disconcerting.

Both my own projects and review bikes on loan from various companies, but none have garnered more interactions than the Globe Haul ST. Santa Fe’s population is strange. It tends to be primarily retirees, with young people sprinkled in and a lot of machismo in the form of large pickup trucks and muscle cars driving erratically.  (This is an oversimplification based on my interactions, not a complete demographic poll.) The collision of these groups is entertaining.</p>\n<p>Let me tell you. Put a 6’2″ white dude on this bike, and you will get some heckling from the aforementioned macho bros. I have gotten called any number of names from this crowd, had shit thrown at me from passing pickup trucks, and had drivers act aggressively toward me while riding it (like brake checking me on neighborhood streets, or passing unsafely.) Meanwhile, Cari hasn’t had any such interactions. Bear in mind, I never get this aggressive treatment while on my bright yellow Rivendell or mountain bikes. Yet there is something about an e-bike like the Haul ST that really brings it out in certain people.</p>\n<p><em>I should also note that I love vintage 4×4 Toyotas and have owned many over the years. My current car camping rig is an Australian Land Cruiser (that has been MIA all summer, as it is undergoing a lot of bodywork in a shop), further exemplifying that humans, and their identities, are not one-dimensional. TL;DR: I drive a truck that many would consider “redneck,” but I drive it very safely and only on long-distance road trips, generally speaking. I guess I wonder if these drivers would brake-check me like this if I were driving in my Land Cruiser?</em></p>\n<p>Then there are the inquisitive retirees, asking about it constantly. “Is it safe? How fast does it go? How expensive is it?” So many people’s interests are piqued by this bike, whereas my regular bikes never gain such inqueries. Yet, there have been several cases of angry, mostly older white folk with out-of-state plates who like to tell me that I’m going to get myself killed or that I need to slow down ( I always observe the speed limits.)</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-11.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-11.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-11.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-11.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-11.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I didn’t understand where this animosity came from until I read a piece by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/health/ebikes-safety-teens.html\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times that was so full of automobile-leaning propaganda</a> that I couldn’t finish reading it.

Cyclists are viewed as annoyances by other drivers. We’re villainized in TV shows, mocked in movies, and run down by impatient motorists. Every day when I leave my home to go on a MTB ride, I have to calmly center myself because I know by riding across town to the trails, I will have a negative interaction with a speeding, law-breaking motorist. Most of the time, it’s a by-product of them being distracted or speeding, not overtly-aggressive behavior like what I experience on the Globe. It’s just part of life. <em>Take a deep breath and just get to the trail, John. </em></p>\n<p>As I write this, I don’t want to frame an “us versus them” argument any more than they already exist on the internet.

Nor can I ever see America going in this direction.

Let’s get back to the brass tacks. Over the past few months, our lives have been transformed by our cargo e-bike. Cari and I use it more frequently than our car and rely only on our car for in-town trips related to large, infrequent cargo hauls. Our first cargo e-bike is the Globe Haul ST, sent to us by Globe’s designer Erik Nohlin, to test out. We’ve thoroughly enjoyed the Haul ST, even though its recall service took it away from us for two weeks, and have found it a permanent solution for reducing our car reliance regarding errands.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-76.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-76.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-76.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-76.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-76.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-76.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-76.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/Globe-Haul-ST-e-Bike-Review-76.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>While Cari pedals around on errands, I’ll sometimes catch a skitch off her saddle rails…</em></p>\n<p>The possibilities for cargo accouterment are endless, and I’ll continue to tweak it over time, trying out solutions for carrying things like bike boxes or a MTB to drop off at a bike shop for repairs. For now, loading up USPS boxes, plants, potting soil, and groceries has us stoked and fighting over who uses it!</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fast (28 mph)</li>\n<li>Maneuverable due to its small size</li>\n<li>Excuse-free riding; no matter how tired you are, it’s easy to pedal the Haul ST to the grocery store.</li>\n<li>Fits a wide range of riders</li>\n<li>1-5 speed control lets you dial in the amount of “effort” you want while riding.</li>\n<li>Expandable cargo solutions through bolt-on accessories</li>\n<li>Daytime running (solid, not blinking) lights are safe and provide more than enough beam for night rides.</li>\n<li>Great battery life *40-60 miles depending on speed.</li>\n<li>Hauls plenty of cargo with ease</li>\n<li>Olive drab paint looks great!</li>\n<li>Extensive dealer network support (lifetime warranty on the frame and a two-year e-system warranty)</li>\n<li>The battery is removable, easy to access, and replaceable.</li>\n<li>Carless Whisper tires are bombproof; we ride it through goat head thorns and glass all the time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>More pricey than other models out there. Yet, <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2023/08/07/why-have-car-repairs-gotten-so-expensive/\" target=\"_blank\">the cost of car repairs is on the rise,</a> so it might be justified in the long run.</li>\n<li>Bolt-on accessories add to this cost.</li>\n<li>Heavy, hard to roll up stairs or into doorways.</li>\n<li>The seatpost needs to be greased to keep it sliding smoothly. Ours got jammed up and marred by constantly raising and lowering it.</li>\n<li>Specialized has killed the Globe line before, so there is uncertainty if there will be long-term (10+ years) support in the form of replacement batteries or firmware issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>I’d like to thank Erik from <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/globe/c/globe?gclid=CjwKCAjw8symBhAqEiwAaTA__OlN_7vIQT47tONgaLRb2Nazki7lObJnO5863xkPXOArlYbAHTXnxxoCD4QQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">Globe</a> for setting us up with this bike for review. We’ll continue to use it daily, and I’ll be pushing its use into other aspects of life (e-cargo bike camping, anyone?) so expect to see our Globe Haul ST in future articles here at The Radavist.
