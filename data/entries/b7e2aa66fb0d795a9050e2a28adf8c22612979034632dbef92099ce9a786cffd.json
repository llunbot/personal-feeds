The people requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Their identities are known to Insider.</blockquote>At its original inception, Apple had hoped that HealthHabit would allow for experimentation of possible new health services. HealthHabit is one project part of Apple Health, a division within Apple that consists of hundreds of engineers, scientists, doctors, designers, and more that oversee Apple's health features, such as the ones inside the Apple Watch. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the cutback on staff and resources, the report notes that HealthHabit may continue internally at a much smaller scale or possibly shut down entirely. A <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/16/apple-primary-healthcare-service-wsj/\">report in June</a> by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> detailed how Apple has piloted the idea of launching a healthcare service based on a subscription model with \"Apple Doctors.\" That project, spearheaded by Dr. Sumbul Desai of Stanford University, has, however, stalled.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOver the past few years, Apple has continued to build health features into the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and Apple Watch. In the years to come, Apple is looking to expand the capability of the Apple Watch itself by adding new sensors, such as temperature, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/03/apple-watch-blood-pressure-glucose-alcohol/\">blood pressure, blood glucose, and blood alcohol monitoring</a>. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/businessinsider-com/\">businessinsider.com</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/19/apple-scaling-back-internal-health-project/\">Report: Apple Scaling Back Internal 'HealthHabit' Project for Employee Health Tracking and Coaching</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-scaling-back-internal-healthhabit-project-for-employee-health-tracking-and-coaching.2308031/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4t7BQpU0avc:NNXm6o89bJc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4t7BQpU0avc:NNXm6o89bJc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/4t7BQpU0avc\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b7e2aa66fb0d795a9050e2a28adf8c22612979034632dbef92099ce9a786cffd","category":"Apple"}
