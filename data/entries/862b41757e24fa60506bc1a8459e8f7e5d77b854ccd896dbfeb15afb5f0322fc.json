It shows marked improvement in grasping\nnuance, humor, and complex instructions, and is exceptional at\nwriting high-quality content with a natural, relatable tone.</p>\n\n<p>Claude 3.5 Sonnet operates at twice the speed of Claude 3 Opus.\nThis performance boost, combined with cost-effective pricing,\nmakes Claude 3.5 Sonnet ideal for complex tasks such as\ncontext-sensitive customer support and orchestrating multi-step\nworkflows.</p>\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/fed9cc193a14b84131812372d8d5857f8f304c52/Model_Card_Claude_3_Addendum.pdf\">internal agentic coding evaluation</a>, Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nsolved 64% of problems, outperforming Claude 3 Opus which solved\n38%. Our evaluation tests the model’s ability to fix a bug or add\nfunctionality to an open source codebase, given a natural language\ndescription of the desired improvement. When instructed and\n<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/tool-use-ga\">provided with the relevant tools</a>, Claude 3.5 Sonnet can\nindependently write, edit, and execute code with sophisticated\nreasoning and troubleshooting capabilities. It handles code\ntranslations with ease, making it particularly effective for\nupdating legacy applications and migrating codebases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ll take them with a grain of self-promoting salt, but the evaluation tests presented by Anthropic position Claude 3.5 Sonnet as equal to or better than ChatGPT-4o. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/20/regulation-altman\">Again</a>: I don’t think there’s a moat in this game.</p>\n\n<p>Also, from the bottom of the post, this interesting nugget:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One of the core constitutional principles that guides our AI model\ndevelopment is privacy. We do not train our generative models on\nuser-submitted data unless a user gives us explicit permission to\ndo so. To date we have not used any customer or user-submitted\ndata to train our generative models.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/linked/apple-details-its-ai-foundation-models-and-applebot-web-scraping/\">Even Apple can’t say that</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/20/claude-3-5-sonnet\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"862b41757e24fa60506bc1a8459e8f7e5d77b854ccd896dbfeb15afb5f0322fc","category":"Tech"}
