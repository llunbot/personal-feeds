All Amazon Prime content is available through the Mac app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPicture-in-Picture and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> are both supported features that work with Amazon's new app, and it supports in-app purchases for TV rentals and on-demand content as well as payment with an Amazon credit card that's already on file. Users can also take advantage of Amazon's Thursday Night Football and English Premier league where available.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a feature that will keep track of what users are watching and where they are in a TV series or movie so a show can be watched on one device and then picked up on another.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAmazon Prime Video is free and it is compatible with macOS Big Sur 11.4 and later.
