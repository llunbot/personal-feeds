While that might be an overstatement, they do promise to boost range and slash charging times, bringing zero-emissions vehicles that much closer to parity with their fossil fuel competition.</p>\n<p>Yet <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_battery\">solid-state batteries</a>, which use a solid electrolyte as opposed to a liquid or gel, remain <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/eternally-five-years-away-no-batteries-are-improving-under-your-nose/\" target=\"_blank\">just over the horizon</a>. Recently, they’ve started to look less like vaporware and more like a real product, and they will probably make their way into cars and trucks by the end of the decade. Still, that’s a timeline that gives competitors an opening.</p>\n<p>One of those competitors is a company called <a href=\"https://ses.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">SES</a>, which last week announced a new battery that promises to nearly double the energy density of today’s lithium-ion cells. The key was eliminating a piece of the battery that added weight and thickness—but to do so without introducing dangerous conditions that could lead to a fire.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811081#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811081&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bf8a47e305a90dde68ab2449ffd57875bc6f713531253865c8eb917facfc139a","category":"Tech"}
