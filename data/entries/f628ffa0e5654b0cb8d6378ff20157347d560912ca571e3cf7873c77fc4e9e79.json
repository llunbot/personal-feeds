He said the chip supports Wi-Fi 6E, which extends the capabilities of Wi-Fi 6 to the 6 GHz with a compatible router. This can contribute to faster Wi-Fi speeds and lower latency compared to Wi-Fi 6.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther potential changes coming with the next Apple TV include a newer A-series chip that offers faster performance than the current A15 Bionic chip, a starting price <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/\">as low as $99 in the U.S.</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/\">built-in camera</a> for FaceTime video calls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the HomePod mini, likely upgrades include a newer S-series chip for faster performance, improved sound quality, and fresh color options. The current HomePod mini was released in November 2020, and it uses the Apple Watch Series 5's S5 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBy launching these devices later in 2025, Apple would be leaving room for several other rumored product announcements earlier in the year, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/02/what-to-expect-from-2025-macbook-air/\">new versions of the MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/when-to-expect-new-iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/09/airtag-2-release-date/\">AirTag</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/ipad-11-rumored-specs/\">entry-level iPad</a>, and more.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/\">HomePod Mini 2 and New Apple TV Launch Timeframe Narrowed Down</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timeframe-narrowed-down.2447277/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f628ffa0e5654b0cb8d6378ff20157347d560912ca571e3cf7873c77fc4e9e79","category":"Apple"}
