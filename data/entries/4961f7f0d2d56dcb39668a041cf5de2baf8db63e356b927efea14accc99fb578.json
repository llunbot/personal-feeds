It could have been longer. Maybe there's a director's cut. Or, maybe this is the darned good launch of an entirely new film franchise, and this film is merely meant to set up the even more fully rounded sequel(s). Whatever the case, that's a decidedly better way to leave theaters than being bored, annoyed, or otherwise shaken out of a good moviegoing experience by bad writing, acting, and directing decisions.</p>\n<p><em>Shang-Chi </em>seems driven by an apparent top-down directive to fortify a new class of mystical superheroes while sticking to Marvel's guns of inclusion and fully rounded character development. The result is good news for anyone looking for a mix of refreshing surprises and comfort food in their superhero tentpole films. Plus, this superhero big screen debut delivers enough \"holy whoa\" moments to make any viewer feel like a kid again.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789087#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789087&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4961f7f0d2d56dcb39668a041cf5de2baf8db63e356b927efea14accc99fb578","category":"Tech"}
