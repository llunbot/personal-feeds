The tariffs could have a significant impact on Apple, as the company assembles the majority of iPhones in China, and products imported to the U.S. from China will be subject to a 54% tariff.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/2024-iPhone-Boxes-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1322\" height=\"744\" />\r<br />\niPhone prices could increase by up to 43% in the U.S. due to the tariffs, according to analysts at equity research firm Rosenblatt Securities (<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/will-trump-tariffs-make-apple-iphones-more-expensive-2025-04-03/\">via <em>Reuters</em></a>).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBased on that prediction, the top-of-the-line iPhone 16 Pro Max model with 1TB of storage could rise from $1,599 to nearly $2,300 in the U.S., should Apple actually follow through with raising prices by 43% to offset the cost of tariffs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the other end of the iPhone lineup, the most affordable iPhone 16e model would increase from $599 to just over $850 with a 43% price increase.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAn iPhone 16 Pro with 256GB of storage could rise from $999 to more than $1,400.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple would need to raise its prices by at least 30% on average, in order to offset the tariffs, according to Counterpoint Research's Neil Shah.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has yet to publicly comment on the tariffs, so it is unclear if the company will actually raise prices, or if it will get creative and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/03/kuo-on-how-apple-can-reduce-tariff-impact/\">find alternative ways</a> to offset the impact. It is also unclear if iPhone 16 models would increase in price, or if Apple would simply set higher prices on iPhone 17 models from the get-go later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's stock price is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/04/apple-shares-plunge-china-unveils-tariffs/\">down nearly 15%</a> since Trump announced the planned tariffs.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rosenblatt-securities/\">Rosenblatt Securities</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/04/2300-dollar-iphone/\">iPhones Could Cost Up to $2,300 in the U.S. Due to Tariffs, Analyst Says</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphones-could-cost-up-to-2-300-in-the-u-s-due-to-tariffs-analyst-says.2454687/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"863471dd32bc9d85bd23630e1c4dfee8058f1fa5f929577581cecb799a0f6af7","category":"Apple"}
