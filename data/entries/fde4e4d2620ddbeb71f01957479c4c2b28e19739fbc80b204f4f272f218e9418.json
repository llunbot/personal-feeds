Even if people haven’t bought an iPhone or Mac, Apple’s fast-growing Services division relies on pulling in new subscribers regardless of the device they’re using to subscribe.</p>\n<p>To that end, Apple announced today that it’s finally bringing an Apple TV+ app to Android devices for the first time since Apple TV+ launched in 2019. The app will work on all Android phones and tablets running Android 10 or newer and will be available today. The app will support both Apple TV+ subscriptions and subscriptions to <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/channel/tvs.sbd.7000\">Apple’s MLS Season Pass service</a> for soccer fans.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/apple-tv-crosses-enemy-lines-will-be-available-as-an-android-app-starting-today/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/apple-tv-crosses-enemy-lines-will-be-available-as-an-android-app-starting-today/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fde4e4d2620ddbeb71f01957479c4c2b28e19739fbc80b204f4f272f218e9418","category":"Tech"}
