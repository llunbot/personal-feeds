{"title":"Huge Sports Tech Amazon Deals List!","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/10/amazon-deals-sports-tracker.html","date":1728379978000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>It’s that time of year again, for the first round of sales going into the holidays. While I still expect we’ll see bigger deals as we get closer to Black Friday, there are some solid deals in here. The list below is constantly updated, especially later in the day as more deals go live (or, I find them buried deep in the caves). Still, below are my favorites thus far:</p>\n<p><strong>My Top 5 Favorite Deals:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>#1) <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09NMLVQ64?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=24836c89cce0f53992998675dee55c34&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">Garmin Epix for $399:</a> </strong>No surprise here, this is an incredible deal, especially given it got virtually all the Epix Pro software features. Sure, the Fenix 8 is out, but that’ll cost you nearly 3x this, and actually doesn’t have really anything in the way of new sports features (except scuba diving), and the new speaker/mic. (Update: This deal keeps disappearing/out of stock, but keeps coming back an hour or few later, over and over. Just keeping hitting refresh!).<br />\n<strong>#2) <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09WTTD27P?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=b8fa6c0aae8f073f762c23d85ecba018&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">Garmin Forerunner 955 for $319:</a> </strong>This is an awesome deal for a high-end multisport watch with mapping.<br />\n<strong>#3) <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D1XD1ZV3\">Apple AirPods Pro for $168:</a></strong> Interestingly, they dropped the price further mid-day from $188 to $168, and that seems to have done the trick to push this into the top 5. My go-to headphones for daily (and running) usage.<br />\n<strong>#4) <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09734C4CM?th=1\">Garmin Edge 1040 for $479:</a> </strong>Despite the new Edge 1050 coming out this summer, the Edge 1040 got virtually all the new features via software update already. Thus, this is a great deal.<br />\n<strong>#5) <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9FPHY6?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=a5595d1ecbd686aac8af8a856c41242d&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">iPad for $199:</a> </strong>Ya probably didn’t see this coming, but, going into indoor trainer season, my iPad’s get a workout running apps like Zwift, TrainerRoad, Rouvy, Indievelo, and many more. You don’t need a super fancy iPad for any of those apps, this does the trick perfectly.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To take advantage of Amazon Big Deal Days you simply need to be an Amazon Prime member. The good news is that you <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=70c21bdda0fc6e89345a9efb972c456f&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">can sign-up for the free trial</a> and cancel later if you don’t find value in it. Just hit up this giant banner below to do so:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays?discounts-widget=%2522%257B%255C%2522state%255C%2522%253A%257B%255C%2522refinementFilters%255C%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%252C%255C%2522version%255C%2522%253A1%257D%2522&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=0cbfd94ece0cfd1997eefce88f10d024&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/10/AmazonPrimeDealDays-720x179.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"179\" srcset=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/10/AmazonPrimeDealDays-720x179.png 720w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/10/AmazonPrimeDealDays-200x50.png 200w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/10/AmazonPrimeDealDays-1536x381.png 1536w, https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2024/10/AmazonPrimeDealDays.png 1990w\" /></a></p>\n<p>I’ve organized all the best sports technology Amazon Prime Days deals (and a few others I’ve found) below in the tables by category. I’ll be updating them throughout the next two days. <strong>Keep in mind not all deals last</strong> (in fact, most don’t). So if you see something that’s hot, I’d strongly suggest buy now (and return later if need be).</p>\n<p>With that, onto the deals! And thanks for supporting the site via the links below.

Almost all of the below are US.</p>\n<h3><span>Watches &amp; Wearables:</span></h3>\n<p>This covers anything you can wear that’s watch-like or activity band-like, including sensors.  Generally speaking, you’ll mostly find deals here that are on things I’ve written about in the past.  So you won’t find a deal on some random non-sports tech watch here, or on socks. Unless the socks have some crazy sensor or something in them.</p>\n<p>There are no deals currently.</p>\n<h3><span>Cycling Gear &amp; Trainers:</span></h3>\n<p>Got a bike? Then this section is for you.  Everything from bike computers to bike lights to trainers, it’s all here.  I won’t generally be adding things like brake cables or bike seats here, but if I find a good deal on a cassette to stack on that new direct drive trainer you just bought, I’ll probably list it here.</p>\n<p>There are no deals currently.</p>\n<p>And then here’s a separate bucket for trainers and indoor bikes:</p>\n<p>There are no deals currently.</p>\n<h3><span>Action Cameras &amp; Drones:</span></h3>\n<p>Wanna record it?  No better way than an action camera.  Anything that’s action camera-related or drone-related, you’ll find here.  That’s especially true of action camera mounts, which are often found for great deals around the holidays.  Same goes with drones and drone accessories.  Usually a great time to pick up an extra battery or extra props.</p>\n<p>There are no deals currently.</p>\n<h3><span>Other Sports &amp; Fitness:</span></h3>\n<p>Anything else that’s sports and fitness related that I think is interesting will be here.  It may not be super techy – but it’s stuff that most readers will be using in pursuit of their running/cycling/swimming/hiking/whatever.</p>\n<p>There are no deals currently.</p>\n<h3><span>DCR Random Gadget List:</span></h3>\n<p>This is basically the mostly totally unrelated gadgets and things I think are cool deals that I’ve likely bought one or five of (you can never have too many, right)?  Some of it’s probably photography stuff.  Some of it’s random stuff like chargers and battery packs that I use daily, fun camera gear I use to make videos like sliders and turntables, and well…just random things you’ll find around the DCR Cave.  It’s all random…but it’s all awesome randomness!</p>\n<p>There are no deals currently.</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for reading, and for supporting the site via the links above.</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"6a5d92303b9ea1512b9acbb06df6b90f3e42f0642b0ee28c473f31bb8269b370","category":"Cycling"}
