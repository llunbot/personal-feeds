Case in point: Korean engineers have built soft robots capable of rapid and powerful joint movements by employing the same mechanism that gives the mantis shrimp such a powerful punch, according to a <a href=\"http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.ado7696\">new paper</a> published in the journal Science Robotics.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/when-the-medium-matters-the-mighty-mantis-shrimp-pulls-its-punch-in-air/\">we've reported</a> previously, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp\">mantis shrimp</a> come in many different varieties; there are some 450 known species. But they can generally be grouped into two types: those that stab their prey with spear-like appendages (\"spearers\") and those that smash their prey (\"smashers\") with large, rounded, and hammer-like claws (\"raptorial appendages\"). Those strikes are so fast (as much as 23 meters per second, or 51 mph) and powerful, they often produce cavitation bubbles in the water, creating a shock wave that can serve as a follow-up strike, stunning and sometimes killing the prey. Sometimes a strike can even produce <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoluminescence\">sonoluminescence</a>, whereby the cavitation bubbles produce a brief flash of light as they collapse.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(18)30134-2\">a 2018 study</a>, the secret to that powerful punch seems to arise not from bulky muscles but from the spring-loaded anatomical structure of the shrimp's arms, akin to a bow and arrow or a mousetrap. The shrimp's muscles pull on a saddle-shaped structure in the arm, causing it to bend and store potential energy, which is released with the swinging of the club-like claw. It's essentially a latch-like mechanism (technically, Latch-mediated spring actuation, or LaMSA), with small structures in the muscle tendons called sclerites serving as the latch.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/this-mantis-shrimp-inspired-robotic-arm-can-crack-an-egg/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/this-mantis-shrimp-inspired-robotic-arm-can-crack-an-egg/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9c579fb49e25be3089664ec1d565506df7ad1968782ce29fb0af9470ecf2e799","category":"Tech"}
