This upgrade comes around one year after the previous iMac with the M3 chip was released.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iMac-M4-Apple.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nAs expected, the M4 chip in the iMac is available with up to a 10-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU. Apple says the iMac with the M4 chip is up to 1.7x faster for daily productivity tasks, and up to 2.1x faster for demanding workflows like photo editing and gaming, compared to the iMac with the M1 chip. In the iPad Pro, the M4 chip is up to 25% faster than the M3 chip, and this year-over-year improvement should be similar for the iMac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll variants of the M4 chip have a faster 16-core Neural Engine that boosts the performance of Apple Intelligence, but keep in mind that Apple Intelligence is also available on previous-generation iMac models with the M1 and M3 chips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iMac comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM, compared to 8GB for the previous base model, which likely confirms a rumor that 16GB of RAM will be the new minimum for many or all new Macs going forward. The computer can be configured with up to 32GB of RAM, and it continues to be available with up to 2TB of SSD storage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has upgraded the iMac with a 12-megapixel front camera with Center Stage support that keeps you centered in the frame. There is also a Desk View feature that shows your face and an overhead view of your desk at the same time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the iMac has not received any major design changes, Apple has introduced new color options for the all-in-one desktop computer, including \"fresh shades\" of green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, and blue, alongside the classic silver. In addition, the iMac can now be configured with a nano-texture display, which has a special coating that better scatters light to further minimize glare on the screen. Apple had previously offered the 2020 model of the Intel-based 27-inch iMac with a nano-texture display option, but this is the first time it has been offered for an Apple silicon version of the computer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four rear USB-C ports on higher-end iMac configurations with the 10-core M4 chip now support Thunderbolt 4, compared to two Thunderbolt 3 ports and two USB-C ports on the previous model. The base model iMac with the 8-core M4 chip has two Thunderbolt 4 ports.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nAlongside the new iMac, Apple announced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-usb-c-magic-accessories/\">updated versions of the Magic Mouse, Magic Keyboard, and Magic Trackpad</a>. The accessories are now equipped with USB-C charging ports, whereas the previous models used Lightning. Apple includes the Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard in the box with the iMac, and the Magic Trackpad is an optional upgrade.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new iMac is available to pre-order starting today, and it will be available beginning Friday, November 8. In the U.S. pricing starts at $1,299.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/\">Apple Announces iMac With M4 Chip, Upgraded Camera, Nano-Texture Display Option, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-nano-texture-display-option-and-more.2441129/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d91b383206d21015c4bf2c1a97f74a0b2fd094dda1a617fb1c3b0affeadbc106","category":"Apple"}
