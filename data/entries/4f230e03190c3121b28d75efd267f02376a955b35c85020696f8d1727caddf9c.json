The surprise performer this quarter was the iPad, which recorded its strongest non-holiday quarter since 2020 with more than $7 billion in sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other standout was Apple’s Services division, which continues to grow every quarter. Services posted $24.2 billion in revenue, up slightly over last quarter and more than 10 percent over last year. Mac sales also grew slightly over the same quarter in 2023, topping $7 billion in sales. Elsewhere, the iPhone was essentially flat, tallying $39.3 billion in sales versus $39.7 billion last year. And Wearables, Home, and Accessories, which includes Vision Pro and the Apple Watch, was also down slightly, from $8.3 billion to $8.1 billion. Here’s how the quarter broke down:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone: $39.3B (down 1 percent)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad: $8.1B (Up 24 percent)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac: $7B (Up 2 percent)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wearables: $8.1B (Down 2 percent)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Services: $24.2B (Up 14 percent)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>During the quarter, Apple released a new iPad Pro and iPad Air and dropped the price of the 10th-gen model. The new models clearly had an impact on sales, with all regions posting growth except China, which declined about 7 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will hold a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/\">conference call</a> at 5 p.m. ET to discuss the results of the quarter. We will update this article with any interesting and relevant information. </p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4f230e03190c3121b28d75efd267f02376a955b35c85020696f8d1727caddf9c","category":"Apple"}
