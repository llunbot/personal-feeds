From home working to social distancing, we've sacrificed much of the freedom and activity of our usual daily lives, and most people can’t wait to get back to normal. But a time of reflection has also given us pause for thought on how to build a greener world as we emerge back into it.</span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>A recent University of Oxford and Imperial College London study found that those who swap their commute from driving to active transport (eg, cycling, walking or running) just one day a week could reduce their carbon footprint by about 0.5 tonnes over a year. But for many, the length of the commute can mean walking and running simply aren't practical, and even cycling on a regular bike can be ambitious if the route is long, hilly or it's a particularly windy day.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>This is where an electric bike can be a real game changer, giving you that extra support and a break when you run out of steam. The e-bike industry is doing wonders towards making cycling more accessible. Whether you have a condition which makes cycling for a sustained period of time a challenge, or your legs simply don't feel as fresh as they used to, electric assistance can really help counteract limitations you might feel riding a regular bike. </span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><span><span>With a folding electric bike, you can also cycle part of the way to work and then neatly tuck your bike into a car boot or fold it up for the train.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span>An e-bike can also help everyone make use of the other benefits to be had from cycling to work. It can work out much cheaper than taking the train or driving, and with cycle highways and dedicated cycle routes, you can cut out some of the frustration of waiting around in traffic to get around a city. Plus, you’ll be getting in your exercise for the day on the way.</span></p>\n<p><span><br />\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/btwin_tilt_500_02.jpg?itok=nG-wp9H8\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p></p></span></p>\n<p><span>Beyond the commute, electric bikes can really open up new opportunities. Everyone is keen to get back out exploring and enjoying an active lifestyle after being cooped up off and on for over a year. </span></p>\n<p><span>With an e-bike, you can go further afield than you'd usually be able to manage – that steep incline halfway through the route is no longer an issue, and a ride that might have taken all day can be finished early enough to leave time for a trip to the pub. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you enjoy a cycling weekend away but don't want to be tackling intense rides every day, then you can pick and choose when you want to put in the work and when you want to take it easy with </span>the electric assistance option.</p>\n<p><span><span>Combining the convenience of a folding bike with the range-expanding ability of an electric bike, the B'Twin Tilt 500 is the ideal companion for those wanting to incorporate cycling into their daily routine as a main means of transport, as well as to those wanting to push their usual limits with longer, trickier rides. </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>You can go from riding to folding and storing the bike in seconds, making it handy for hopping on and off busy trains on your commute or on your journey to explore the country at your leisure.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>The B'Twin Tilt 500 has an aluminium frame with a 24V built-in battery with a range of 35km, which can be charged directly through the frame, or can be removed to recharge separately. There are six speeds to choose from, and the 7.8Ah electric assistance is controlled by pedalling sensors, which can detect how much support you need. </span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>The bike also features ergonomic grips and an ergonomic saddle which can be height-adjusted. B'Twin is so confident in the quality of its product, it offers a lifetime warranty on your bike's stem, handlebar and frame (excluding the hinge).</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span><br />\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/btwin_tilt_500_03.jpg?itok=0SXyP4Km\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p></p></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span>B'Twin is Decathlon's in-house cycling brand.
