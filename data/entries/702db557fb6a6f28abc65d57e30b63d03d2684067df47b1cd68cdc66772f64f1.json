The world outside Google's walled garden has no rules at all and offers a countless number of questionable apps available for sideloading. To help combat the surge of sideloaded malware, Google Play can now <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2023/10/enhanced-google-play-protect-real-time.html\">pop up a malware scanner</a> at install time if it decides the app you're trying to sideload is interesting.</p>\n<p>Google Play's malware system, called \"Google Play Protect,\" has always been able to check sideloaded apps for malware, but it used faster techniques like a definition file, and this happened quietly in the background. This new technique will delay your app installation with a full-screen \"scanning\" interface while Google runs a deep scan of the app code. Google's blog post says this is \"real-time scanning at the code-level to combat novel malicious apps\" and that Google Play Protect can \"recommend a real-time app scan when installing apps that have never been scanned before to help detect emerging threats.\"</p>\n<p>The scan will involve sending bits and pieces of the app to Google for analysis.
