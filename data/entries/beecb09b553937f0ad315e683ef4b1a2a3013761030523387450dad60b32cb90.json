{"title":"★ European Data Protection Board Goes There, Rules Against Meta’s ‘Pay or OK’ Model","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2024/04/edpb_meta_pay_or_ok","date":1713407724000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@eric_seufert/post/C53UyPNr9lm\">Eric Seufert, on Threads</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The EDPB — the EU’s legislature of privacy authorities — adopted \na draft opinion today determining that large online platforms \ncan’t offer a “pay or okay” model as a strict binary and must also \noffer a third, free choice that doesn’t utilize personalized \nadvertising. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Given which way the wind’s been blowing in the EU, this is unsurprising, but make no mistake, this is a radical stance. <a href=\"https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-04/edpb_opinion_202408_consentorpay_en.pdf\">From the EDPB’s draft ruling (PDF)</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The offering of (only) a paid alternative to the service which \nincludes processing for behavioural advertising purposes should \nnot be the default way forward for controllers. When developing \nthe alternative to the version of the service with behavioural \nadvertising, large online platforms should consider providing data \nsubjects with an ‘equivalent alternative’ that does not entail the \npayment of a fee. If controllers choose to charge a fee for access \nto the ‘equivalent alternative’, controllers should consider also \noffering a further alternative, free of charge, without \nbehavioural advertising, e.g. with a form of advertising involving \nthe processing of less (or no) personal data. This is a \nparticularly important factor in the assessment of certain \ncriteria for valid consent under the GDPR. In most cases, whether \na further alternative without behavioural advertising is offered \nby the controller, free of charge, will have a substantial impact \non the assessment of the validity of consent, in particular with \nregard to the detriment aspect. </p>\n\n<p>With respect to the requirements of the GDPR for valid consent, \nfirst of all, consent needs to be ‘freely given’. In order to \navoid detriment that would exclude freely given consent, any fee \nimposed cannot be such as to effectively inhibit data subjects \nfrom making a free choice. Furthermore, detriment may arise where \nnon-consenting data subjects do not pay a fee and thus face \nexclusion from the service, especially in cases where the service \nhas a prominent role, or is decisive for participation in social \nlife or access to professional networks, even more so in the \npresence of lock-in or network effects. As a result, detriment is \nlikely to occur when large online platforms use a ‘consent or pay’ \nmodel to obtain consent for the processing. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@eric_seufert/post/C54cNcWxJYI\">Seufert again</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In its opinion on Meta’s use of the Pay or Okay model, the EDPB \neffectively says that any sufficiently valuable product must offer \na free version that doesn’t monetize via behavioral ads. That the \nquality of being indispensable means consumers must have \nunfettered access to it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What makes this all the more outrageous is that many major publishers in the EU use this exact same “pay or OK” model to achieve GDPR compliance — and none offer a free alternative with non-targeted ads. Don’t hold your breath waiting for <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/international/\">Der Spiegel</a> to offer free access without ads. Christ, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/04/der-spiegel-pay-or-ok.jpeg\">they don’t even let you look at their homepage</a> without paying or consenting to targeted ads. And Spotify quite literally <a href=\"https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/audience-targeting/\">brags about its ad targeting</a>. But Spotify is an EU company, so of course it wasn’t designated as a “gatekeeper” by the protection racketeers running the European Commission.</p>\n\n<p>They’re not saying “pay or OK” is illegal. They’re saying it’s illegal only if you’re a big company from outside the EU with a very popular platform.</p>\n\n<p>Meta’s only options for compliance with this ruling, as I see it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Offer a new free tier with contextual, rather than targeted, ads. To achieve an ARPU equivalent to Meta’s paid and free-with-targeted-ads tiers, this new offering would likely have to inundate users with a veritable avalanche of annoying ads. This, I would wager, would be deemed “malicious compliance” and thus also illegal.</p></li>\n<li><p>Offer a new free tier with contextual, rather than targeted, ads — but only show roughly the same frequency of ads as their lucrative free-with-targeted-ads tier. This is what the EDPB (and EC) are demanding, and seemingly think they can force Meta to do. Meta would almost certainly see ARPU plummet for all users who opt into this tier. Who knows if the revenue would even be sufficient to break even per such user?</p></li>\n<li><p>Invent some novel way to generate as much revenue per non-targeted ad as targeted ones. This is the “nerd harder” fantasy solution, a la demanding that secure end-to-end encryption provide back doors available only to “the good guys”.</p></li>\n<li><p>Cease offering Facebook and Instagram in the EU. (WhatsApp doesn’t monetize through targeted ads, so isn’t germane to this ruling.) This is the option <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/more_on_the_eus_market_might\">the EDPB and EC believe “unthinkable”</a> for Meta to take, because the EU is, in their minds, an indispensable market.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I don’t see how Meta can risk the second choice. Meta could afford to see ARPU plummet solely within the EU, and at first thought, you might think <em>some</em> revenue per EU user is surely better than <em>no</em> revenue at all from the EU. But if Meta caves and complies with this ruling by offering a free tier with significantly lower ARPU, that opens the door for regulators and legislative bodies around the globe to demand the same. Then, <em>poof</em> goes Meta as an industry colossus.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect the EU regulatory bodies have some surprises coming regarding how this is going to play out.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"beecb09b553937f0ad315e683ef4b1a2a3013761030523387450dad60b32cb90","category":"Tech"}
