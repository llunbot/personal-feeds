The low setting sufficed for my night time trail riding while climbing. The high was like riding into a light tunnel while descending. 4800 lumens is a lot of juice. But the MaXx-D has a few clever tricks up its sleeve. Reflex is some clever tech that Exposure developed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>I feel like my bike looks like an Aussie 4×4 with this massive spotty on it!</em></p>\n<p>Reflex is genius. It automatically adjusts the output of the light to increase the brightness when bookin’ it down a trail and then intuitively dims for slower riding. This was immediately noticeable on a ripping descent here that ends in an abrupt wall at the bottom. At first, I thought the light was losing battery life.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-11.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This does a few things. First, it optimizes battery efficiency. The computer within the MaXx-D light takes data from gyroscopes and thermistors in a constant real-time process to make these adjustments. It takes approximately 20 minutes of riding to calibrate Reflex to your riding style and terrain. Once calibrated, the readings will remain in the light’s built-in programmable memory unless the riding conditions or style change.</p>\n<p>Second, the displayed run time will be achieved by averaging the output over the period. So, if you’re descending for 12 hours, your battery life output will vary compared to if you were climbing for 12 hours.</p>\n<p>You can toggle Reflex by toggling through the Optimized Mode Selector…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Optimized_Mode_Selector.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Optimized_Mode_Selector.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Optimized_Mode_Selector.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Optimized_Mode_Selector.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Optimized Mode Selector – OMS</h3>\n<p>Reflex is available in the first three Program Modes and only in High mode.</p>\n<p>To enter these various OMS settings, start with the power off, then hold the stainless-steel Function button down. The light will emit a set of flashes. Keep the stainless-steel Function button held down, and the OLED screen on the back of the light will say ‘PGM 1’.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-22.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-22.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-22.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Look at the chart (this is also laser etched on the light’s casing) and cycle through the different programs, click the stainless-steel Function button until you reach your desired program and then release, the OLED screen on the back of the light will then display ‘SET’.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-26.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-26.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>For example, if you want to put your light in Program 4, then you release the stainless-steel Function Button after the OLED displays ‘PGM 4’. The light will then remain in Program 4, regardless of if it is turned on or off, until it is reprogrammed. The first three modes use Reflex; the others do not.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-10.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-10.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-9.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-9.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Testing, Testing</h3>\n<p><em>36 hours?!</em> Immediately, I charged the light completely and then ran it until it died on each of the modes. To my surprise, I found the estimated battery life to be very accurate. What is hard to test, however, is what the Reflex output is. But since it’s an average between fast and slow riding, you can rely on the stated output, give or take a few hours.</p>\n<p>In my riding experience, where my climbs are between one and five hours and the descent time is usually 25%, the stated output still remained accurate.</p>\n<p>Once the battery was drained, I timed full recharge at 6 hours and 15 minutes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-14.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-14.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-15.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-15.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>To help display the power level of the light, the LEDs on the back will glow colors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Green – High – 100 – 50%</li>\n<li>Amber – Medium – 50 – 25%</li>\n<li>Red – Low – 25 – 0%</li>\n<li>Red Flashing – 5 – 0%</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-25.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Hardware</h3>\n<p>Coming from a series of more affordable lights over the years, I’m used to silicone straps and plastic clamps, so I was stoked to see a burly metal handlebar clamp for the MaXx-D. The clamp is robust and results in zero movement, no matter how much you jump around and regardless of terrain.</p>\n<p>However, these metal parts are easily lost since they’re all individual pieces. So I suggest keeping the light in some sort of bag. To remedy this, I’d rather have a hinge clamp like you’d find on a dropper remote than a slide-in clamp. Then, if you have 22.2⌀ clamp bars, it gets finicky installing…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-27.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-27.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>22.2⌀ Handlebar Weirdo Woes</h3>\n<p>If you have a 22.2⌀ handlebar, you’ll have to run a shim to get the 31.8 clamp diameter to fit. Similarly, with 25.4⌀ or 26⌀ mm clamp bars. To further complicate matters, these BTCHN Bullmoose bars have a bend that doesn’t offer a flat spot to clamp the light in the center. In order to get this clamp to fit, the shim had to be cut down to 1/4″ wide. This isn’t a dealbreaker by any means, but is worth noting.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-4a.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-4a.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-4a.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-4a.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-23.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-23.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Charger</h3>\n<p>My biggest qualm with the MaXx-D is its charger. In an era of proprietary chargers galore, I wish brands could rally behind simple, prolific hardware. A USB 2.0 cord would be awesome. Hell, even just a USB-to-USB cord would be great. I’d love to be able to charge this light while on a multi-day bike tour or with a battery pack and not have to lug this beast around.</p>\n<p><em>Other smaller, lower output Exposure lights, such as the <a href=\"https://www.exposurelights.com/collections/mtb\" target=\"_blank\">Diablo and Zenith series</a>, use a USB to 12v wall outlet plug. </em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-Cover.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-Cover.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-Cover.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-Cover.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<p>If you ride a lot at night, you can get a dynamo setup for your bike, or you can just get a bomber light like this one and simplify things. The MaXx-D has some clever technology, plenty of output, a robust metal construction, and is assembled in the UK. Its price will pinch, but fear not – if you break it, they’ll repair it for you. Exposure has great customer service, and as a family-owned and operated brand, it feels good to support them.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-19.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Exposure-Lights-MaXx-D-Mk16-Review-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The brand sent me this MaXx-D to review, but I’ll be buying it from them. There are countless dealers in the USA you can buy from and they’ll handle any warranty or repair issues for you, too. All the more reason to buy from your local bike shop. Exposure offers a 2-year warranty on its lights, so there’s added reassurance there, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>2-year warranty</li>\n<li>The stated runtimes are very accurate (as far as I could test)</li>\n<li>Plenty of light (deer stop dead in their tracks)</li>\n<li>Three modes</li>\n<li>Great optics; light is clear and sharp</li>\n<li>Reflex Technology is AWESOME (the coolest thing about this light!)</li>\n<li>No need for a helmet light (seriously)</li>\n<li>Wide beam</li>\n<li>Assembled in the UK</li>\n<li>Repairable (huge)</li>\n<li>Robust construction (I’ve dropped it a few times)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s BIG</li>\n<li>It’s HEAVY</li>\n<li>You’ve got to send it back for battery service; no right to repair</li>\n<li>Bracket hardware is finicky, especially if you have it shimmed to a 22.2⌀ clamp handlebar</li>\n<li>The proprietary charging port complicates taking the light on a bike tour</li>\n<li>Off-road/singletrack use only</li>\n<li>Expensive but is assembled in-house in the UK</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.exposurelights.com/products/maxx-d-mk16-gun-metal-black\" target=\"_blank\">Exposure</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/exposure-lights-maxx-d-mk16-review/\">Exposure Lights MaXx-D Mk16 Review: Leading the Charge</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"068870fd5280103e7a7892668872d6b70bd6c1ef94bcb0bb5eb213be584c68dd","category":"Cycling"}
