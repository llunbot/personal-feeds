Early leaks and rumors that suggested a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti or RTX 3070 level of performance for the top-end Arc card never panned out, and the best Arc cards can usually only compete with $300-and-under midrange GPUs from AMD and Nvidia.</p>\n<p>Today Intel is quietly releasing another GPU into that same midrange milieu, <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-arc-a580-graphics-available-worldwide.html#gs.67tjji\">the Arc A580</a>. Priced starting at $179, the card aims to compete with lower-end last-gen GPUs like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 or AMD Radeon RX 6600, cards currently available for around $200 that aim to provide a solid 1080p gaming experience (though sometimes with a setting or two turned down for newer and more demanding games).</p>\n\n<p>The A580 is based on the exact same Alchemist silicon as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/intel-a770-a750-review-strong-gpu-alternatives-that-we-very-nearly-recommend/\">the Arc A750 and A770</a>, but with just 24 of the Xe graphics cores enabled, instead of 28 for the A750 and 32 for the A770. That does mean it has the exact same 256-bit memory bus as those higher-end cards, attached to a serviceable-for-the-price 8GB pool of GDDR6 RAM. Reviews from <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-arc-a580-review-a-new-budget-contender/5\">outlets like Tom's Hardware</a> generally show the A580 beating the RTX 3050 and RX 6600 in most games, but falling a little short of the RTX 3060 and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-amds-269-rx-7600-is-a-good-1080p-card-but-the-rtx-4060-looms/\">RX 7600</a> (to say nothing of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/geforce-rtx-4060-review-not-thrilling-but-a-super-efficient-299-workhorse/\">RTX 4060</a>, which beats the Arc A750 and A770 in most games).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974720#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974720&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a6ae44ca7482cfd8de61f09c72d17b3d2b1c4bba2162be3fffb1a85a51566c5e","category":"Tech"}
