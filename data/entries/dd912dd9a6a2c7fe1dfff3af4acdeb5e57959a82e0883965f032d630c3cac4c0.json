However, a new report claims that the Apple Watch Series 10 coming this fall will be even bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing over at Medium, <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/2h24-%E6%96%B0%E6%AC%BEapple-watch%E9%97%9C%E6%B3%A8%E7%84%A6%E9%BB%9E-series-10-%E9%89%91%E5%8A%9B%E7%89%B9-3d%E5%88%97%E5%8D%B0-the-focus-of-the-2h24-new-apple-watch-series-10-and-98075c44ce92&amp;xcust=1-1-2370954-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Ming-Chi Kuo says</a> the upcoming Apple Watch “will feature form factor upgrades, including larger screen sizes,” bumping the size from 41mm and 45mm to 45mm and 49mm. That would represent the largest increase in screen size over a previous generation:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Watch Series 1: 38mm/42mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 4: 40mm/44mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 7: 41mm/45mm</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With the larger screen sizes has come an increase in overall size as well:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Watch Series 1 (38mm): 38.6 x 33.3 x 10.5mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 4 (40mm): 40 x 34mm x 10.7mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 7: (41mm): 41 x 35 x 10.7mm</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The 45mm Apple Watch is larger still, measuring 45 x 38 x 10.7mm. For those with smaller wrists, that’s probably too large. And even if the Apple Watch SE stays at 40/44mm, you’ll be able to get a smaller watch only by giving up a lot of features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, Kuo says the larger Apple Watch will jump to 49mm, the same size as the Apple Watch Ultra, which has a 49mm display and measures 49 x 44 x 14.4mm. That’s a very big watch and more of a niche size than any of the larger Apple Watches that came before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To compensate for the larger screen, Kuo says Apple will introduce “a thinner design” for the Series 10, which is in line with other rumors. Mark Gurman reported this week that Apple is looking to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369453/ipad-pro-thin-design-iphone-macbook-apple-watch.html\">slim down</a> its entire lineup following the launch of the M4 iPad Pro, with the MacBook Pro, iPhone, and Apple Watch all getting thinner cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to unveil the Apple Watch Series 10 in September alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16</a>.
