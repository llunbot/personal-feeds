However, real-world data speeds are far slower regardless, so this may be a non-issue. As previously rumored, Gurman said Apple's first 5G modem will not support the ultra-fast 5G standard known as mmWave.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has already been secretly testing the new modem on devices deployed to hundreds of employees around the world, according to the report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor now, the modem is not expected to be used in higher-end devices, such as the iPhone 17 Pro models next year. As explained by Gurman, Apple's switch away from Qualcomm modems will be a risky move, as it could affect the performance of phone calls and cellular data. By testing the modem with lower-end products, Apple can mitigate this risk.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the other hand, the report outlined some advantages of Apple's first modem compared to the Qualcomm chips, including lower power consumption, improved cellular network scanning, and satellite connectivity enhancements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile designed by Apple, the modem is said to be manufactured by iPhone chipmaker TSMC.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is rumored to have been working on its own 5G modem for iPhones since at least 2018, as part of a plan to reduce and eventually eliminate its dependance on Qualcomm. Earlier this year, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-extends-qualcomm-modem-licensing-deal/\">extended its 5G modem supply agreement</a> with Qualcomm for iPhone launches through 2026. In line with that timeframe, Gurman said that Apple hopes that its in-house modem will overtake Qualcomm's technology by 2027.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2017, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/20/apple-qualcomm-1-billion-lawsuit/\">Apple sued Qualcomm</a> over anticompetitive practices and $1 billion in unpaid royalty rebates. The two companies settled the lawsuit in 2019, and Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/\">acquired the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business</a> that same year. That purchase provided Apple with a portfolio of cellular-related patents to bolster its development.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/\">Apple 5G Modem</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-5g-modem-plans-report/\">Apple's 5G Modem Expected to Debut in iPhone SE 4, iPhone 17 Air, and Low-End iPads Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-5g-modem-expected-to-debut-in-iphone-se-4-iphone-17-air-and-low-end-ipads-next-year.2444780/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cd26bd7defeea8ed288b160166335903fc1e2aeab4e0f9883aff258841f79094","category":"Apple"}
