The Belgian won’t be in Kelso to defend his title. He is busy sweeping <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta stages over in Spain</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the reigning champion out of the frame, we will get a new winner in Felixstowe on Sunday 8th September. Let’s see who that could be…</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Favourites to win the 2024 Tour of Britain</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep)</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0509-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"remco evenepoel\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0509-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0509-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0509-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0509-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0509-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0509-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0509-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0509-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0509-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0509-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Cyclist/Patrik Lundin</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fresh from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Olympic</a> glory, Remco Evenepoel will make his comeback to racing at the Tour of Britain. This will be the Belgian rider’s debut Tour of Britain and will be the first race he’s competed in the UK since winning the time-trial World Championship in Stirling last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evenepoel has a strong hit rate at second-tier stage races during his career, winning five out of the seven he has started since his big crash at Il Lombardia in 2020. With a lack of WorldTour opponents, he will start as the overwhelming favourite, especially with no <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pogacar-vingegaard-rivalry\" target=\"_blank\">Pogačar and Vingegaard</a> to chase him down. The Tour white jersey winner will also use this race as a tune-up before the upcoming UCI Road World Championships in Switzerland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The profile doesn’t necessarily suit Remco, but when has that stopped him before?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tom Pidcock (Ineos Grenadiers)</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-14-min-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"tom pidcock ineos grenadiers tour de france 2024 transfer to red bull\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-14-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-14-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-14-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-14-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-14-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-14-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-14-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-14-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-14-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-14-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin/Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also making his post-Olympic return, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tom-pidcock\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Pidcock</a> will take on the British roads this September. The two-time mountain bike Olympic champion is still to win a senior stage race – or indeed a senior road race in the UK – but he will be hungry to continue his victorious year at the Tour of Britain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pidcock has competed at the previous two editions of the race, but is still to win a stage. The finale to Barnsley on Stage 3 could be his strongest chance of adding a home race victory to his <em>palmarès</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pidcock leads an <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a> team that will hope to win their home race for the first time since 2013.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n

The star of the youngster show, however, is Frenchman Paul Magnier. The 20-year-old is a strong sprinter able to hang on in the hills. Some have touted him as the ‘next Julian Alaphilippe’ in fact. He is fresh from a podium finish at the Bretagne Classic last week and two stage wins at the Giro Next Gen back in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magnier was also born in Texas, where he spent the first three years of his life. Americans, feel free to claim him.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Phil Bauhaus (Bahrain Victorious)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T143948.509-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T143948.509-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T143948.509-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T143948.509-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T143948.509-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T143948.509-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T143948.509-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T143948.509-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T143948.509-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T143948.509-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/file-2024-08-28T143948.509.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Phil Bauhaus is a consistent sprinter. He is a solid fixture inside the top ten on Grand Tours and a victor on the WorldTour level at races such as Tirreno-Adriatico, Critérium du Dauphiné and the Tour de Pologne. He relishes a chaotic sprint, and there are sure to be plenty of those at the Tour of Britain this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The German hasn’t competed in the Tour of Britain since 2018 when he was riding for Team Sunweb. His current team <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/bahrain-victorious\" target=\"_blank\">Bahrain Victorious</a> hasn’t raced the Tour of Britain in the team’s almost decade-long history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, keep an eye on Bauhaus’ teammate Matevž Govekar.

That said, the stage to Redcar should suit his <em>puncheur </em>qualities. He has also shown signs of being courageous and unafraid to roll the dice.

In fact, he has won a stage at every Tour of Britain he has started. However, since 2018, he has not returned to the race. It’s about time he came back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dutchman doesn’t have a stage that suits him down to a tee like the other four stages he’s claimed. Maybe Stages 2 and 3 could play into his hands, but he should be a rider to watch based on his record and prestige. He is also set to move across to Astana next year, so he would surely like to finish his tenure with Bahrain on a high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">full Tour of Britain preview</a> including the start list, TV timings and stage profiles.</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/joe-blackmore-tour-de-lavenir\">Pro Log: First ever British Tour de l’Avenir win, No GB at European Champs, Ben O’Connor leads Vuelta a España</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/saint-piran\">State of the nation: Inside the UK domestic racing scene</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a España 2024: Route, start list, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2024: Route, start list, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-favourites\">Tour of Britain 2024 favourites and riders to watch</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"51a19f9b9bb66b341aff23e37804d1f1974eca038d869f3fb48859329794a016","category":"Cycling"}
