All existing iPhone camera lenses have fixed apertures, but some Android smartphones have offered variable aperture over the years, such as Samsung's Galaxy S9 series.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith a mechanical system, users could manually set a smaller aperture. This would allow photos to be shot with a shallow depth-of-field effect, where the subject stays in focus while the background is blurred. Apple already offers this effect on iPhones with Portrait Mode, but it is artificially generated, whereas this change would make it natural.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPortrait Mode can occasionally have difficulties separating subjects in the foreground from the background, a problem that a mechanical aperture would solve.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to release the iPhone 17 series in September 2025, and it is possible that mechanical aperture will be limited to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-17-5-major-features/\">rumored high-end \"iPhone 17 Ultra\" model</a> (dubbed \"iPhone 17 Slim\" for now). With the devices still being over a year away, however, some of Apple's alleged camera-related plans could change.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/\">The Information</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/iphone-17-mechanical-aperture-rumor/\">iPhone 17 Rumored to Feature Mechanical Aperture for Portrait Mode</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-rumored-to-feature-mechanical-aperture-for-portrait-mode.2432041/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"52ca944e0b2f2416a080e5322e23a7653b4601a8808ec811a43d397b8e0df486","category":"Apple"}
