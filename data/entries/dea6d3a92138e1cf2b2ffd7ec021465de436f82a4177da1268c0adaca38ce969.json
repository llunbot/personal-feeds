Owners of these older models will of course continue to be able to access Netflix through a browser.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn summary, the ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ models set to lose support for the Netflix app are as follows:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n  <li>‌iPhone‌ 8</li>\r<br />\n  <li>‌iPhone‌ 8 Plus</li>\r<br />\n  <li>‌iPhone‌ X</li>\r<br />\n  <li>‌iPad Pro‌ (1st generation)</li>\r<br />\n  <li>‌iPad‌ (5th generation)</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nThe code strings referring to the impending change were found in the Netflix app by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris. It is not known which update will end support for the above Apple devices, but given that the code strings are present in the latest version, the update is likely to be released fairly soon. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/\">Netflix</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/12/netflix-app-to-end-support-for-ios-16/\">Netflix App to End Support for iOS 16, Require iPhone XS or Later to Work</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-app-to-end-support-for-ios-16-require-iphone-xs-or-later-to-work.2435986/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dea6d3a92138e1cf2b2ffd7ec021465de436f82a4177da1268c0adaca38ce969","category":"Apple"}
