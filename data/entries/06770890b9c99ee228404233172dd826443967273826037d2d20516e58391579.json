After years of growth, most recently fueled in no small part by the COVID-19 pandemic that also has decimated physical retailers across the country, the company is reportedly planning to open its own department stores.</p>\n<p>The move would represent a subtle shift in strategy for the e-commerce giant. Though it has experimented with its own brick-and-mortar locations, Amazon's few-dozen currently branded stores tend to be small affairs that offer a selection of goods. Its largest customer-facing real estate, Whole Foods, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/amazon-goes-big-into-brick-and-mortar-with-13-7-whole-foods-purchase/\">came through an acquisition</a>. If Amazon follows through on its department store plans, as reported by <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-retail-department-stores-11629330842?mod=hp_lead_pos1\">The Wall Street Journal</a>, it would represent the company's biggest ground-up push into physical retail, a flagging but still <a href=\"https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/e-commerce-sales-retail-sales-ten-year-review/\">massive</a> sector of the economy.</p>\n<p>Don’t expect Amazon to follow in the footsteps of JC Penney or Macy’s, however. Rather, Amazon appears to be following a playbook similar to the one embraced by grocers Aldi and Trader Joe’s. Where most existing department stores are on the order of 100,000 square feet, Amazon’s stores will be about a third the size, with the first set to appear in California and Ohio. And like Aldi and Trader Joe’s, expect Amazon’s department stores to heavily feature Amazon’s private-label goods.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788505#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788505&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"06770890b9c99ee228404233172dd826443967273826037d2d20516e58391579","category":"Tech"}
