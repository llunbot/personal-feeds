Bianchi’s engineers used topological optimization to cut weight and fine-tune stiffness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, what is topological optimization?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-shock-close-up--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-shock-close-up--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bianchi e-Vertic FX Trail E-Bike shock close up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-shock-close-up--jpg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-shock-close-up--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-shock-close-up--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-shock-close-up--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-shock-close-up--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s finding the optimal material layout, minimizing material usage, and maximizing structural performance (like stiffness or strength) under specific loads and constraints. It’s basically using FEM simulation to let the forces exerted on a bike frame more freely determine where more or less material is needed. Bianchi’s result is a lighter, snappier chassis with a better overall response when things get rowdy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, they created a mix of blended hydroformed shapes and a few smooth welds for a light but strong aesthetic, as sleek as many carbon ebikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Slacker Geometry &amp; More Fork Travel, too</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-frame--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-frame--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bianchi e-Vertic FX Trail E-Bike frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-frame--jpg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-frame--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-frame--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-frame--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-frame--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Geometry-wise, the e-Vertic FX head angle slackens to 64.5<strong>°</strong>, planting the front end for more confident descending and paving the way for an updated suspension. Speaking of suspension, the e-Vertic FX features 140mm of 4-bar rear wheel travel now matched to 150mm of fork travel making it better suited for fast, technical singletrack.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Big Bosch CX Power, Big Range</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-motor--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-motor--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bianchi e-Vertic FX Trail E-Bike motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-motor--jpg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-motor--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-motor--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-motor--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-motor--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the hood, it’s all business. The e-Vertic FX runs the Bosch Performance Line CX motor, delivering 85Nm of torque (…over-the-air upgradable this summer via Bosch App to 100Nm!) Paired with a bigger 800Wh Powertube battery inside the downtube, it’s built for long, high-output rides—up to 100 km or around 7 hours in mixed mountain terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-rider-view--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-rider-view--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bianchi e-Vertic FX Trail E-Bike rider view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-rider-view--jpg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-rider-view--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-rider-view--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-rider-view--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-rider-view--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Want even more range? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can tack on a 250Wh range extender external battery, giving you a 30% boost in capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>​Bianchi e-Vertic FX Trail eMTB – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-side--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"7956\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-side--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bianchi e-Vertic FX Trail E-Bike side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-side--jpg.webp 7956w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-side--297x204.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-side--1536x1055.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-side--120x82.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-side--768x527.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll have two versions to choose from:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>e-Vertic FX 9.1<br /></strong>This top-end 5850€ version arrives with mechanical SRAM SX Eagle 12-speed and a RockShox Lyrik 29er fork. But it is also UDH ready. Screen-wise, the 9.1 rocks a full color Bosch Kiox 300 display for easy visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>e-Vertic FX 9.2</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly identical in build spec, the $6185 / 5450€ 9.2 arrives with SRAM SX Eagle 12 group. The Bianchi e-Vertic FX Trail 9.2 swaps forks for the RockShox Psylo Silver RC 29 to save a few bucks. And the display moves from the Kiox 300 to the basic single color LCD Bosch Intuvia 100.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-power--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-power--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bianchi e-Vertic FX Trail E-Bike power\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-power--jpg.webp 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-power--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-power--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-power--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bianchi-e-Vertic-FX-Trail-E-Bike-power--768x512.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both models are available in Aqua Green/Metallic Celeste or more subdued Graphite/Silver Gray.
