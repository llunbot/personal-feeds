The pads are connected with a silicone strap, within which are unseen wires taking power from the USB-C port that is situated in the middle pad’s body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the other end to the Watch charger is the Qi2 charging pad on which you magnetically clamp your iPhone for fast 15W wireless charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the middle there’s 5W charger for the AirPods case. You can also use this Qi pad to charge another iPhone (from iPhone 8) although non-magnetically and much slower—but it’s fine if you have time on your side.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_folded.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Anker Ultra Compact 3 in 1 Qi2 Charger folded\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_folded.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_folded.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_folded.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_folded.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_folded.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_folded.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_folded.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In some ways, and I mean this as no insult, the Anker 3-in-1 resembles a snail when folded up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounds worse when you consider that its closest rival is called the ButterFly. That cuter-named fold-up charger from Twelve South is more glamorous but can charge only two devices at one time, unlike the Anker that can charge three simultaneously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MagSafe ButterFly and its cheaper Qi2 cousin the ButterFly SE measure 2.4 x 2.4 x 0.9 inches (6.1 x 6.1 x 2.3cm) so are about the same size except not as high because there’s no Watch charger on top. The SE is also a third lighter than the Anker MagGo (105g vs Anker’s 150g). Read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2190224/twelve-south-butterfly-2-in-1-magsafe-charger-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Twelve South ButterFly review</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2444819/twelve-south-butterfly-se-2-in-1-qi2-charger-review-minimalist-beauty.html\" target=\"_blank\">ButterFly SE review</a> for more information on those products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being a little deeper, like the ButterFly the Anker MagGo will easily slip into a pocket but remember that it does require a cable (included) to connect to a separate USB-C wall charger (also included).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone mostly lays flat, but it can be placed into a more useful StandBy mode with some folding magic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Watch, however, always charges flat so no Nightstand mode is possible. The Twelve South ButterFly does win here as it can be folded 180 degrees to place the Watch in Nightstand mode.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-3-in-1-MagGo-Charger-Foldable.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Folding Wireless Charging Station\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-3-in-1-MagGo-Charger-Foldable.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-3-in-1-MagGo-Charger-Foldable.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-3-in-1-MagGo-Charger-Foldable.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-3-in-1-MagGo-Charger-Foldable.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-3-in-1-MagGo-Charger-Foldable.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-3-in-1-MagGo-Charger-Foldable.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-3-in-1-MagGo-Charger-Foldable.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Anker</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Folding Wireless Charging Station comes in four colors: black and white, of course, and also light pastel sort-of-green and pink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes with a 5ft (1.5m) USB-C charging cable and a 40W wall charger. The cable and wall charger for the green and pink versions is white rather than being color-coordinated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The inclusion of the charger with the $89 Anker MagGo matches what you get with the original $129 ButterFly (although it’s 40W compared to the ButterFly’s 30W charger). The ButterFly SE ships with no wall charger, so you’ll need to supply your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great benefit for travellers is the inclusion of international plug adapters to slip on to the wall charger’s foldable U.S. plug prongs.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_unfolded.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Anker Ultra Compact 3 in 1 Qi2 Charger unfolded\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_unfolded.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_unfolded.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_unfolded.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_unfolded.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_unfolded.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_unfolded.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_unfolded.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The snail comparison is unfair given the fast speeds at which the MagGo can wirelessly output its power. Like the ButterFly SE, the Anker MagGo uses Qi2 (pronounced “chee too”) tech that matches Apple’s MagSafe at 15W. It’s based on MagSafe so there’s no real difference except for price.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>(For more on this, see our explanation <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2128673/what-is-qi2-is-qi2-iphone-wireless-charging-better-than-magsafe.html\" target=\"_blank\">Is Qi2 is as good as MagSafe?</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Again like the ButterFly models, the MagGo is certified by Apple for Watch fast charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more options check out our reviews of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html\" target=\"_blank\">best MagSafe Chargers for iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668468/best-apple-watch-chargers-stands-docks.html\" target=\"_blank\">best Apple Watch chargers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Qi2 ButterFly SE costs <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Compatible-Wireless-Certified-Foldable/dp/B0D8PYWHZR\" target=\"_blank\">$89.99</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-Compatible-Wireless-Charging-Certified-Black/dp/B0D8SW4FDR\" target=\"_blank\">£89.99</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.de/Wireless-Charging-Compatible-Certified-Foldable-black/dp/B0D8SQJF1Z\" target=\"_blank\">€74,99</a>, which is $40 cheaper than the MagSafe ButterFly and $10 less than the ButterFly SE. That it comes with a cable, 40W charger and interchangeable international plug heads makes it even greater value for money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Folding Wireless Charging Station might not be as beautiful a design as the Twelve South ButterFly, or even as well named, but it’s an elegant and uncluttered compact solution that can charge more devices at the same time and just happens to be a little cheaper, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Highly portable, this is a minimalist wireless charging accessory that will be a boon to all owners of Apple Watch, iPhone, and AirPods, not only on their travels but at home or in the office, too.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f04cae1241fdd25bbb1881c348ac4db42c2a3d05dbd2fefa44fae81d9f4012db","category":"Apple"}
