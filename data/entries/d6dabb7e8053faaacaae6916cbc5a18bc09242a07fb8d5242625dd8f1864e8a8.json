And it looks like Apple is hoping for a bit of spring influence on iPad and Mac sales, as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-06/apple-prepares-m3-macbook-air-and-revamped-ipad-pro-for-early-next-year&amp;xcust=1-1-2164386-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple is planning to release new iPads and an M3 MacBook Air</a> by the end of March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad Air, which was last <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/625135/ipad-air-m1-review.html\">updated in March 2022</a>, will reportedly see the biggest change, with Apple launching a new 12.9-inch model to go along with the 10.9-inch version. Gurman did not mention any other updates to the iPad Air, but we can assume it will get a new chip as well, either the M2 or M3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the higher end, the iPad Pro models will get a major update to its displays. Gurman says Apple will replace both the LED screen in the 11-inch model and the mini-LED screen in the 12.9-inch model with OLED screens that offer a wider range of colors. Additionally, the M2 chip in both Pro models will be upgraded to the M3, which made its debut in the 14-inch MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To go along with the new iPad Pro, Gurman reports that Apple is “preparing revamped versions of the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard accessories.” The news of a revamped Apple Pencil is a bit surprising since Apple recently released a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2108888/apple-pencil-usb-c-features-price-comparison-ipad.html\">USB-C Apple Pencil</a>, though the Pro model with wireless charging hasn’t been updated since 2018. (Gurman does not clarify if the “revamped” Pencil will be in addition to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2156898/apple-pencil-compared-1st-2nd-gen-vs-usb-c.html\">three other Pencils Apple offers</a>, or if it will replace any of them, though it seems likely to be a replacement for the 2nd-gen model and possibly the 1st-gen too if Apple ditches the last remaining Lightning Pencil.) As for the new Magic Keyboard, Gurman says it “will make the iPad Pro look more like a laptop and include a sturdier frame with aluminum.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To top off the spring announcements, Apple will update the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air with the M3 chip. Apple introduced the M3 with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2120984/macbook-pro-lineup-with-m3-pro-max-processors-memory-specs.html\">14-inch MacBook Pro back in October</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iPad and Mac sales have been down in Apple’s recent quarterly fiscal results. Apple released new M3-based MacBook Pros and a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2126614/24-inch-imac-m3-review.html\">new iMac</a> for the holiday sales season, which could boost Mac sales for the current quarter, but none of Apple’s iPads have been updated in over a year. Apple regularly releases new products in the spring, but Apple’s recent sales numbers have put new focus on the company’s release schedule and how it can boost sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the rest of 2024, Gurman reports that Apple could unveil the Vision Pro “early next year.” Later in 2024, we could see an Apple Watch with blood pressure sensing, a new iPad mini, a new low-end iPad, revamped USB-C AirPods, and “larger upscale iPhones.”</p>\n\niPad, MacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d6dabb7e8053faaacaae6916cbc5a18bc09242a07fb8d5242625dd8f1864e8a8","category":"Apple"}
