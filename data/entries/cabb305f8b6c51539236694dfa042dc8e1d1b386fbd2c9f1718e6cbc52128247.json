It’s the most recognizable (IMO) and appealing of its offerings. The former OSTRO helped shape the mold for powerful road machines with a slippery silhouette. The new OSTRO doesn’t move far from the original starting point but goes all in on minute aero updates for larger gains. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Headtube-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Headtube-800x440.jpeg\" alt=\"OSTRO VAM Headtube front on\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Headtube-800x440.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Headtube-297x163.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Headtube-120x66.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Headtube-768x422.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Headtube-1536x845.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Headtube-2048x1126.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(All images: Factor Bikes)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The design team looked to balance stiffness/comfort, real-life wind, and beauty. The team added some cool extra bits like unique aero bottle cages and a new set of ultra-fast (and very good-looking) Black Ink 48/58 Wheels. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-zones-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-zones--800x465.jpeg\" alt=\" factor OSTRO VAM zones\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-zones--800x465.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-zones--297x173.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-zones--120x70.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-zones--768x446.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-zones--1536x893.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-zones-.jpeg 1676w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Factor OSTRO – Aero Makeover from Nose to Tail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing the 2024 OSTRO, Factor looked at every tube and focused on understanding how the bike’s shape could strategically guide air around the rider. They started at the leading edge and worked backward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While presenting the new OSTRO, the Factor design/aero team explained that Improvements at the front impact elements at the rear, creating a snowball effect of gains and losses. The Factor design team divided this aero-challenge into five ‘zones’ to achieve the most aerodynamic edge while maintaining the bike’s overall ride integrity.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-junction-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-junction--800x533.jpeg\" alt=\" factor OSTRO VAM junction\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-junction--800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-junction--297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-junction--120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-junction--768x512.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Zone 1 — Fork and Headtube </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The fork impacts the aerodynamics of the entire bike as the central part of the bike’s leading edge. The CDA (drag coefficient) was reduced by minimizing the frontal area and increasing shape efficiency. The newly reduced fork crown height improves the new OSTRO’s stiffness and feel. The ride feel and responsiveness are a hallmark of the OSTRO, and the team didn’t want to lose that feeling amid aero gains. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-HT-front-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-HT-front--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\" factor OSTRO VAM HT front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-HT-front--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-HT-front--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-HT-front--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-HT-front--768x576.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Factor gave the new OSTRO’s headtube a more hourglass shape, reducing the frontal area. Adding a nose on the headtube allowed the team to move the leading edge of the fork forward, creating a smoother transition for the nose with the headtube. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aero Fork on the inside:</strong> Small surface details were added on the inside of the fork leg that work with the rotating wheel to promote better flow. The dropout and brake mount surfaces are modeled to move the air from the axle. All these small details add up to create a nice chunk of aero-gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-HT-tt-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-HT-tt--800x533.jpeg\" alt=\" factor OSTRO VAM HT tt\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-HT-tt--800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-HT-tt--297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-HT-tt--120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-HT-tt--768x512.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Zone 3 — Headtube to Toptube </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated head tube made way for a look at the overall airflow coming to the top tube. The team focused on smoother flow from the headtube to the bike’s rear. A streamlined headtube-to-top-tube transition enhances flow attachment and a more slippery design. This slimmer top tube paves the way for an overall reduction in seat tube size for a streamlined profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-rear-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-rear--800x533.jpeg\" alt=\" factor OSTRO VAM rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-rear--800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-rear--297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-rear--120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-rear--768x512.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Zone 4 — Seat Tube </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the UCI has removed the 3:1 rule (about two years ago) for components and reduced the minimum tube thickness required, the design team at Factor could develop a slim seat tube that worked well with the aggressive tapering on the top tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-fast-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-fast--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"factor OSTRO VAM fast front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-fast--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-fast--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-fast--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-fast--768x576.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The team’s objective was to maintain stiffness while reducing frontal area. As a result, the lower sections of the seat tube remain as wide as the OSTRO frame. It tapers into the bottom bracket zone (zone 5) and requires additional carbon layup magic to combat the dreaded torsional flex.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ostro_2024_Team-Blue_detail_chain-stay.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ostro_2024_Team-Blue_detail_chain-stay-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"ostro_2024_Team Blue_detail_chain stay\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ostro_2024_Team-Blue_detail_chain-stay-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ostro_2024_Team-Blue_detail_chain-stay-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ostro_2024_Team-Blue_detail_chain-stay-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ostro_2024_Team-Blue_detail_chain-stay-768x512.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Zone 5 — Bottom Bracket</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The trend is to make the bottom bracket wider, taller, and slightly boxy (like the Trek Madone). Factor added their spin on this with the new OSTRO, creating a smooth yet boxy bottom bracket junction. The team started, <em>“Balancing shape efficiency and maintaining volume and rigidity is key to power transfer. Here, we had to manage the pedaling forces in one plane while promoting airflow retention in the other.” </em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-black--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"475\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-black--800x475.jpeg\" alt=\" factor OSTRO VAM black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-black--800x475.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-black--297x176.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-black--120x71.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-black--768x456.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-black--1536x912.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-black--2048x1216.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the height, the design team meticulously fine-tuned the volume above the bottom bracket, balancing airflow while keeping it tucked away from the riders’ legs. Once again, the Factor team found a slight gain in aerodynamic efficiency, adding another tick in the faster direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-white--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"475\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-white--800x475.jpeg\" alt=\" factor OSTRO VAM white\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-white--800x475.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-white--297x176.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-white--120x71.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-white--768x456.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-white--1536x912.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-white--2048x1216.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Black Ink 48/58 Wheels:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When Factor drops a new bike, it usually means another cool wheelset, and the BLK Inc 48/58 is no exception. The newest BLK Inc. wheels feature a high-flange carbon spoke hub and weight in at a super light (for this deep) 1270g. The wheelset is aero-designed and tested for maximal performance with 28mm tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-wheels-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"521\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-wheels--800x521.jpeg\" alt=\" factor OSTRO VAM wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-wheels--800x521.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-wheels--297x194.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-wheels--120x78.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-wheels--768x500.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-wheels-.jpeg 1194w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The increased leading-edge radius improves flow attachment at larger yaw angles, and the high-flange hub increases ride feel and lateral stiffness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Factor design team explains: <em>“The increased radius creates a more gradual rate of curvature change, promoting flow attachment at larger yaw angles. In addition, the rounder profile and more-gradual change in curvature means that the aerodynamic stall onset is gentler, giving the rider a better feeling of control in gusts and strong crosswind situations.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-botle-design-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"779\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-botle-design--800x779.jpeg\" alt=\" factor OSTRO VAM bottle design\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-botle-design--800x779.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-botle-design--297x289.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-botle-design--120x117.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-botle-design--768x748.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-botle-design-.jpeg 1358w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aero and Tube Specific Water Bottle Cages </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only are these new Factor/BLK Inc cages aero, but they are tube-specific. Like other aero cages, they do not require a specific bottle or an attachment. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-bottle-air-flow-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-bottle-air-flow--800x569.jpeg\" alt=\" factor OSTRO VAM bottle air flow\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-bottle-air-flow--800x569.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-bottle-air-flow--297x211.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-bottle-air-flow--120x85.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-bottle-air-flow--768x546.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-bottle-air-flow-.jpeg 976w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Black Ink–Tube Specific Bottle Cage: </strong>The BLK Inc OSTRO downtube cage bridges the gap between the downtube and the water bottle. It promotes longer flow attachment and reduces localized drag — plus, it holds a water bottle! </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-bottle-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"462\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-bottle--800x462.jpeg\" alt=\" factor OSTRO VAM bottle cage aero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-bottle--800x462.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-bottle--297x171.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-bottle--120x69.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-bottle--768x443.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-bottle-.jpeg 1396w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ostro Sprint Cage:</strong> The Factor design team chose a different aerodynamic approach for the Sprint Cage. It acts as a high-speed flow management device. Its most aerodynamically functional when a rider ejects their bottle before the final sprint. The foil profiles and precise spacing with the seat tube, funnel air tightly across the tube and transition it to the rear wheel. Making you faster for the times when it’s absolutely needed — like a tour stage or a town line sprint </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-CFD-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-CFD-800x440.jpeg\" alt=\"OSTRO VAM CFD team\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-CFD-800x440.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-CFD-297x163.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-CFD-120x66.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-CFD-768x422.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-CFD-1536x845.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-CFD-2048x1126.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Full Picture — Factor OSTRO 2024 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how much faster is the new Factor OSTRO compared to the previous generation? The new design saves 7 watts. Now I know what you’re thinking: “All that for 7 watts?!” But that’s a lot when it comes to an already super-aero bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Factory-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Factory-800x440.jpeg\" alt=\"OSTRO VAM CFD factory\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Factory-800x440.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Factory-297x163.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Factory-120x66.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Factory-768x422.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Factory-1536x845.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Factory-2048x1126.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Factor design team explains: <em>“As for aerodynamics, the net gain is roughly a 10% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency with all variables controlled and normalized in a wind tunnel. This is, on average, a 70-gram reduction in drag vs. the original OSTRO. This is about 7 watts at 48km/h, which converges with our simulation data. In addition, the aerodynamic benefit increases as yaw angles become closer to real-world expectations (5-10 degrees).” </em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Stevie-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Stevie-800x440.jpeg\" alt=\"OSTRO VAM Stevie TDU\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Stevie-800x440.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Stevie-297x163.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Stevie-120x66.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Stevie-768x422.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Stevie-1536x845.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OSTRO-VAM-Stevie-2048x1126.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2> Factor OSTRO VAM — Prices and Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Factor OSTRO VAM is available exclusively from <a href=\"http://factorbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">factorbikes.com</a> and authorized Factor dealers worldwide. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-pricing-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-pricing--800x336.jpeg\" alt=\"factor OSTRO VAM pricing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-pricing--800x336.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-pricing--297x125.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-pricing--120x50.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-pricing--768x322.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-pricing--1536x645.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/factor-OSTRO-VAM-pricing--2048x860.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Factor OSTRO is available as a frameset, a ‘rolling frameset’ with Black Inc 48/58 disc brake carbon wheelset, or a complete bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sizes: </strong>The New Factor OSTRO is available in sizes 45, 49, 52, 54, 56, 58, and 61cm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paint options: </strong>Gloss Chrome, and Pearl White</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em> <a href=\"http://factorbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">factorbikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/factor-ostro-gets-comprehensive-aero-upgrade/\">From Nose to Tail: Factor OSTRO Gets Comprehensive Aero Upgrade</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"cabb305f8b6c51539236694dfa042dc8e1d1b386fbd2c9f1718e6cbc52128247","category":"Cycling"}
