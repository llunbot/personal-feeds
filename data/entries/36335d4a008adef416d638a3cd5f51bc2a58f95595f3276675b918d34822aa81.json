Thanks to the porting over of elements of road-going Red’s components (levers, brakes and crankset) and some fancy machining on the cassette, the groupset is light at a claimed 2,488g as well. Never mind gravel bikes, Red XPLR AXS makes the strongest case to date for 1x gearing on the road, but therein lies its problem – it uses SRAM’s UDH standard, meaning not every bike is compatible with it yet (though things only look to be going SRAM’s way in future). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Red XPLR AXS’s full-mount rear derailleur is a true step forward in design, being robust, serviceable and easy to setup, and the brand should receive bonus brownie points for fitting 13 sprockets into 12-speed spacing, so preexisting chains and freehubs can be used, as opposed to more standards and SKUs being created. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t perfect – the nature of the full-mount derailleur means there can only be one cassette option, which isn’t the widest range and alone costs £600, so proper drivetrain maintenance is essential to stop running costs from becoming prohibitive. The cost of the groupset more generally – retailing for £3,980 / €4,465 / $3,979 – is hard to stomach, but thankfully the future looks bright, given that SRAM has a track record of trickling its AXS technology down to more affordable price points with little change in performance. As such, Red XPLR AXS gets my gear of the year vote just as much for what it heralds as what it actually is. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-xplr-axs-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">full review of SRAM Red XPLR AXS</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>James Spender, deputy editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>SRAM Red AXS (in particular braking/the brake calliper) </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"SRAM Red AXS groupset brakes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/sram-red-axs-2024-review-12.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest SRAM Red is absolutely superb. It’s not a huge step up from the outgoing Red AXS – less due to lack of innovation, more due to old Red being very good already – but it makes my list for its improved braking and new styling and machining. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the latter, groupsets are your bike jewels and we are vain cyclists after all (I know I am anyway), so with Shimano laying unchanged in 2024 and the new Campagnolo dividing opinion in looks, SRAM has stolen a march for its exceptionally clean looks. It’s like Terminator made brake callipers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the former, braking has been vastly improved in the main thanks to repositioned lever pivots and increased distances from pads to rotors. The result is superb modulation – the feeling of proportional progress; the harder you squeeze, the more braking force is applied – and genuine, as billed by SRAM ‘one finger braking’. Once Campagnolo could count itself leader of the braking pack, but with the new Red, SRAM has drawn level, maybe even outstripping it. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">full review of SRAM Red AXS</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+5\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-5-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-5-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-5-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-5-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-5-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-5-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-5-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-5-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Unifying bolt sizes (Canyon Aeroad, Scott Addict RC use the same size bolt throughout pretty much) </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ZFM_0051-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ZFM_0051-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ZFM_0051-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ZFM_0051-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ZFM_0051-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ZFM_0051-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ZFM_0051-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ZFM_0051-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ZFM_0051-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ZFM_0051-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/ZFM_0051-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Two very exciting bikes have stood out this year for one very boring reason: bolts. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-aeroad-cfr-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon’s new Aeroad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/scott-addict-rc-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Scott’s latest Addict RC</a> both use T25 torx bolts in all the major places (seat clamp, stem bolts and bottle mounts etc) and as such the bikes can be on-the-road maintained with just one tool, which can then handily be stashed on the bike. In Scott’s case that’s in a bar end; in Canyon’s it’s part of the thru-axle.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eagle eyed viewers will be wondering what of such thru-axles, but said tools also nattily incorporate 6mm allen keys too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why should you care? You might be like me and resent having to swap between multiple tools just to tighten up a headset. Or you might just care that, like USB-C, the sooner we can ubiquitise stuff the sooner we can make easy savings in terms of environmental impact. Boring reasons, boring innovation, doesn’t make you faster or better looking.

First of all, the two mounts provided by Knog give riders the flexibility to attach onto near enough any handlebar, or go for the sleek out-front Go Pro attachment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The light itself is beautifully designed: a cold slab of machined aluminium that fits in the hand, complete with a ridged exterior to aid with grip, and provide contours for the mount to attach onto. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Battery life is good, the beams are varied and 1,600 lumens was plenty for all my different uses. Scrolling through functionality is taken care of by just one-button, so is pretty much idiot proof. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear light is slightly less deluxe in its constituent parts, with a plastic body and simple stretchy black rubber bands used for securing the light, but performance is similarly strong and the variety of bands ensures that it will fit any seat post.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-gear-of-the-year-2024-tech\">Cyclist’s Gear of the Year 2024: Tech</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"36335d4a008adef416d638a3cd5f51bc2a58f95595f3276675b918d34822aa81","category":"Cycling"}
