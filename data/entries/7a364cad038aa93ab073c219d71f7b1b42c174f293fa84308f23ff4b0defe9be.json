During the trial, Milton was accused of lying about “nearly all aspects of the business,” CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/us-prosecutors-charge-trevor-milton-founder-of-electric-carmaker-nikola-with-three-counts-of-fraud.html\">reported</a>.</p>\n<p>From 2016 to 2020, Milton's \"extravagant claims\" were fueled by a desire to pump up the value of Nikola stock, The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/18/business/ev-startups-trevor-milton-nikola.html\">reported</a>. He was accused of misleading investors about everything from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/nikola-admits-prototype-was-rolling-downhill-in-promotional-video/\">fake prototypes of emission-free long-haul trucks</a> to billions worth of supposedly binding orders for hydrogen fuel cells and batteries that were never shipped. In a sentencing memo, prosecutors said that Milton targeted \"less sophisticated investors,\" the Times reported, engaging \"in a sustained scheme to take advantage of\" their inexperience.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991793#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991793&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7a364cad038aa93ab073c219d71f7b1b42c174f293fa84308f23ff4b0defe9be","category":"Tech"}
