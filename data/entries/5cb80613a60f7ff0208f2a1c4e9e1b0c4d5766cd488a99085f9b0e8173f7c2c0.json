{"title":"Mike Masnick: ‘The Surgeon General Is Wrong; Social Media Doesn’t Need Warning Labels’","link":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-surgeon-general-is-wrong-social-media-doesnt-need-warning-labels","date":1718841173000,"content":"\n<p>Mike Masnick, writing for The Daily Beast:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We put health warnings on things that are <em>inherently</em> harmful,\nwith little redeeming health value. That is, things that are\nactually toxins: nicotine, lead, poisons.</p>\n\n<p>The complaints here are with <em>speech</em>. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The American Psychological Association <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/topics/social-media-internet/health-advisory-adolescent-social-media-use\">released a similar\nreport</a>, concluding: “Using social media is not inherently\nbeneficial or harmful to young people.” Instead, it finds that\nwhen young people struggle with mental health, their online lives\nare often just a reflection of their offline lives.</p>\n\n<p>Lots of other research has shown the same thing, yet Murthy’s call\nfor health warnings never mentions all of this research that\nsuggests social media is actually beneficial for many. Instead, he\ncites a few anecdotes of children who were bullied online. But\nbullying happened prior to social media, and we did not talk about\nputting health warnings on telephones or notepads or other forms\nof communication.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just pure panic-driven ninny-ism. It’s like <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/what-if-trigger-warnings-dont-work\">the whole nonsense with “trigger warnings”</a>. Masnick brings up Reagan-era Surgeon General <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/postscript-c-everett-koop-1916-2013\">C. Everett Koop</a>’s nonsensical crusade against video games in the 1980s. I’m also reminded of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2005/01/11/4279560/tipper-gore-and-family-values\">Tipper Gore’s campaign</a> for warning labels on music albums.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/19/surgeon-general-social-media\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5cb80613a60f7ff0208f2a1c4e9e1b0c4d5766cd488a99085f9b0e8173f7c2c0","category":"Tech"}
