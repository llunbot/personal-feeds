Instead, a child’s height and inseam measurement are more critical to ensure a proper fit. Balance bikes are typically suited for children under 110cm, although this varies across models.</p>\n<p>Don’t be tempted to buy a larger bike that is too big for your child because it will make it hard for them to manoeuvre and will likely be uncomfortable, ultimately hampering the learning experience.</p>\n<p>Balance bikes typically use a 12-inch wheel size, but you can find options with 10-inch wheels for smaller children, and 14-inch wheels for taller children.</p>\n<h3>Is a balance bike better than a conventional children’s bike?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Child on a balance bike on a path\" title=\"Child on a balance bike on a path\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A balance bike will teach a child how to balance and lean – valuable skills when it comes to riding a pedal-powered bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Catherine Falls Commercial / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p><span>A balance bike typically represents an easier first step into </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/how-to-teach-a-child-to-cycle-in-30-minutes/\">teaching your child to cycle</a><span> for toddlers.

That way, there is one learning curve to cycling rather than two, but we’d recommend a balance bike as the entry point for young children.</p>\n<h3>Balance bike vs stabilisers</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Striding will lead to gliding\" title=\"li2837655-spz24.balance.dsc-1513685936429-1c9hj8nnjgj1x-a152335\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Striding will lead to gliding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>We’d recommend starting a young child on a balance bike, rather than using stabilisers (also known as ‘training wheels’).</p>\n<p>As balance bikes teach young children to balance, it often makes for a simpler transition to a kids’ bike without the need for stabilisers when they are older.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Toddler on bicycle with stabilisers\" title=\"Toddler on bicycle with stabilisers\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We’d recommend starting on a balance bike, rather than using stabilisers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Peter Cade / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>On a balance bike, children learn the art of cornering, how to steer and sometimes correct braking techniques (provided the bike has been specced with a rear brake).</p>\n<p>Stabilisers effectively turn a kid’s bike into a tricycle, offering very different characteristics when cornering, which can complicate matters when stepping up to riding solely on two wheels, and having to learn how to balance on a bike from scratch.</p>\n<h3>What to look for in a balance bike</h3>\n<h4>Frame material</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Balance bikes are a great way for children to learn to cycle\" title=\"li2837658-spz24.balance._ds-1513685936425-7mqy3gmejvx8-144f649\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The majority of balance bikes will be made from wood or aluminium with some composite exceptions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A balance bike frame will typically be made from metal, in many cases steel or, with lighter options, aluminium.

Some frames are made of wood, which is lightweight and suitable for riding indoors, but it may not stand up to long-term abuse outside.</p>\n<h4>Brakes</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Balance bikes are great for learning how to ride, but won't work for longer distances.\" title=\"2-1513090515485-lxjrkvbndrg0-7fa3c74\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Not all balance bikes feature brakes, with some requiring feet to be dragged to slow down.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oli Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Some balance bikes feature a rear brake. This is particularly useful when riding outside, so the child can stop without using their feet. Balance bikes with a brake also represent a gateway in developing a child’s braking technique when it comes to stepping up to a pedal-powered bike.</p>\n<h4>Wheels</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"BikeRadar staffers are huge proponents of teaching kids how to ride by first estalishing balance with kick bikes\" title=\"1409693998659-paux5ja60obm-680389e\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some balance bikes feature wooden wheels.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As you spend more, the quality of the wheels and tyres improves. Cheaper balance bikes will use plastic rims that can easily go out of true (roundness), whereas more premium options will use aluminium rims and sealed-bearing hubs, laced with spokes that can be adjusted should the wheel go out of true.</p>\n<h4>Tyres</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Propain Bam Bam balance bike disc brake mount\" title=\"Propain Bam Bam balance bike disc brake mount\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pneumatic tyres will make for a more comfortable ride.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Propain / Stefan Eigner</i></span></div>\n<p>Cheaper balance bikes use foam tyres, which won’t puncture but don’t offer a particularly exciting or grippy ride outside. More expensive balance bikes will feature dedicated tyres designed for tarmac or paths, with improved grip and durability.</p>\n<h4>Contact points</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Islabikes balance saddle\" title=\"Islabikes balance saddle\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Scooped saddles should make scooting the bike easier.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Islabikes</i></span></div>\n<p>Good-quality balance bikes will feature a seatpost or a handlebar that allows height adjustment. Some may offer a quick-release clamp for easier adjustment. Either way, adjustable contact points will allow you to fine-tune the fit, and adjust the bike as a child grows.</p>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"633642c19bbfad385e7382ef4bb195c7b65e4f0ed4d86b1dd7b99e67988bf705","category":"Cycling"}
