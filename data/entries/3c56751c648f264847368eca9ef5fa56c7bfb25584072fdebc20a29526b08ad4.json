{"title":"Check your mail, because Apple may send you a $395 check this week","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2418557/check-your-mail-because-apple-may-send-you-a-395-check-this-week.html","date":1722874762000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s switch to its own chips in 2020 didn’t just deliver greater speed and efficiency to the MacBook lineup. It also brought the 16-inch model’s Magic Keyboard to the rest of the lineup, closing the book on one of the most maligned hardware designs in Apple’s history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The butterfly keyboard was so bad that Apple issued a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673631/macbook-recalls-and-repair-programs-is-your-mac-included.html\">service program</a> in 2018 that covered every model ever made and had to answer to a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1418678/macbook-butterfly-keyboard-settlement-faq-payments.html\">class action lawsuit</a> that resulted in a $50 million settlement in early 2023. Now, those checks are finally starting to go out to affected customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the terms of the settlement, Apple distributed about $33 million to users, with the highest payout being $395. For a refresher, there were three groups in the class:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Group 1 ($395):</strong> If you repaired your MacBook keyboard two or more times through Apple or an Authorized Service Provider within four years of purchase.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Group 2 ($125):</strong> If you repaired your MacBook keyboard once through Apple or an Authorized Service Provider within four years of purchase.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Group 3 ($50):</strong> If you repaired keycaps through Apple or an Authorized Service Provider.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Groups 2 and 3 needed to file a claim form to receive payment, but members of the first group will automatically be sent checks if they lived in California, New York, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Washington, or Michigan when they bought their MacBook. So whether you filed a claim or not, check you mail because Apple might be sending you a check.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3c56751c648f264847368eca9ef5fa56c7bfb25584072fdebc20a29526b08ad4","category":"Apple"}
