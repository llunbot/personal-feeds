On one end of the spectrum are $1,000-ish tablets like the <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=fl7OML4te6w&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=ArsECSMiniPC&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-x%2F8xtmb6c575md%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab\" target=\"_blank\">Surface Pro X</a>, which, especially for indie developers, is a lot of cash to drop just to dabble in a new hardware ecosystem. And while you <em>can</em> technically run Windows 10 and 11 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/new-script-makes-it-easyish-to-put-windows-10-or-11-on-a-raspberry-pi/\" target=\"_blank\">on a Raspberry Pi 4</a>, performance even on a 4 GB or 8 GB Pi leaves a lot to be desired (it's also not actually permitted by Windows' licensing restrictions).</p>\n<p>But there's now a solution to this problem in the form of the <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=fl7OML4te6w&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=ArsECSMiniPC&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fecs-liva-mini-box-qc710-desktop%2F8z247h1h3skp%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab\" target=\"_blank\">ECS LIVA QC710</a>, an unassuming Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered Windows mini PC that is currently available in the Microsoft Store for a relatively reasonable $219. The box ships with the ARM version of Windows 10 Home, and at 1.38×4.69×4.59 inches is comparable in size to a set-top box like the Apple TV.</p>\n      <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qc710-front-980x551.jpeg\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          One of the QC710's USB ports and its microSD card slot are located on its side.

It includes just 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of (presumable eMMC) storage, expandable only via a microSD slot on the side. The <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-7c-compute-platform\">Snapdragon 7c</a> chip is also a step down from the <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-8c-compute-platform\">Snapdragon 8c</a>, <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-8cx-gen-2-5g-compute-platform\">8cx</a>, SQ1, and SQ2 chips that power tablets like the Surface Pro X. The SoC includes a pair of \"big\" Kryo 468 Gold cores and six \"little\" Kryo 468 Silver cores, plus an Adreno 618 GPU, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 5 support. Connectivity is limited to a single 5 Gbps USB Type-A port, one USB 2.0 port, an HDMI port, and a 100 Mbps Ethernet port, plus a USB-C port that's used for power.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813294#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813294&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"edcd2835c11a2172fc7b2638d34485bdb78820ba13c0abd0eb27127ac6a73857","category":"Tech"}
