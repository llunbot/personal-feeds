that will come as a shock to absolutely nobody, UAE Team Emirates’ <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a> is dominating in his debut Giro d’Italia. Today is a rest day at Italy’s Grand Tour but don’t discount him beating his teammates on any rest day rides just to emphasise his superiority.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar has held the <em>maglia rosa</em> since his breakaway win back on Stage 2. He took further stage wins back to back on Stage 7’s time-trial and the mountainous Stage 8 to further consolidate his lead heading into the second week. He even found the energy to lead out his team’s sprint train in the final few hundred metres of yesterday’s sprint stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking of sprinters, Tim Merlier (Soudal-QuickStep) and Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) won Stages 3 and 4 respectively, while Visma-Lease a Bike’s Olav Kooij pipped Milan on the line for his maiden win on Stage 9 after reeling in a late attack from Jhonatan Narváez (Ineos Grenadiers). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some breakaway attempts have been successful, however. Benjamin Thomas secured Cofidis’s first victory of the season on Stage 5, while Movistar’s Pelayo Sanchez broke French hearts by outsprinting Julian Alaphilippe (Soudal-QuickStep) at the finish line the following day.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first week of the Giro d’Italia has also seen some big names forced to withdraw already. Biniam Girmay (Intermarché-Wanty) hit the ground twice in a few kilometres on Stage 4, leading him to abandon the race, while Visma-Lease a Bike have also lost Robert Gesink and Christophe Laporte.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The race reconvenes tomorrow for Stage 10, a 141.2km ride from Pompei to Cusano Mutri (Bocca della Selva). As yet, there’s no decision on a possible re-route away from the Stelvio on Stage 16, which is still covered in snow in places, with the risk of a potential avalanche even if the road is cleared in time.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Demi Vollering wins Itzulia Women </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Demi-Vollering-wins-Itzulia-Women-2024-Alex-Broadway-via-Getty-Images-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Demi-Vollering-wins-Itzulia-Women-2024-Alex-Broadway-via-Getty-Images-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Demi-Vollering-wins-Itzulia-Women-2024-Alex-Broadway-via-Getty-Images-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Demi-Vollering-wins-Itzulia-Women-2024-Alex-Broadway-via-Getty-Images-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Demi-Vollering-wins-Itzulia-Women-2024-Alex-Broadway-via-Getty-Images-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Demi-Vollering-wins-Itzulia-Women-2024-Alex-Broadway-via-Getty-Images-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Demi-Vollering-wins-Itzulia-Women-2024-Alex-Broadway-via-Getty-Images-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Demi-Vollering-wins-Itzulia-Women-2024-Alex-Broadway-via-Getty-Images-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Demi-Vollering-wins-Itzulia-Women-2024-Alex-Broadway-via-Getty-Images-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Demi-Vollering-wins-Itzulia-Women-2024-Alex-Broadway-via-Getty-Images-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/Demi-Vollering-wins-Itzulia-Women-2024-Alex-Broadway-via-Getty-Images-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Alex Broadway/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Demi Vollering won the three-day Itzulia Women in another display of team dominance. It means that, since the race started in 2022, every single stage has been won by SD-Worx. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It started two years ago when Vollering swept all three stages on her way to the overall. Then last year she shared the spoils with teammate Marlen Reusser (two for Vollering, one for Reusser), with Reusser winning overall. Finally, this year it was teammate Mischa Bredewold who kicked things off, winning back-to-back stages, before Vollering took Stage 3 and the overall.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mark Cavendish bags second win of season </h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3c6.png\" alt=\"🏆\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6b4-200d-2642-fe0f.png\" alt=\"🚴‍♂️\" /> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkCavendish?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@MarkCavendish</a> wins the second stage of Tour de Hongrie!<br /><br />The legend himself <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44f.png\" alt=\"👏\" /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TourdeHongrie?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#TourdeHongrie</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wGJSSsF8q1\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/wGJSSsF8q1</a></p>— Eurosport (@eurosport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eurosport/status/1788580834393411827?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">May 9, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>In an encouraging sign that he is returning to form, Mark Cavendish (Astana Qazaqstan) sprinted to Stage 2 honours at the Tour de Hongrie, scaling a Category 3 climb with less than 25km to the finish in the process. His teammates were slightly disjointed in the final 2km but Cavendish sat on the wheel of trusted Michael Mørkøv and opened his sprint in the last 150m.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish crossed the line first in front of a speedy Dylan Groenewegen (Jayco-AlUla). The Dutch rider would later be penalised for obstructing Sam Welsford (Bora-Hansgrohe), be given a CHF200 fine (about £175), a ten-second penalty and a 20% points deduction. Despite that, he kept his second place.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is win #35 coming for Cavendish at the Tour de France? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you next week.  </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-2024-giro-ditalia-pogacar\">Pro Log: Tadej Pogačar is dominating the Giro, Demi Vollering victorious at Itzulia, Mark Cavendish back to winning ways </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f2116b8675286e02f25c420c4fb231a3c68f2757b5a99d3c76aa99f0b22309f6","category":"Cycling"}
