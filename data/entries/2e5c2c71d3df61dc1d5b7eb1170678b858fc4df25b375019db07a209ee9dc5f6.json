The courses are part of the <a href=\"https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/public/learning_plan/view/2207/amazon-q-generative-ai-powered-assistant-learning-plan\">Amazon Q learning plan</a>. But that’s not all that happened last week.</p> \n<p><strong><span>Last week’s launches<br /> </span></strong>Here are some launches that got my attention:</p> \n<p><strong>LlamaIndex support for Amazon Neptune </strong>— You can now build Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) applications by combining knowledge graphs stored in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/\">Amazon Neptune</a> and <a href=\"https://www.llamaindex.ai/\">LlamaIndex</a>, a popular open source framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs) such as those available in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a>. To learn more, check the <a href=\"https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/index_structs/knowledge_graph/NeptuneDatabaseKGIndexDemo/\">LlamaIndex documentation for Amazon Neptune Graph Store</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS CloudFormation launches a new parameter called DeletionMode for the DeleteStack API</strong> — You can use the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">AWS CloudFormation</a> DeleteStack API to delete your stacks and stack resources. However, certain stack resources can prevent the DeleteStack API from successfully completing, for example, when you attempt to delete non-empty <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a> buckets. The DeleteStack API can enter into the DELETE_FAILED state in such scenarios. With this launch, you can now pass FORCE_DELETE_STACK value to the new DeletionMode parameter and delete such stacks. To learn more, check the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-cli-deleting-stack.html\">DeleteStack API documentation</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Mistral Small now available in Amazon Bedrock</strong> — The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/mistral/\">Mistral Small</a> foundation model (FM) from <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/\">Mistral AI</a> is now generally available in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a>. This a fast-follow to our recent announcements of Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B in March, and Mistral Large in April. Mistral Small, developed by Mistral AI, is a highly efficient large language model (LLM) optimized for high-volume, low-latency language-based tasks. To learn more, check <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/optimized-for-low-latency-workloads-mistral-small-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/\">Esra’s post.</a></p> \n<p><strong>New Amazon CloudFront edge location in Cairo, Egypt </strong>— The new AWS edge location brings the full suite of benefits provided by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\">Amazon CloudFront</a>, a secure, highly distributed, and scalable content delivery network (CDN) that delivers static and dynamic content, APIs, and live and on-demand video with low latency and high performance. Customers in Egypt can expect up to 30 percent improvement in latency, on average, for data delivered through the new edge location. To learn more about AWS edge locations, visit <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features\">CloudFront edge locations</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon OpenSearch Service zero-ETL integration with Amazon S3 </strong>— This <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/\">Amazon OpenSearch Service</a> integration offers a new efficient way to query operational logs in Amazon S3 data lakes, eliminating the need to switch between tools to analyze data. You can get started by installing out-of-the-box dashboards for AWS log types such as Amazon VPC Flow Logs, AWS WAF Logs, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB).
