Trading in the iPhone 12 Pro Max, for example, will now net you $700, $90 less than it was worth yesterday.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/iphone-12-vs-iphone-12-mini.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWith Apple's trade-in program, customers can send in their old devices and receive an Apple gift card that can be put toward the purchase of a new device. Apple regularly adjusts trade-in pricing, and the new amounts for iPhones are listed below.\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone 12 Pro Max - Up to $700, down from $790</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone 12 Pro - Up to $600, down from $640</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone 12 - Up to $450, down from $530</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone 12 mini - Up to $350, down from $400</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone SE (2nd generation) - Up to $160, down from $170</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone 11 Pro Max - Up to $450, down from $500</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone 11 Pro - Up to $400, down from $450</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone 11 - Up to $300, down from $340</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone XS Max - Up to $280, down from $320</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone XS - Up to $220, down from $240</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone XR - Up to $200, down from $230</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone X - Up to $200 (no change)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone 8 Plus - Up to $160, down from $180</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone 8 - Up to $100, down from $110</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone 7 Plus - Up to $100, down from $110</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone 7 - Up to $40, down from $50</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone 6s Plus - Up to $50, down from $60</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>iPhone 6s - Up to $30 (no change)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\nApple has also dropped trade-in prices for tablets and computers. For tablets, customers can now receive up to $550, down from a previous $580 maximum. For computers, Apple is offering up to $2720, down from $3240. Maximum trade-in prices have not changed from the Apple Watch and users can still receive up to $270.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe trade-in prices listed in this article are Apple's maximums for each product and represent the amount you'll receive for a device in perfect condition. Trade-in prices drop based on device condition.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple offers trade-ins for both Apple devices and devices from other companies such as Samsung, and prices vary based on the original cost of the device, the device's age, the device's condition, and other factors. It's worth noting that most people will be able to find better trade-in deals elsewhere, with the best prices available from selling devices directly to another person using a site like eBay or Swappa.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Thanks, Andy!)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-trade-in/\">Apple trade-in</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/apple-drops-trade-in-prices/\">Apple Drops Device Trade-In Prices in the U.S.</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-drops-device-trade-in-prices-in-the-u-s.2322623/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=y4d4iP35Sxw:qk3YN0lCAE4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=y4d4iP35Sxw:qk3YN0lCAE4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa062e62fa7ab4d7c54e96ce33b912391af65c1428a910739af167d6e8254219","category":"Apple"}
