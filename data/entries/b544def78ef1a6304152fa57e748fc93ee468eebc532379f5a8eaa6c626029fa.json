It works a bit like blood clotting to prevent bleeding. There are two main types: latex-based and latex-free.</p>\n<h3>Latex-based sealant</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"BAT are a South African brand with a Latex based tyre sealant.\" title=\"BAT Tyre Sealant\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> BAT is a South African brand with a latex-based tyre sealant.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Most sealants use the coagulating properties of natural latex to clog punctures. Latex is a dispersion of polymers (long-chain molecules) in either water or a water-based solution of ammonia. Inside a hole in the tyre, the air pressure drops and there is a rush of air. This causes the water/ammonia solution to evaporate, leaving the latex molecules to coagulate (knit together), plugging the hole.</p>\n<p>The problem with latex-based sealants is that, as air is pumped in and out of the tyre during normal use, the water/ammonia solution slowly evaporates. This causes the latex to coagulate inside the tyre carcass, resulting in a dried-up mess, which after a few months, won’t seal punctures.</p>\n<p>Most latex-based sealants also contain small particles, such as glitter or small fibres, suspended in the liquid.</p>\n<p>These help to provide a surface for the latex to coagulate around (like how snowflakes form around a particle of dust), thereby helping it seal holes more quickly and effectively. The downside is these particles accelerate the rate at which latex coagulates inside the tyre, reducing its lifespan.</p>\n<h3>Latex-free sealants</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Juice Lubes sealant bottles\" title=\"Juice Lubes sealant bottles\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This Juice Lubes sealant uses an ammonia-free, synthetic latex.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>These have no latex and no chemical change occurs inside the tyre. Instead, they rely on a more viscous (thicker) liquid, containing a wider variety of sealing particles, designed to physically plug punctures.</p>\n<p>These last far longer inside the tyre, but, in our experience, don’t plug punctures as well.</p>\n<h3>Road, gravel and mountain bike tubeless sealant</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Movistar Team mechanic fitting a Continental GP5000 S R tubeless tyre to a Zipp wheel\" title=\"20230525_SvB_EOS R__O5A9389\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Road riders will need less sealant in their tyres than mountain bikers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The majority of tubeless sealants we’ve tested here are suitable for use in road, mountain and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">gravel bike tyres</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pirelli-tubeless-tyre-sealant/\">Pirelli has released specific road, gravel and mountain bike tubeless sealants</a>, but this is the exception, not the rule.</p>\n<p>You’ll just have to adjust the dosage to account for the different wheel and tyre sizes, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>\n<p>For example, Stan’s No Tubes recommends 118ml to 148ml for various <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/mountain-bike-wheel-sizes-26in-650b-and-29in-explained/\">mountain bike wheels sizes</a>. The brand says 59ml of tubeless sealant suffices for everything from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-wheels/\">road bike wheels</a> to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/650b-vs-700c-for-gravel/\">650b gravel wheels.</a></p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h4>How we tested </h4>\n<p>The problem with real-world testing is that it’s impossible to test each sealant in the same conditions. </p>\n<p>The tyre, temperature and the type or position of the puncture all affect the sealant’s ability to seal. </p>\n<p>Therefore, we performed comparative tests in our workshop, controlling the variables as much as possible.</p>\n<p>In the first test, we used two Michelin Wild Grip’R 2 tyres, and tested three sealants with each tyre. </p>\n<p>After we’d finished testing a sealant, we cleaned the tyre thoroughly with water and rags, plugged the existing holes in the tyre with tape, and tested the next sealant on a different section of tyre. </p>\n<p>To begin, we poured 100ml of each sealant into the tyre (27.5×2.3in) and inflated it to 30psi, ensuring the tyre was thoroughly coated. </p>\n<p>We then stabbed the tyre on the outer casing, between the tread blocks, using a pick and different-sized screwdrivers.</p>\n<p>We measured how much air was lost from our 30psi starting point. </p>\n<p>In our second test, our workshop manager Will Poole used a Vittoria Rubino Pro Graphene 2.0 tyre in a 30mm width.</p>\n<p>He set up the tyre with each sealant and inflated it to 80psi. </p>\n<p>He then took turns with pins, a flat-headed screwdriver, a pick and a sharp knife to stab the tyre.</p>\n<p>Will recorded the number of blows the sealant withstood and the size of the incisions it sealed. </p>\n<p>After switching sharp implements, he reinflated the tyre to 80psi. Between sealants, Will cleaned and patched the tyre. </p>\n<p>The tubeless sealants that sealed the biggest holes, or held the most pressure with a given size of hole, were deemed to perform the best. </p>\n<p>We also considered the cost per unit volume, ecological impact and presence of allergens when scoring the tubeless sealants.</p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>","author":"Seb Stott","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"b544def78ef1a6304152fa57e748fc93ee468eebc532379f5a8eaa6c626029fa","category":"Cycling"}
