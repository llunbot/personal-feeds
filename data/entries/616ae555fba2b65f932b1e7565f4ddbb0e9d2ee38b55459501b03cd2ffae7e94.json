That means, in situations where you aren't being creepy, using your watch to record a note to self, a conversation, a bit of a song, or whatever else on your watch. You can then play the recording back and get the transcription on your Pixel phone.</p>\n<p>The other feature that isn't about running a marathon or asking a language model for help is UWB (ultra wideband) phone unlocking with the Pixel Watch 3. That should mean relatively responsive unlocks on your phone, but not if you're a measurably far distance from it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042621#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042621&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"616ae555fba2b65f932b1e7565f4ddbb0e9d2ee38b55459501b03cd2ffae7e94","category":"Tech"}
