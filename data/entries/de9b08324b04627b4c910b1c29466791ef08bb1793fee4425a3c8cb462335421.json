As expected, it was a down quarter — though at a 1%\ndrop over the year-ago quarter, it’s a better result than the\nprevious quarter, which was down 3% year-over-year. The company\nreported $81.8B in revenue and $19.9B in profit.</p>\n\n<p>The three key hardware categories were all down year-over-year:\nMac was down 7%, iPad was down 20%, and the all-important iPhone\nwas down 2%. Things were a little different in the two portions of\nApple’s business that have shown indefatigable growth in recent\nyears: Services revenue was up 8% and the Wearables, Home, and\nAccessories category was up 2%.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/08/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/\">a press release accompanying the results</a>, Apple CFO\nLuca Maestri trumpeted that it has broken the billion paid\nsubscriptions barrier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No big surprises. Still lots of switchers coming to iPhone and Mac, and a lot of first-time iPad buyers. That, to me, is a healthy pulse check.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/apple-q3-2023-results\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"de9b08324b04627b4c910b1c29466791ef08bb1793fee4425a3c8cb462335421","category":"Tech"}
