Once Dan made it back home to Washington he started Forager Cycles and launched the lovely Cable Cherry, then a crossbar-style handlebar named the Oyster bar. At the end of 2021, Dan told me he was working on a new steel handlebar design with a 35mm rise, 27-degree backsweep, and a 6-degree upsweep and asked if we’d like to try it to provide some feedback before the launch; I said I had the bike just for that—a recently acquired a 1994 Specialized Stumpjumper M2—which was sporting a very long stem and very narrow bars, and I was looking for a replacement for the latter.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1866\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1.-Cover-maybe_-Copy-of-1-13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1.-Cover-maybe_-Copy-of-1-13.jpg?w=1866&amp;quality=75 1866w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1.-Cover-maybe_-Copy-of-1-13.jpg?resize=1024,732&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1.-Cover-maybe_-Copy-of-1-13.jpg?resize=768,549&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1.-Cover-maybe_-Copy-of-1-13.jpg?resize=1800,1286&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1.-Cover-maybe_-Copy-of-1-13.jpg?resize=1335,954&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1.-Cover-maybe_-Copy-of-1-13.jpg?resize=700,500&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1.-Cover-maybe_-Copy-of-1-13.jpg?resize=1536,1097&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1866\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-1.jpg?w=1866&amp;quality=75 1866w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-1.jpg?resize=1024,732&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-1.jpg?resize=768,549&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-1.jpg?resize=1800,1286&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-1.jpg?resize=1335,954&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-1.jpg?resize=700,500&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-1.jpg?resize=1536,1097&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Two sets of bars arrived in January 2022 and Karla and I have been riding them on a variety of terrain and bikes since. The bars first testing ground was on our Stumpjumper and Rockhopper from the 90s; more recently we’ve been riding them on our modern bikepacking rigs, mine at 800mm wide (cut down from the original 850mm) and Karla’s at 740mm, which is the narrowest recommended width. After a few name changes due to availability, the bar has been recently baptized “the <a href=\"https://foragercycles.com/collections/all/products/jemmy-bar\">Jemmy Bar</a>,” Aussie slang for a crowbar.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?w=1999&amp;quality=75 1999w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The handlebars arrived and included a shim for adapting a 22.2 bar to a 31.8 stem. Once the Jemmy Bar was in place, I immediately gained confidence and had control of where I was going; the Stumpjumper became an actual mountain bike and, when going to the trails, I found myself spinning up very steep pitches and lacing tight turns that I wouldn’t have dared attempting on my drop bar plus-bike. My hands appreciated the angles and flexibility, and the bike felt and looked so complete.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1866\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-33.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-33.jpg?w=1866&amp;quality=75 1866w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-33.jpg?resize=1024,732&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-33.jpg?resize=768,549&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-33.jpg?resize=1800,1286&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-33.jpg?resize=1335,954&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-33.jpg?resize=700,500&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-33.jpg?resize=1536,1097&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1866\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-20.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-20.jpg?w=1866&amp;quality=75 1866w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-20.jpg?resize=1024,732&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-20.jpg?resize=768,549&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-20.jpg?resize=1800,1286&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-20.jpg?resize=1335,954&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-20.jpg?resize=700,500&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-1-20.jpg?resize=1536,1097&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>After a year of living on the Stumpjumper I’ve recently transferred the bars over to my rigid bikepacking bike because, as much as I love the wide drops, my summer riding plans suggested I might be better off with a flat bar. At this very moment, I am part of the scouting team for the new <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ruta-del-jefe-cycling-event-migrates-to-cuenca-los-ojos/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruta del Jefe</a> route, and our recon missions to date have revealed a lot to recommend a flat bar: rugged, overgrown rocky roads, river crossings, sand patches, and steep climbs and descents. When we came for the first scouting I had drop bars and feared for my life a few times, but now I can stop and steer more confidently while also staying comfortable for the four or five hours that our daily rides span. On flat and long sections, I’ve tried putting my hands on the innermost part of the bar for a different—and narrower—position, so I might throw some bar tape on the exposed sections beside the stem.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04063.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04063.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04063.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04063.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04063.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04063.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04063.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04063.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03786.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03786.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03786.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03786.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03786.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03786.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03786.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03786.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The center of the Jemmy fortunately gets along very well with a handlebar bag (Big and small Fabio’s chest tested!), and I find that the forward sweep actually gives the cables a little extra room to run behind the bag. I’ve run two stem bags and a bike computer with cockpit room to spare. I’ve also spent some time riding a Jones bar and while there were aspects that I enjoyed, overall I found the backsweep angle to be a bit too severe; the Jemmy seems to hit the amount of backsweep just right. For another comparison, on the scouting trip where I snapped these photos, Sarah Swallow was running Tumbleweed’s Persuader bar which seems to have a very similar backsweep angle to the Jemmy but the Persuader definitely had more noticeable rise.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03118.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03118.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03118.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03118.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03118.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03118.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03118.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC03118.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?w=1999&amp;quality=75 1999w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Copy-of-DSC04023.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>After these weeks of riding singletrack and rugged dirt roads with newfound confidence, I think the Jemmy will be a permanent fixture on my bikepacking bike for the foreseeable future.
