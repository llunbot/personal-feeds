{"title":"Senator Ron Wyden: Governments Are Spying on Apple and Google Users Through Push Notifications","link":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/governments-spying-apple-google-users-through-push-notifications-us-senator-2023-12-06/","date":1701896338000,"content":"\n<p>Raphael Satter, reporting for Reuters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unidentified governments are surveilling smartphone users via \ntheir apps’ push notifications, a U.S. senator warned on \nWednesday. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24191267-wyden_smartphone_push_notification_surveillance_letter_to_doj_-_signed\">In a letter to the Department of Justice</a>, \nSenator Ron Wyden said foreign officials were demanding the data \nfrom Alphabet’s Google and Apple. Although details were sparse, \nthe letter lays out yet another path by which governments can \ntrack smartphones. [...] </p>\n\n<p>In a statement, Apple said that Wyden’s letter gave them the \nopening they needed to share more details with the public about \nhow governments monitored push notifications. “In this case, the \nfederal government prohibited us from sharing any information,” \nthe company said in a statement. “Now that this method has become \npublic we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these \nkinds of requests.” </p>\n\n<p>Google said that it shared Wyden’s “commitment to keeping users \ninformed about these requests.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24191267-wyden_smartphone_push_notification_surveillance_letter_to_doj_-_signed\">Wyden’s letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple and Google should be permitted to be transparent about the \nlegal demands they receive, particularly from foreign governments, \njust as the companies regularly notify users about other types of \ngovernment demands for data. These companies should be permitted \nto generally reveal whether they have been compelled to facilitate \nthis surveillance practice, to publish aggregate statistics about \nthe number of demands they receive, and unless temporarily gagged \nby a court, to notify specific customers about demands for their \ndata. I would ask that the DOJ repeal or modify any policies that \nimpede this transparency. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/06/wyden-apple-google-push-notifications\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"56f128bc14a5e900ff9c96fc42f4a94d122006fbc17fe89c57b5c1327f945c6c","category":"Tech"}
