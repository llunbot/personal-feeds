Currently, <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/businesses/plug-in-electric-vehicle-credit-irc-30-and-irc-30d\">tax payers are eligible for a tax credit</a> of up to $7,500 based on the size of the vehicle's battery for the first 200,000 plug-in vehicles from a given automaker. But Republican Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska introduced a non-binding amendment to the $3.5 trillion budget bill that would means-test this tax credit, restricting it to tax payers with incomes below $100,000.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more significantly, Sen. Fischer's amendment also restricts the tax credit to EVs that cost less than $40,000. Consequently, the only battery EVs that will still be eligible for the tax credit will be the Hyundai Ioniq Electric ($34,250), <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/10/the-new-2019-hyundai-kona-ev-is-a-clever-little-electric-crossover/\">Hyundai Kona EV ($38,565)</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/05/the-electric-2020-mini-cooper-se-big-driving-fun-little-driving-range/\">Mini Cooper SE ($30,750)</a>, and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/07/nissans-bigger-battery-bev-the-2019-leaf-plus-review/\">Nissan Leaf S Plus ($39,220)</a>. Chevrolet's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/chevrolet-gives-the-bolt-ev-a-facelift-a-stretch-and-a-price-cut/\">Bolt EV and Bolt EUV</a> are both below the price threshold, but <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/01/gm-sold-200000-electric-vehicles-by-q4-2018-reuters-source-says/\">in 2019 the automaker sold its 200,000th plug-in vehicle</a>, at which point the tax credit began to phase out.</p>\n<p>The amendment passed, 51-48. Senator Fischer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorFischer/status/1425263526281719810\">took to Twitter to say that</a> \"everyday Americans are living paycheck to paycheck because of the sharp rise in costs due to #Bideninflation.
