Literally, it sticks out from your steerer to support those bags so they’re not dangling and flopping from your handlebar.</p><p>Made with stainless steel and powder coated black, the Twisted rack uses an bent support tube leading into a T-shape to give that bar bag a perch upon which to rest.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184328/twisted-rack-steerer-tube-handlebar-bag-support-7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184328/twisted-rack-steerer-tube-handlebar-bag-support-7.jpg\" alt=\"twisted rack front bicycle handlebar bag rack\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1049\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184328/twisted-rack-steerer-tube-handlebar-bag-support-7.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184328/twisted-rack-steerer-tube-handlebar-bag-support-7-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184328/twisted-rack-steerer-tube-handlebar-bag-support-7-800x599.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184328/twisted-rack-steerer-tube-handlebar-bag-support-7-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184328/twisted-rack-steerer-tube-handlebar-bag-support-7-768x575.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>Available in three lengths to work with stems from 30-50mm, 60-80mm, and 90-110mm, they also come in two versions for either metal or carbon steerer tubes.</p><p>The standard version ($65) uses a solid steerer spacer with no clamp, just slide it over any alloy or steel steerer tube, then put your stem over it and clamp it down.</p><p>The clamp version ($75) is for carbon fiber steerer tubes. They found that it was better to have it clamped firmly (but not over tightened!) to the carbon steerer so that it couldn’t rotate, which could score and scrape the tube, eventually potentially wearing it down.</p><p>You’ll want about 15mm of spacer height to be safe, but it can rest directly against the headset top and/or bottom of the stem. And, obviously, you’ll need a straight or riser stem.

The Pierogi Bar Bag ($58) is sized for a phone, snacks, and wallet, plus maybe a charging cable or small battery pack. The front is a lightweight, waterproof XPAC material, and the sides and back are a more durable, abrasion resistant version of it.

Also playing along with the miniature bag them is their tiny (standard, really, for the category) Lil’ Chumpy saddle bag ($24) and a mini, snack-sized handlebar roll that’s not on their site yet. We like the idea of the small front bag because it’s unlikely to flop back and forth, but still gives us a bit more storage.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184317/REload-bags-larg-saddlebag-and-hip-pack.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184317/REload-bags-larg-saddlebag-and-hip-pack.jpg\" alt=\"oversized saddle bag and hip pack from reload bags\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184317/REload-bags-larg-saddlebag-and-hip-pack.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184317/REload-bags-larg-saddlebag-and-hip-pack-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184317/REload-bags-larg-saddlebag-and-hip-pack-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184317/REload-bags-larg-saddlebag-and-hip-pack-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184317/REload-bags-larg-saddlebag-and-hip-pack-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184317/REload-bags-larg-saddlebag-and-hip-pack-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The larger Kitchen Sink saddle bag ($65) provides more storage and measures about 7″ x 7″ x 6″ when fully stuffed. It’s shown here with a rubber strap, but production models come with a standard buckle and clip strap that cinches tight to secure it to your post.</p><p>In the background on Ro’s waist is their BRAAP Pack, a larger hip pack with MOLLE loops on the back for attaching more stuff. It has a 2″ wide belt with adjustment straps to pull the pack snug around the corners for a secure fit when shredding trail. It’s $75 and, like all of their bags, comes in a wide array of colors using whatever’s on hand in their shop at the moment, or as a full custom in whatever colors you want. It, and the saddle bags, are made with 1000D Cordura outer fabric with a waterproof liner inside.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184323/REload-bags-minimalist-mountain-bike-hip-pack.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184323/REload-bags-minimalist-mountain-bike-hip-pack.jpg\" alt=\"minimalist hip pack for mountain bikers from reload bags\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184323/REload-bags-minimalist-mountain-bike-hip-pack.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184323/REload-bags-minimalist-mountain-bike-hip-pack-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184323/REload-bags-minimalist-mountain-bike-hip-pack-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184323/REload-bags-minimalist-mountain-bike-hip-pack-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184323/REload-bags-minimalist-mountain-bike-hip-pack-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184323/REload-bags-minimalist-mountain-bike-hip-pack-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The WRAAP pack ($75) is a pared down, minimalist hip pack that holds the essentials in clever ways. You’ll want to put the hydration on your bike, but this one threads a spare tube under the pockets to provide cushioning against your back. Slotted pockets hold gels and such, while a main central pocket has a Velcro flap cover to secure the important stuff like tools and CO2. Straps hold your pump on the outside.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184315/REload-bags-front-bicycle-basket-grocery-bag.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184315/REload-bags-front-bicycle-basket-grocery-bag.jpg\" alt=\"bicycle basket grocery bag from reload bags\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184315/REload-bags-front-bicycle-basket-grocery-bag.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184315/REload-bags-front-bicycle-basket-grocery-bag-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184315/REload-bags-front-bicycle-basket-grocery-bag-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184315/REload-bags-front-bicycle-basket-grocery-bag-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/08184315/REload-bags-front-bicycle-basket-grocery-bag-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>The Deluxe Waldo basket bag ($129) has a roll top closure with clip straps to secure it inside your basket, plus a front Velcro flap pocket.
