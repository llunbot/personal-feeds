It is unclear if Apple will revisit resin-coated copper for iPhone 18 models or later, but it appears that the material is at least a few years away from being used in iPhones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nResin-coated copper is a thin layer of copper foil coated with a resin, such as an epoxy. The material would allow for a thinner logic board, which in turn would provide more internal space for other components and sensors in future iPhones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt was also rumored that at least one new Apple Watch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/next-apple-watch-thinner-logic-board-rumor/\">would use resin-coated copper</a> this year, but it is unclear if that plan has been delayed too.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/17/kuo-iphone-17-wont-use-resin-coated-copper/\">Kuo: Apple Delays Change Aimed at Saving Space Inside Future iPhones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-delays-change-aimed-at-saving-space-inside-future-iphones.2431588/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6fbf562ce685a074103724a49ed66a9dc7adb32fec60d06a7abe39e501f0be31","category":"Apple"}
