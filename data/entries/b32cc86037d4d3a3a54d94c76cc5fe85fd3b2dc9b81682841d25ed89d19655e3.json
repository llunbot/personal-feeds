First, you\ncould backup/sync an unlimited amount of data (for a limited\ntime). There was no need to worry about upgrading your account\ntemporarily or having photo storage crowd out storage for other\napps. Second, you could access recent photos and videos on all\ndevices without having to store <em>everything</em> in the cloud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/30/icloud-photo-stream\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b32cc86037d4d3a3a54d94c76cc5fe85fd3b2dc9b81682841d25ed89d19655e3","category":"Tech"}
