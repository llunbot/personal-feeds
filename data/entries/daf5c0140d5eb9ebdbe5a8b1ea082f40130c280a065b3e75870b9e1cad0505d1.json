It comes with a 37mm deep aero profile and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-rim-width\" target=\"_blank\">21mm internal, 27mm external rim width</a> and has a claimed weight of 1,240g for the 2-Way Fit <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-fit-tubeless-tyres\">tubeless-compatible</a> clincher rim, which can also be run with tubes; go for the tubular rim and the claimed weight drops to just 1,160g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While previous Hyperons were ultra-low-profile wheels with a classic climber’s aesthetic, Campag now favours a 37mm rim depth that it says optimises reactivity and agility for fast climbs and quick manoeuvring. The brand says: ‘We have really pushed the boundaries with Hyperon Ultra, creating “the magic ratio of performance”. These wheels are built with pure agility and performance in mind, balancing across all elements: lightness, handling and reactivity.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo has confirmed that the wheels have been tested in the wind tunnel, but cannot share any data about the wheels’ performance at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2-Way Fit clincher version of the wheels are priced at £3,200 / $4,099.95 / €3,650 and are available now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tubeless-ready rims</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"649\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-1-970x649.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-1-970x649.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-1-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-1-768x514.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-1-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-1-750x502.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-1-1140x763.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-1.jpg 1613w\" /><figcaption>Campagnolo</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Hyperon Ultra wheelset is hand built from ‘aerospace-grade’ carbon fibre and proprietary resin, with a layup which Campagnolo says increases stiffness and resistance. The design means that the carbon fibres aren’t punched through for the spoke holes, but wrap around them, with fibreglass reinforcement for the nipple seats and the alloy nipples themselves fully enclosed within the rim. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-bora-ultra-wto\">Campagnolo Bora Ultra WTO 60 wheelset review</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/campagnolo-n3w-compatible-wheels\">Buyer’s guide to Campagnolo N3W wheels: Which brands are Ekar-compatible?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/which-is-faster-aero-vs-lightweight-wheels\">Which is faster: Aero vs lightweight wheels</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-ceramic-bearings-worth-it\">Are ceramic bearings worth it?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>The rear rim profile is asymmetric and both rims have a fully-sealed rim bed that doesn’t need taping, saving yet more weight. If a spoke does need to be replaced, this means that the nipple has to be moved into position using Campagnolo’s MoMag system which uses a magnet to manipulate it within the rim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rims have a high-gloss, ‘C-Lux’ finish that Campagnolo says saves weight by not requiring lacquering. Instead, it’s a natural result of the fabrication methods Campagnolo uses and the rim apparently comes out of the mould fully-finished. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the wheels’ light weight, the rims are still hooked rather than hookless, as the brand believes a hooked rim is still the best way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We want riders to be safe in any situation, so we continue with hooked rims,’ says the brand. ‘We can manufacture the hooks to such precise tolerances and shape that we can negate the risk of tyre blowoff but also avoid the light bulb effect that hooked rims often force the tyre to adopt.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ceramic hub bearings</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-4-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-4-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-4.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Campagnolo</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The hubs use Campagnolo’s CULT <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-ceramic-bearings-worth-it\">ceramic bearings</a>, which run in wear-resistant stainless steel races. They use the brand’s Head-2-Bay tech, which seats a forward and rearward-facing spoke pair in each flange drilling which, Campagnolo says, ensures optimal spoke tension and power transfer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Campagnolo, the wheels’ Head-2-Bay feature makes use of a metal cup that helps the head of the spoke sit perfectly in the hubshell. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It prevents tension-induced spoke breaks,’ says the brand.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-5-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-5-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Campagnolo-Hyperon-Ultra-5.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Campagnolo</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The wheels are laced 2:1 with 21 steel bladed spokes at the front, radial on the non-brake side and two-crossed on the left, with the hub flange higher on the left than the right.
