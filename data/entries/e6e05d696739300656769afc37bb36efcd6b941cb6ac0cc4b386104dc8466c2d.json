The regular\nversions of Pepsi and Dr Pepper are neck and neck in a spot that\nPepsi has held nearly every year for the past four decades,\naccording to sales-volume data from Beverage Digest.</p>\n\n<p>Dr Pepper’s new ranking follows a steady climb over the past 20\nyears. Its ascent is a product of big marketing investments, novel\nflavors and a quirk in Dr Pepper’s distribution that has put it on\nmore soda fountains than any other soft drink in the U.S. At the\nsame time, consumption of regular Pepsi has fallen as its drinkers\nswitch to Pepsi Zero Sugar or migrate to other drinks.</p>\n\n<p>The overall Pepsi brand, including Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Zero\nSugar, remains the No. 2 soda trademark in the U.S., though its\nmarket share has been slipping. Coke is the largest, with more\nthan twice the market share by volume of any of its rivals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I seldom drink sugared soda anymore, but when I do, it’s almost always either a Coke or a Dr Pepper, both of which I’ve enjoyed since childhood. (If you’re at a place that lets you pour your own fountain drinks, trying mixing Coke and Dr Pepper half-and-half — delicious.) And I’ve always despised both the taste and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/16/samsung-uncrush\">branding</a> of Pepsi. Dr Pepper, on the other hand, has long handled its status as the upstart <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPqfPcISzRY\">in a fun way</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://jabberwocking.com/dr-pepper-is-now-2/\">Via Kevin Drum</a>, who, like me, is surprised that the no-sugar variants of these brands aren’t more popular.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, from the DF archive back in 2003: “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2003/10/pop_culture\">Pop Culture</a>”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/03/dr-pepper\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e6e05d696739300656769afc37bb36efcd6b941cb6ac0cc4b386104dc8466c2d","category":"Tech"}
