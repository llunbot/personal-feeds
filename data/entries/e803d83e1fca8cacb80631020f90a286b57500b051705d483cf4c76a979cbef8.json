{"title":"Framous 1.0","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/25/framous-mac-app-device-screenshots/","date":1741054194000,"content":"\n<p>Chance Miller, writing last week at 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise-ambient-sounds/id1465439395\">Dark Noise</a> developer Charlie Chapman is out with a new Mac\nutility <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id6636520519\">called “Framous.”</a> The app aims to be the best way\nto add device frames to screenshots. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Here are the ways Framous aims to streamline this process:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Auto-detect your device based on your screenshot to pick the\nright frame from a growing library of devices</li>\n<li>Combine multiple devices into a single image, or bulk export\nmultiple separate images at once</li>\n<li>Quick customization options to change frame colors and more</li>\n<li>Automate your screenshot framing with Shortcuts support for even\nmore efficient workflows</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are a bunch of ways you can add device frames to screenshots like this, but none as clever, fast, and easy as <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/framous-screenshot-frames/id6636520519?mt=12\">Framous</a>. I love it. So many little details. You can just drop a screenshot in and copy a framed version out with zero fuss, but there are also all sorts of tweaks and adjustments you can make, right down to choosing which shade of titanium to color your specific iPhone Pro model. Chapman has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N24sAXuB_DY\">a great 20-minute walkthrough video</a> showing all of Framous’s features, and he posted <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@charliemchapman/114065382722677009\">a bunch of shorter videos</a> showcasing specific features to Mastodon. I was sold after watching just one of these.</p>\n\n<p>Framous is completely free to use with nice-looking generic device frames, and a $20 one-time purchase to unlock the exquisitely-detailed “real” frames covering all devices through the end of 2025. Or, a $10/year subscription to keep up to date with future device frames. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/framous-screenshot-frames/id6636520519?mt=12\">Available at the Mac App Store</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/03/framous\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e803d83e1fca8cacb80631020f90a286b57500b051705d483cf4c76a979cbef8","category":"Tech"}
