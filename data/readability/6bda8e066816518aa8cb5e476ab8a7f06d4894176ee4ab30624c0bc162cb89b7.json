Usually, build options revolve around small details that relate to performance, weight, and comfort, like drivetrains, wheel sets, and accessories.</p><p>Envo’s Flex bikes are definitely not that.</p><p>Here’s how it works. Envo Flex bikes start with the same base dual battery-powered frame. From there, riders can select one of four options to build up around the bike to tailor it to different types of riding.</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UR5gaI1JTzI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p>The styles include the aforementioned Snowbike. This bike is a beast of a machine that features a pedal-assisted rear track and a suspension fork out front mounted onto a ski.</p><p>The second is a trike that includes a generous amount of storage in the rear, not to mention the stability of three wheels for riders who may feel less comfortable leaning and dipping into turns.</p><p>The final two options include the Overland and Urban models.</p><div id=\"attachment_280048\"><p><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-280048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/03213747/Envo-Flex-Overland.jpg\" alt=\"Envo Flex Overland e-bike.
