{"title":"The Wilde Rambler SL Gravel Bike Defines Why I Prefer to Ride Metal","link":"https://bikerumor.com/wilde-rambler-sl-gravel-bike-review/","date":1748439150000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-hero.webp\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" alt=\"(Photos / Ron Frazelle)\" /></p>\n<p>I love the ride of a well-made, lightweight steel frame. I always have. It’s what I’ve always ridden and what I still default to time and time again. Don’t get me wrong, I know there are some real benefits to riding a carbon frame. But, for the most part, I prefer to ride steel. That being said, my Wilde Rambler SL (Super Light) frame set is one of the best riding steel bikes I’ve ridden in a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-post-rain-ride.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-post-rain-ride.webp\" alt=\"Review Wilde Rambler SL Gravel Bike post rain ride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-post-rain-ride.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-post-rain-ride-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-post-rain-ride-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-post-rain-ride-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>After a rainy ride…(Photos / Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rambler SL frameset comes with a color-matched, carbon fork and is built using proprietary Wilde TLC tubing. The TLC stands for Tough, Light, and Compliant. The tubing diameters, wall thickness, and butting profiles are chosen based on each model and frame size. The result is a steel frame that Wilde says is “built to last, light as practical, and exceedingly comfortable”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilde Bicycles also offers the Rambler with a steel fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Rambler SL Build</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-on-the-bench-e1748387265104.webp\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-on-the-bench-e1748387265104.webp\" alt=\"Review Wilde Rambler SL Gravel Bike on the bench\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-on-the-bench-e1748387265104.webp 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-on-the-bench-e1748387265104-297x278.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-on-the-bench-e1748387265104-120x113.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-on-the-bench-e1748387265104-768x720.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me start by telling you that I’ve been longing for a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wilde-rambler-sl-affordable-all-purpose-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Wilde Rambler SL since I wrote the PR piece about it</a> a little over two years ago. This last January, I was finally able to acquire one. I chose the XL in the Copper Metallic color. It’s a beautiful color.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also appreciate the frame’s aesthetics. I’m just a sucker for skinny frame tubes and understated graphics. And this frameset ticks both of those boxes. When I was building the frame into a bike, I wanted to keep the build simple and elegant.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-almost-done.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-almost-done.webp\" alt=\"Review Wilde Rambler SL Gravel Bike almost done\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-almost-done.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-almost-done-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-almost-done-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-almost-done-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Almost done.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-cranks.webp\"><img width=\"1246\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-cranks.webp\" alt=\"Review Wilde Rambler SL Gravel Bike cranks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-cranks.webp 1246w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-cranks-292x300.webp 292w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-cranks-117x120.webp 117w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-cranks-768x789.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>White Industries R30 cranks</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the components I used to build the Rambler SL were taken from my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/masi-incanto-ti-allroad-gravel-dream-build/\" target=\"_blank\">Masi Incanto</a>.

It is such a nice touch, and really adds to the elegant look of the bike. Lastly, the color. The Copper Metallic is gorgeous and pops in the sun. Wilde took the time to wet paint the frame and fork, and it looks amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my opinion, that kind of attention to detail matters. And Wilde’s owner, Jeff Frane, is no stranger to honing in on the details. I mean, just take a look at the details on last year’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/made-show-best-of-show-wilde-bikes-sugar-foot/\" target=\"_blank\">Best of Show award winner</a>, at the MADE Show.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Rambler SL Ride</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-trail-side.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-trail-side.webp\" alt=\"Review Wilde Rambler SL Gravel Bike trail side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-trail-side.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-trail-side-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-trail-side-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-trail-side-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff is also some sort of geometry wizard. He knows what he’s doing when it comes to frame geometry, and the geo on my Rambler SL feels totally dialed. It’s one of the better-fitting bikes I’ve ridden. The same could be said for the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/updated-wilde-bikes-supertramp-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Wilde Supertramp I just reviewed </a>as well. So, dialed geometry seems to be a thing over there at Wilde.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wilde Rambler SL Geo</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2.png\"><img width=\"768\" height=\"423\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2-297x164.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2-120x66.png 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the above numbers indicate a bike that is ready to tackle everything. I’ve done quick rainy road rides, short techy dirt loops, favorite single track, bombed long paved descents, and roamed many gravel roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-oot-and-aboot.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-oot-and-aboot.webp\" alt=\"Review Wilde Rambler SL Gravel Bike oot and aboot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-oot-and-aboot.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-oot-and-aboot-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-oot-and-aboot-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-oot-and-aboot-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what the ride, in the last 500 or so miles that I’ve ridden my Rambler SL, I never once felt like I was on the wrong bike. It’s light, and it rides and pedals very fast. I love every minute of my rides on the Rambler SL. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-long-beach.webp\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-long-beach.webp\" alt=\"Review Wilde Rambler SL Gravel Bike long beach\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-long-beach.webp 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-long-beach-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-long-beach-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-long-beach-768x1024.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-giant-penny.webp\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-giant-penny.webp\" alt=\"Review Wilde Rambler SL Gravel Bike giant penny\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-giant-penny.webp 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-giant-penny-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-giant-penny-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-giant-penny-768x1024.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rambler SL’s carbon fork is perfectly balanced to be both predictable, stiff, and compliant. Combined with the Hunt carbon wheels and the butted steel frame, the bike rides exceptionally smooth and stable.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-Chino-Hills.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-Chino-Hills.webp\" alt=\"Review Wilde Rambler SL Gravel Bike Chino Hills\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-Chino-Hills.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-Chino-Hills-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-Chino-Hills-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-Chino-Hills-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I ended up swapping the Tumbleweed Big Dipper drop bar that I built the bike with, for one of my favorite bars, the Velo Orange Nouveau Randonneur drop bar. It’s a lighter bar that isn’t so overbuilt. Plus, I stepped down in width when I replaced the Tumbleweed bar, from a 51cm wide bar to a 46cm wide bar. In the future, I would like to try a set of carbon bars on this build.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line here is that this steel frame rides like a dream. Period. In my opinion, the frame is lightweight, durable, and versatile. It’s literally everything I look for in a bicycle. The Rambler SL rides like a much more expensive, custom-built steel frame. And at $1500, the Wilde Rambler SL frameset is reasonable and affordable. I would have zero issues recommending this beauty of a frame to anyone. I’ll be riding mine for many, many years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-gravel.webp\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-gravel.webp\" alt=\"Review Wilde Rambler SL Gravel Bike gravel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-gravel.webp 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-gravel-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-gravel-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Review-Wilde-Rambler-SL-Gravel-Bike-gravel-768x1024.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t think of anything I would change on the frameset… I’m pretty much totally in love with it.
