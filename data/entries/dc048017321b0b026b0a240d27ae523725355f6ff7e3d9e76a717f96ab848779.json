{"title":"‘Triangulation’ — Complex Exploit Backdoored Unknown Number of iPhones Over 4 Years","link":"https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/12/exploit-used-in-mass-iphone-infection-campaign-targeted-secret-hardware-feature/","date":1703724485000,"content":"\n<p>Dan Goodin, reporting for Ars Technica:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Researchers on Wednesday presented intriguing new findings \nsurrounding an attack that over four years backdoored dozens if \nnot thousands of iPhones, many of which belonged to employees of \nMoscow-based security firm Kaspersky. Chief among the discoveries: \nthe unknown attackers were able to achieve an unprecedented level \nof access by exploiting a vulnerability in an undocumented \nhardware feature that few if anyone outside of Apple and chip \nsuppliers such as ARM Holdings knew of. </p>\n\n<p>“The exploit’s sophistication and the feature’s obscurity suggest \nthe attackers had advanced technical capabilities,” Kaspersky \nresearcher Boris Larin wrote in an email. “Our analysis hasn’t \nrevealed how they became aware of this feature, but we’re \nexploring all possibilities, including accidental disclosure in \npast firmware or source code releases. They may also have stumbled \nupon it through hardware reverse engineering.” [...] </p>\n\n<p>The mass backdooring campaign, which according to Russian \nofficials also infected the iPhones of thousands of people \nworking inside diplomatic missions and embassies in Russia, \naccording to Russian government officials, came to light in June. \nOver a span of at least four years, Kaspersky said, the \ninfections were delivered in iMessage texts that installed \nmalware through a complex exploit chain without requiring the \nreceiver to take any action. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://securelist.com/operation-triangulation-the-last-hardware-mystery/111669/\">the report by the Kaspersky researchers</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If we try to describe this feature and how the attackers took \nadvantage of it, it all comes down to this: they are able to write \ndata to a certain physical address while bypassing the \nhardware-based memory protection by writing the data, destination \naddress, and data hash to unknown hardware registers of the chip \nunused by the firmware. </p>\n\n<p>Our guess is that this unknown hardware feature was most likely \nintended to be used for debugging or testing purposes by Apple \nengineers or the factory, or that it was included by mistake. \nBecause this feature is not used by the firmware, we have no idea \nhow attackers would know how to use it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/27/triangulation-exploit\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dc048017321b0b026b0a240d27ae523725355f6ff7e3d9e76a717f96ab848779","category":"Tech"}
