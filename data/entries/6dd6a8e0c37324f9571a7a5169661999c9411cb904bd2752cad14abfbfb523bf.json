What volume of photos, hardware specifications, and other details constitutes a leak, rather than a quick-draining colander?</p>\n<p>Google's Pixel 9 series of phones are expected to be launched at an event on August 13. Because those phones need to be certified by various regulators, including the <a href=\"https://www.ncc.gov.tw/english/\">Taiwanese National Communications Commission</a>, or NCC, there are now photos—so many photos—of all four phones Google is expected to announce next month. The Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Google's second attempt at a folding phone, have been sized, measured, rated for battery life and charging speed, and even disassembled for a look inside.</p>\n<p>As has been suggested by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/googles-pixel-9-gets-its-first-leaked-render-looks-a-lot-like-an-iphone/\">Pixel 9 renders</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-pixel-9-might-have-three-models-adding-a-small-pro-phone/\">renders of all three non-folding phones</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/first-real-life-pixel-9-pro-pictures-leak-and-it-has-16gb-of-ram/\">pictures of prototypes</a>, the NCC pictures confirm that Google's \"Pro\" phone in this series is the same size as the standard model 9 but with three rear cameras and upgraded, possibly AI-friendly specs. The NCC filings don't confirm all internal specs, such as the eye-popping 16GB of RAM seen in an earlier Pixel 9 Pro prototype. Google has previously noted that keeping certain generative models to be \"RAM-resident\" requires more RAM.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037418#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037418&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6dd6a8e0c37324f9571a7a5169661999c9411cb904bd2752cad14abfbfb523bf","category":"Tech"}
