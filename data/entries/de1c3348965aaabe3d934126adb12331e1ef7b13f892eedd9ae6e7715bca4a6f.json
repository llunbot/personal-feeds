The charge can apply to goods manufactured and sold in different states and the facilities that house them—like the Tesla showroom or the Republican office, which also sells MAGA merchandise. DOJ spokesperson Shannon Shevlin tells WIRED that Wagner’s arrest happened on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“Let this be the final lesson to those taking part in this ongoing wave of political violence,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in the Monday press release. “We will arrest you, we will prosecute you, and we will not negotiate. Crimes have consequences.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/feds-charge-new-mexico-man-for-allegedly-torching-tesla-dealership/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/feds-charge-new-mexico-man-for-allegedly-torching-tesla-dealership/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Caroline Haskins, wired.com","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"de1c3348965aaabe3d934126adb12331e1ef7b13f892eedd9ae6e7715bca4a6f","category":"Tech"}
