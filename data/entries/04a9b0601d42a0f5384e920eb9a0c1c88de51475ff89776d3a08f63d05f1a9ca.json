For one, Apple posted what it called it’s “best quarter ever” with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4 percent year over year. However, the iPhone stumbled a bit as sales in China took a tumble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iPhone sales were down slightly to just over $69 billion and came in under estimates of $71 billion. CEO Tim Cook blamed some of the lower sales on the lack of Apple Intelligence in China, which suffered an 11 percent overall sales decline. Cook said a change in channel inventory was also partially to blame for the sales drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest performers were the Mac, which posted a whopping 15 percent increase, and Services, which again grew to an all-time high of $26.3 billion in sales. Apple released new M4 Macs in the quarter, including a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2512911/m4-pro-mac-mini-review-remarkably-small-and-incredibly-powerful.html\">redesigned Mac mini</a> and refreshed <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2510333/14-inch-m4-macbook-pro-review.html\">MacBook Pros</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iPad sales were also up, with more than $8 billion in sales for the first time Q1 2023. Apple released a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2504744/ipad-mini-a17-pro-review.html\">iPad mini</a> in October and many Apple tablets were heavily discounted over the Black Friday and holiday shopping periods. Apple is rumored to be releasing a new entry-level iPad in the spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wearables category, which includes AirPods, Apple Watch, and HomePod, was mostly flat despite the launch of a new Apple Watch in September. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cook noted that Apple’s installed base of active devices reached a new all-time high.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"04a9b0601d42a0f5384e920eb9a0c1c88de51475ff89776d3a08f63d05f1a9ca","category":"Apple"}
