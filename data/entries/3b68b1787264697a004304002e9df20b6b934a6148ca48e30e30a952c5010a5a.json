Error messages—including \"Message not sent,\" \"Something went wrong,\" and profiles tagged as \"considered malware\" or \"potentially harmful\"—give no direct suggestion of a block. But posts on X, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/613997/x-blocks-signal-me-links-errors\">reporting at The Verge</a>, and other sources suggest that Signal.me links are broadly banned.</p>\n<p>Signal.me links that were already posted on X prior to the recent change now show a \"Warning: this link may be unsafe\" interstitial page rather than opening the link directly. Links to Signal handles and <a href=\"https://signal.org/\">the Signal homepage</a> are still functioning on X.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/x-is-reportedly-blocking-links-to-secure-signal-contact-pages/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/x-is-reportedly-blocking-links-to-secure-signal-contact-pages/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3b68b1787264697a004304002e9df20b6b934a6148ca48e30e30a952c5010a5a","category":"Tech"}
