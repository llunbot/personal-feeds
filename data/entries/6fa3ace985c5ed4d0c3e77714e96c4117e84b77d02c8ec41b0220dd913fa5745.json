It's an open-weights preview of two AI models that use a technique called image-to-video, and it can run locally on a machine with an Nvidia GPU.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, Stability AI made waves with the release of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/\">Stable Diffusion</a>, an \"open weights\" image synthesis model that kick started a wave of open image synthesis and inspired a large community of hobbyists that have built off the technology with their own custom fine-tunings. Now Stability wants to do the same with AI video synthesis, although the tech is still in its infancy.</p>\n<p>Right now, Stable Video Diffusion consists of two models: one that can produce image-to-video synthesis at 14 frames of length (called \"SVD\"), and another that generates 25 frames (called \"SVD-XT\"). They can operate at varying speeds from 3 to 30 frames per second, and they output short (typically 2-4 second-long) MP4 video clips at 576×1024 resolution.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986424#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986424&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6fa3ace985c5ed4d0c3e77714e96c4117e84b77d02c8ec41b0220dd913fa5745","category":"Tech"}
