{"title":"Roku Doesn’t Support IPv6 and It Might Be a Big Deal","link":"https://community.roku.com/t5/Features-settings-updates/It-s-2022-and-still-no-IPv6/m-p/854673/highlight/true#M35732","date":1678126647000,"content":"\n<p>“DingleBog3899” on the Roku community forum (emphasis added):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our tribal network started out IPv6, but soon learned we had to\nsomehow support IPv4 only traffic. It took almost 11 months in\norder to get a small amount of IPv4 addresses allocated for this\nuse. In fact there were only enough addresses to cover maybe 1% of\npopulation. So we were forced to create a very expensive\nproxy/translation server in order to support this traffic.</p>\n\n<p>We learned a very expensive lesson. 71% of the IPv4 traffic we\nwere supporting was from Roku devices. 9% coming from DishNetwork\n&amp; DirectTV satellite tuners, 11% from HomeSecurity cameras and\nsystems, and remaining 9% we replaced extremely outdated Point of\nSale (POS) equipment. So we cut Roku some slack three years ago by\nspending a little over $300k just to support their devices.</p>\n\n<p>First off I despise both Apple and that other evil empire (house\nof mouse) I want nothing to do with either of them. Now with that\nsaid I am one of four individuals that suggested and lobbied 15\nother tribal nations to offer a new AppleTV device in exchange for\nactive Roku devices. Other nations are facing the same dilemma.\nSpend an exorbitant amount of money to support a small amount of\nantiquated devices or replace the problem devices at fraction of\nthe cost.</p>\n\n<p>Now if Roku cannot be proactive at keeping up with connectivity\nstandards they are going to be wiped out by their own complacency.\nJudging by the growing number of offers to replace their devices\nfor free their competitors are already proactively exploiting that\ncomplacency. <em>When we approached Apple to see about a discount to\npurchase a large number of their devices, for the exchange, they\neagerly offered to supply their devices for free.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seems weird to say you despise a company that supplied a Native American tribe with a slew of free Apple TVs, but the fact that he’s not an Apple fan makes it all the more telling that they went with Apple TVs as their solution. I wonder what the deal is with Roku not supporting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6\">IPv6</a>? Is it just something they haven’t gotten to, or have they somehow engineered a tech stack that only works on IPv4?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/06/roku-apple-tv\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"67b67220303de71a27d7532ee26505dbc88a4153011c54e58d453a48c5d0ab4d","category":"Tech"}
