The whole point is\nthat no single person or company is in charge, right? Well,\nwelcome to the wild world of open-source governance. It’s a riot,\nmy friends. You’re going to hear me and Eugen say the phrase\n“benevolent dictator for life” in dead seriousness because that’s\nhow a lot of these projects are run.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, we also talk about money and structure. Mastodon\ndoesn’t make a lot of money, and Eugen is figuring out how to\nbuild a structure that scales past just a handful of people. This\ntiny and mostly volunteer labor of love might very well be the\nfuture of social networking and, if you believe the hype about\nActivityPub, might have some part in the future of the web. That’s\npretty exciting, even if things seem a little messy in the moment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Terrific interview. Mastodon is thriving and has a bright future, but the nature of social networks makes it so hard to predict what that future is.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/08/rochko-mastodon-decoder\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d6d49a38b55aaf3ae26f90e2a700f3f07d6d72730392af571adc8f449abff67d","category":"Tech"}
