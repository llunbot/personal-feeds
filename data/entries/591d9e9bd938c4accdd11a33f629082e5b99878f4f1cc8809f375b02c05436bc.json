E-cores don't matter much for games, but they can help when you're trying to run background tasks <em>behind</em> your game, and they can also provide a decent boost to heavily multithreaded CPU workloads like video encoding or CPU-based rendering.</p>\n<p>This is nominally a review of the Core i5-13400, which is a good CPU and (when considered together with the cost of a motherboard and RAM) one of the better bargains you'll find if you're building a PC right now. The problem is that Intel sells a <em>lot</em> of very similar 12th- and 13th-generation Core i5 chips, and the prices are constantly bouncing around in that $160–$250 band. The one you should usually get depends on what you're doing and which one happens to be the cheapest at the moment you're buying.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926817#p3\">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926817&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"591d9e9bd938c4accdd11a33f629082e5b99878f4f1cc8809f375b02c05436bc","category":"Tech"}
