As usual, this gave customers on more limited budgets the flexibility to pick between five main iterations (counting the Plus variants) with three different sizes and a mixed assortment of technical specifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while none of these iPhones are bad phones, it couldn’t be a worse possible time to get one of them—even as a gift. And, if you got one, you may want to take it back before the holiday return window closes. Because the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE 4</a> will be better than all of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nothing special</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone SE line has long been in need of an update due to its outdated design. While higher-end iPhones have long moved on and adopted more modern appearances, the SE continues to persist in a bygone era. That’s about to change in a few months. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Credible leaks have long indicated that the iPhone SE 4, which is due to arrive this spring, will finally retire the classic chassis in favor of a modern look that adopts something similar to the iPhone 14. So, in just a few months, we could be bidding the prehistoric 4.7-inch LCD with thick bezels and a physical Home button farewell—once and for all. The front side would instead adopt an edge-to-edge, 6.1-inch OLED panel with a notch. This would finally provide iPhone SE users with an immersive screen featuring a higher pixel resolution, true black levels, and sleeker bezels. It could also offer a 48MO rear camera and a TrueDepth front camera with Face ID—all lightyears better than the current SE you just got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus it’s still got a Lightning port, as does the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1073091/iphone-14-review.html\">iPhone 14</a>. So, waiting for an iPhone SE 4 would spare you from carrying around a dedicated Lightning cable—assuming your other gadgets charge via USB-C.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USB-C-port-on-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"USB C port on iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USB-C-port-on-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USB-C-port-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USB-C-port-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USB-C-port-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USB-C-port-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USB-C-port-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USB-C-port-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/USB-C-port-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The iPhone SE and iPhone 14 still have Lightning ports, which means you have to carry an additional cable.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Searching for Apple Intelligence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From afar, the iPhone 14 and 15 may look more advanced than even the upcoming SE 4. After all, they pack dual rear camera systems, and the 2023 models boast the futuristic Dynamic Island. Meanwhile, 2025’s budget release will likely miss out on both features. Despite that, a closer look at the budget phone’s rumored internals suggests it’ll outperform the aforementioned iPhones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the iPhone SE 4 will likely pack either the iPhone 16’s base A18 chipset or the iPhone 17 Pro, featuring 6 CPU cores, 5 GPU cores, 16 Neural Engine cores, and 8GB of RAM. This would enable it to run some of the demanding mobile games that exclusively run on newer devices. Beyond its snappier Safari, the iPhone SE 4 will most probably receive software updates for a longer period than the 14 and 15 models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More importantly, though, it would unlock the extensive Apple Intelligence suite that isn’t available on the iPhone 14 or 15. Apple Intelligence is going to be a centerpiece of the Apple ecosystem for years to come, so you’re going to want a phone that supports it. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Intelligence-on-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Intelligence on iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Intelligence-on-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Intelligence-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Intelligence-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Intelligence-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Intelligence-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Intelligence-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Intelligence-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Apple-Intelligence-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Apple Intelligence might not be important now, but it will be at the forefront of Apple’s ecosystem for years to come.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Flagship quality at a discount</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone SE 4 won’t have every feature you’re getting with your <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2247687/iphone-15-review.html\">iPhone 15</a> or even the 14. The most prominent absentee will potentially be the ultra-wide rear lens available on the iPhone 14, 14 Plus, 15, and 15 Plus. The iPhone SE 4 could similarly be limited to a single 6.1-inch option, while the flagships from 2022 and 2023 offer larger 6.7-inch Plus editions. Otherwise, the final notable omission would be the Dynamic Island cutout available on the iPhone 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these drawbacks, the iPhone SE 4 will still be a better budget pick. Sure, the Dynamic Island is nice to have, but you’ll still be able to access Live Activities via the Notification Center and Lock Screen. And, even though the camera and size limitations may irritate certain customers, the iPhone SE 4 will be leaps ahead of its predecessor.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Face-ID-on-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Face ID on iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Face-ID-on-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Face-ID-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Face-ID-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Face-ID-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Face-ID-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Face-ID-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Face-ID-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Face-ID-on-iPhone.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Face ID is coming at least the iPhone SE, making it more secure and convenient.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching from a 4.7-inch, thick-bezel LCD to a 6.1-inch, edge-to-edge OLED will substantially upgrade the iPhone SE 4’s video-watching and app-scrolling experience. Comparably, upgrading the ancient rear camera from 12MP to 48MP will unlock crisper shots and 2x zoom that don’t completely wreck the outputted photos’ resolution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone SE 4 will be the first iPhone to offer both a design that fits our modern times and a flagship processor that supports all of the relevant iOS features. And, for the first time, iPhone users will get to experience Apple Intelligence—likely for less than $500. It’s even possible Apple will discontinue the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus altogether since paying $100 more for a similar iPhone that lacks Apple Intelligence and USB-C isn’t the best deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone SE 4 is shaping up to be a real threat to midrange Android phones and Apple’s current lineup. Based on the leaks, Apple appears to have addressed all the current SE’s flaws and built a phone that’s perfect for any user on a budget. So if you just got one of Apple’s cheaper phones, go box it up and return it, because something better is coming soon.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ed135a9baff78a7a76cddfb468b678be91c936d31eab9aafe322ce992cdbf075","category":"Apple"}
