It was an amazing celebration of the small <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/made-show-announces-2024-dates-opens-registration/\" target=\"_blank\">independent bicycle frame maker</a> and the cottage industry and culture that supports it. During the show, I was gifted a little bespoke produce, the <a href=\"https://www.stinnerframeworks.com/products/stinner-x-made-photo-stick?_pos=1&amp;_sid=69e8c1aba&amp;_ss=r\" target=\"_blank\">Stinner x MADE Photo </a>Stick. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-apart-in-hand-e1712773706483.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"1216\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-apart-in-hand-e1712773706483.jpeg\" alt=\"Stinner x MADE Photo Stick apart in hand\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-apart-in-hand-e1712773706483.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-apart-in-hand-e1712773706483-297x282.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-apart-in-hand-e1712773706483-120x114.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-apart-in-hand-e1712773706483-768x730.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>.(Photo/Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been anticipated since the show and has finally made it into production and is now available for sale. It was made by <a href=\"https://www.stinnerframeworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Stinner Frame Works</a>, in collaboration with the MADE Show. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-phot-shoot.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-phot-shoot.jpeg\" alt=\"Stinner x MADE Photo Stick phot shoot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-phot-shoot.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-phot-shoot-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-phot-shoot-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-phot-shoot-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-phot-shoot-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-phot-shoot-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Stinner x MADE Photo Stick in action…(Photo/Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, it’s been a game changer in aiding me to be able to easily shoot “hero” shots of my bicycle. I take it with me on all of my rides. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Photo Stick is fabricated in Santa Barbara, California, and features a lightweight, packable design and the expert craftsmanship that you’ve come to know from the Stinner brand. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-use-for-photos.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"1234\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-use-for-photos.jpeg\" alt=\"Stinner x MADE Photo Stick use for photos\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-use-for-photos.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-use-for-photos-297x286.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-use-for-photos-120x116.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-use-for-photos-768x740.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>.(Photo/Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first run of Photo Sticks will be available in steel, with a limited run of titanium versions coming soon. The photo stick breaks down and is very packable allowing you to stash it on the bike, ensuring that the shots of your ride are fully dialed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How’s it Made?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-three-pieces-e1712773809684.jpeg\"><img width=\"1124\" height=\"1094\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-three-pieces-e1712773809684.jpeg\" alt=\"Stinner x MADE Photo Stick three pieces\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-three-pieces-e1712773809684.jpeg 1124w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-three-pieces-e1712773809684-297x289.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-three-pieces-e1712773809684-120x117.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-three-pieces-e1712773809684-768x748.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Stinner Frame Works X MADE)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Photo Stick consists of three pieces with welded bottle bosses for attachment. As mentioned above, it breaks down very easily and can be packed on the bike, in a waist pack, backpack, front bag, or in the bag with your photo gear. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-on-gravel.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-on-gravel.jpeg\" alt=\"Stinner x MADE Photo Stick on gravel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-on-gravel.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-on-gravel-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-on-gravel-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-on-gravel-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-on-gravel-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-on-gravel-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Stinner Frame Works X MADE)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just screw it together and place it on the non-drive side bottom bracket/crankarm. The Photo Stick is finished in-house and comes with rubberized ends for added grip. You can leave it in the frame, or edit it out for a full pro-level floating bike shot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a true collaborative spirit, the MADE team brought the concept to Stinner for fabrication and then teased the product at the MADE 2023 show. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stinner x MADE Photo Stick Features and Retail</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $59.99</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Collapsible and packable (Welded bottle bosses for the win!)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Made in the USA</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cerekote finish for durability on the Steel version (Ti Coming Soon!)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Raw blasted finish on the Titanium version – COMING SOON!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rubberized ends for added stability</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>MADE Bike Show Australia: Tickets Now on Sale!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Show dates are: June 28th-29th</strong>, <strong>2024</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are excited to announce that official registration is now open for the inaugural <a href=\"https://made.bike/made-australia/\" target=\"_blank\">MADE Australian show</a>.
