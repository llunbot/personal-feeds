At launch, Google's VP of Real Estate &amp; Workplace Services, David Radcliffe, <a href=\"https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/bay-view-campus-grand-opening/\">said the site</a> \"marks the first time we developed one of our own major campuses, and the process gave us the chance to rethink the very idea of an office.\" The result is a wild tent-like structure with a striking roofline made up of swooping square sections. Of course, it's all made of metal and glass, but the roof shape looks like squares of cloth held up by poles—each square section has high points on the four corners and sags down in the middle. The roof is covered in solar cells and collects rainwater while also letting in natural light, and Google calls it the \"Gradient Canopy.\"</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/unnamed.webp\"><img alt=\"We'll guess the roofline's multiple parabolic sections are great at scattering the Wi-Fi signal.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/unnamed-980x653.webp\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/unnamed.webp\">We'll guess the roofline's multiple parabolic sections are great at scattering the Wi-Fi signal.</a> (credit: Google)</p></div>\n<p>All those peaks and parabolic ceiling sections apparently aren't great for Wi-Fi propagation, with the Reuters report saying that the roof \"swallows broadband like the Bermuda Triangle.\" Googlers assigned to the building are making do with Ethernet cables, using phones as hotspots, or working outside, where the Wi-Fi is stronger. One anonymous employee told Reuters, \"You’d think the world’s leading Internet company would have worked this out.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009247#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009247&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aaa7f766fd289d86c2f86a42dd9d6078663c5e79ba1a45ec0973e5f2d72464f3","category":"Tech"}
