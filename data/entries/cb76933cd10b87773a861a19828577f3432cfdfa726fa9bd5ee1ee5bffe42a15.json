Yet, this area is a bastian for locals looking for lower-elevation riding in the frigid winter months and maintains a rich and diverse biome. Animals use the Caja for a habitat as high-end/luxury housing has expanded and golf courses installed in a water-parched landscape.</em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/nepa/doeea-2199-los-alamos-national-laboratory-electrical-power-capacity-upgrade-project\" target=\"_blank\">Energy.gov is currently seeking public comments</a> related to the destruction of habitat in favor of a power line installation from Los Alamos.</em></p>\n<p><em>This comment period was extended as it was illegally posted during the holidays. So, if you ride bikes in the Caja, or believe the sacred home of the Cochiti Pueblo should be protected, please comment.
