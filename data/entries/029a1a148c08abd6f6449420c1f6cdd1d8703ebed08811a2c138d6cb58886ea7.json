Ghost Ship, ramping up its publishing arm after the multi-year success of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/how-deep-rock-galactics-dwarf-miners-have-helped-me-survive-the-pandemic/\"><em>Deep Rock Galactic</em></a>, gave Funday Games license to graft its quirky dwarven corporate dystopia onto the auto-shooting likes of <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/\">Vampire Survivors</a>. </em></p>\n<p>I'm glad they had that beer, and even more glad they've offered up the resulting game for Early Access on Windows PC via Steam (and Steam Deck, and Linux via Proton). <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321470/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Survivor/\"><em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em></a> is my favorite of the genre I sometimes call \"strategic walking.\" I am, of course, biased by the flavor and familiarity with <em>Deep Rock</em> <em>Galactic </em>(<em>DRG</em>). But the elements of <em>DRG </em>Funday has put into <em>DRG: </em><em>Survivor</em> make for a fun, cohesive game, one that's easy to play in sessions and not be overwhelmed—mentally, at least. Bug-wise, you are absolutely going to get trampled.</p>\n<div><div></div><p>Launch trailer for <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em>. </p></div>\n<p>We <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-will-mine-hours-of-auto-shooting-joy-from-your-life/\">peeked at <em>Survivor</em> in June,</a> and it has gotten a lot of polish since then, along with entirely new character classes, biomes, and upgrade mechanics. The basic mechanics remain the same: You complete mission objectives and mine resources while an increasing horde of insectoids chases you, and your weapons automatically fire at them. Some weapons shoot in wide patterns, some blast up close, and others do things like home in on the creature with the most hit points. The big decisions you make are where do you move to pick up dropped experience points and angle your shooting, and what do you pick for your upgrades when they become available.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003379#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003379&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"029a1a148c08abd6f6449420c1f6cdd1d8703ebed08811a2c138d6cb58886ea7","category":"Tech"}
