If you are upgrading from an iPhone 15 Pro model, expect a bit heavier device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are equipped with 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays, respectively, which are larger than the 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.
