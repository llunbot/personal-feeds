The report includes data on the number of apps rejected during the year, the number of customer and developer accounts deactivated, info on how many apps were removed from the ‌App Store‌, and so on.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Desaturated.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nThere were 1,961,596 total apps on the ‌App Store‌ at the end of 2024, up nearly 100,000 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/2023-app-store-transparency-report/\">from last year</a>. The ‌App Store‌ sees 839,266,915 average weekly app downloads, and 813,110,348 average weekly visitors to the ‌App Store‌, with both metrics up compared to 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple reviewed 7.77 million app submissions, and rejected 1.93 million of those. Performance, legal, design, business, and safety were the top reasons for rejection, in that order.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOf the 1.93 million submissions that were rejected, 295,109 were approved after developers addressed the issue. Apple removed 82,509 apps from the ‌App Store‌ during the year, primarily in the Utilities and Games categories. Apps that were removed are broken down by the reason behind the action, with design issues and fraud at the top of the list.\r<br />\n<ol>\r<br />\n \t<li>Guideline 4.0 -- Design: 42,252</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>DPLA 3.2(f) -- Fraud: 38,315</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>DPLA 6.3 -- Intellectual Property Infringement: 425</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Guideline 4.3.0 -- Spam: 294</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>DPLA 4.8 -- Export Control: 285</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Guideline 4.1.0 -- Copycats: 128</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Guideline 5.6.0 -- Developer Code of Conduct: 99</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Guideline 5.0.0 -- General: 89</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Guideline 5.2.1 -- Intellectual Property -- General: 77</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Guideline 3.1.2 -- Subscriptions: 69</li>\r<br />\n</ol>\r<br />\nApple also pulled some apps due to government takedown demands. The majority of government takedown requests came from China, and Apple removed 1,307 apps at China's request. There were 171 apps removed at Russia's request, 79 from South Korea, 55 from Ukraine, and 50 from Jordan.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple received 26,224 appeals of app removals, with 6,978 from China and 3,571 from the United States. Only 78 apps in China and 71 apps in the United States were restored after going through Apple's appeal process.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere were 128,961,839 customer accounts terminated, and Apple says it prevented over $2 billion in fraud. Apple also terminated 146,747 developer accounts due to fraud and export control.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has shared ‌App Store‌ Transparency Reports since 2023, because it agreed to do so as part of a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/26/app-store-changes-developer-lawsuit-settlement/\">2021 class action lawsuit settlement</a> with developers. Apple promised to deliver meaningful statistics about the app review process, listing everything from number of apps rejected to info on search queries.
