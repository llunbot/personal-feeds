{"title":"Freebie: COVID-19 Icon Set (56 Icons, AI, EPS, SVG, PNG)","link":"https://smashingmagazine.com/2021/10/freebie-coronavirus-icon-set/","date":1633597200000,"content":"<p>In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists are tirelessly working on vaccines and medicine against COVID-19 in laboratories. In the meantime, the entire world is waiting for good news while people worldwide are hardly waiting to unite and return to a peaceful life. For now, we can still only observe the regime of social distance, self-isolation and wearing masks.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://graphicsurf.com/\">graphicsurf.com</a> team wanted to contribute to the ongoing fight against COVID-19 and has designed <strong>a set of vector icons</strong> dedicated to the Coronavirus, or specifically, COVID-19. <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/av_tyschenko\">Anthony Tyschenko</a> and <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/GraphicSurf\">Dennis Machuca</a> took part in the design of the icons.</p>\n<p>The goal was to <strong>save time for designers</strong> who create visual materials to inform people. The well-known stickers remind you to <strong>wear a mask and keep your distance</strong>. From information material for airports and train stations and simple pointers to help people find the next spot where they can get tested, to badges for hotels and restaurants that an object has been disinfected, and so many other use cases. <a href=\"#download-the-icon-set-for-free\">Jump to the free icon pack</a>.</p>\nA Little About The Design Progress\n<p>The complete design of icons, from the idea to the final product, took place in two stages. At the first stage, sketches were drawn on paper, and then transferred to digital format in the Paint Tool SAI 2.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5c2d33a3-8df2-40e0-ab86-4da27750c5b4/sketches-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6dd24d77-7aad-475c-a984-9726a2a23b4b/sketches-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Once the sketches of all the icons were ready, the work moved to Adobe Illustrator. And at this stage, the icons were polished and adjusted.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ae0d10e4-75d3-4b04-98b9-dbe77d295a94/sketches-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<h3>Flexible Customization</h3>\n<p>We tried very hard to design all icons with great attention to detail — but also with fast editing in mind. You can easily change the path, stroke width or corner radius of any icon right inside Adobe Illustrator within just a few seconds.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>56 icons in total</li>\n<li>4 file types (AI, EPS, SVG, PNG)</li>\n<li>3px editable stroke</li>\n<li>2 styles (v, filles outline)</li>\n<li>256×256px (PNG)</li>\n<li>Smooth corners</li>\n<li>Easy to edit and scale</li>\n<li><strong>Fully editable</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Free for personal and commercial use</strong>, but please always provide an attribution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3267dc83-3723-4689-aa3b-4abcdedb9ad1/28-free-vector-covid-19-icons-4.jpg\" /></p>\n<h3>Great Balance And Scalability</h3>\n<p>All of the icons are balanced among each other. You can control stroke weight and corner rounding at any scale with regular scaling (or use the <em>Scale</em> tool to get proportional scaling).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/976425e6-3f28-4975-87dd-08870613dd8c/28-free-vector-covid-19-icons-5.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5dca0f1f-98d9-424b-9d1b-5f1386e17050/28-free-vector-covid-19-icons-6.jpg\" /></p>\nDownload The Icon Set For Free\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://graphicsurf.com/item/coronavirus-vector-icon-set/?utm_campaign=Website&amp;utm_source=smashingmagazine.com&amp;utm_medium=28-icons-pack-covid-19\">GraphicSurf’s official website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://graphicsurf.com/license/\">License</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-freebie-coronavirus-covid19.zip\"><strong>Download the free COVID-19 icons pack</strong></a> (free, ZIP, 3.5 MB)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Editor’s Note: Please Give Credit Where Credit Is Due</h3>\n<p>Please note that this set is available for download on <a href=\"https://graphicsurf.com/item/coronavirus-vector-icon-set/?utm_campaign=Website&amp;utm_source=smashingmagazine.com&amp;utm_medium=28-icons-pack-covid-19\">graphicsurf.com</a> and is royalty-free for use in both personal and commercial projects.</p>\n<p>You can find more details in the <a href=\"https://graphicsurf.com/license/\">license</a>.
