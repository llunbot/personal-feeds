Nineteen months after <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/final-fantasy-vii-remake-spoiler-free-review-our-kind-of-cloud-gaming/\">its launch on PS4</a>Â and seven months after <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-leads-latest-playstation-game-reveal-event/\">its PS5 update</a>, Square Enix's ambitious return to Midgar breaks out of Sony's console family to <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade\">land on PCs</a>.</p>\n<p>If you're the type of <em>Final Fantasy</em> fan who wants little more than a way to play this game on your computer, you can expect a beautiful and mostly solid port that delivers the perks of the PS5 version to many more people. I went into my testing of <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade\"><em>FFVIIR</em> on PC</a> with higher hopes, however. For gamers like me, the news isn't nearly as good, and that makes its unusually high PC price of $70 even harder to swallow.</p>\n<h2>A graphics menu brick wall</h2>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-1308.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-1308-980x551.png\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-1308.png\">You might think that this is the first of multiple graphics settings menus in <em>FFVIIR</em>'s PC version. Nope. This is it.</a> </p></div>\n<p>My first stop before starting any <em>FFVIIR</em> PC gameplay was the options screen, where I slammed into the brick wall that is the above \"graphics\" menu.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1820599#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1820599&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d8865bd6de93c1c05e2faf90514a6a05e20dae477f1a08b8b2f640ce97b09347","category":"Tech"}
