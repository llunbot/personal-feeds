In the past, hackers claimed to have <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3184069/hackers-threaten-to-wipe-millions-of-apple-devices-demand-ransom.html\">millions of stolen iCloud credentials</a> are demanded that Apple pay a ransom. So even as Apple does what it can to protect your data, events like this–though unlikely–can happen. And with all the valuable info on your iPhone these days, you want to make sure nobody can get reset it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But guess what? Using two-factor authentication should protect you completely. It’s easy to set up, so take a minute and do it now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, some Apple services and features <em>require</em> you to have 2FA enabled on your account, as an extra security precaution. Here’s how to set it up on a Mac or iOS device. (Apple Account users who don’t have a compatible device can still use an older two-step verification system. See below for more.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One note: Apple changed the name of Apple ID to Apple Account in iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone and iPad</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow these steps on an iPad or iPhone. These steps are done with iOS 18 or later and should be similar in iPadOS. The device must be protected with a passcode (<em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Touch ID/Face ID &amp; Passcode</em>).</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2fa-ios-18.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 18 2fa two factor authentication\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2fa-ios-18.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2fa-ios-18.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2fa-ios-18.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2fa-ios-18.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2fa-ios-18.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2fa-ios-18.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2fa-ios-18.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2fa-ios-18.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Launch the Settings app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap your Apple Account profile at the top.

Two-factor is on, and this is your official Trusted Device. The next time you sign on to iCloud.com, or set up your iCloud account on a new device, you’ll have to first enter your username and password, and then be prompted to enter a code. That code will come in a pop-up on your trusted devices, texted/phoned to the number you provided, or, you can come back to this screen and tap Get Verification Code.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting this up on a Mac requires nearly the same steps as on an iPhone or iPad.

Plus, the older verification method requires you to hold onto a \n<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/228455/tune-up-your-two-step-recovery-key.html\">Recovery Key</a> in case you ever lose your password. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2017/03/two_factor_mac_popup-100715044-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" alt=\"two factor mac popup\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Two-step verification always sends you a text message.
