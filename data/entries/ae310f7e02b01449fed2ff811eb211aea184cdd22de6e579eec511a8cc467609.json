You can snag this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3W6TV6/\">iPad mini for $399 at Amazon</a>, a savings of $100 and matching the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We loved the iPad mini in our review and appreciated the speedier A17 Pro chip and support for Apple Intelligence and the Apple Pencil Pro. We gave it a 4-star rating and concluded that “the iPad mini is still a great tablet, perhaps the best at its size and better than larger, non-Apple tablets.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tiny tablet is only 8.3 inches across and can easily slip into a beach bag or backpack for summer outdoor activities. It features a gorgeous Liquid Retina display that delivers rich, vibrant colors and impressive contrast, and with the A17 Pro processor, you’ll be able to quickly load apps and games and switch between them without issue. You’re also sure to get OS updates for many years to come. The tablet also comes with 12MP front and back cameras so you can participate in video meetings or snap pics and videos with ease. And since it has the same excellent battery life as Apple’s other iPads, you’ll be able to take it on a trip or hike without worrying when it will need a charge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So don’t miss out on the chance to get the new <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3W6TV6/\">A17 Pro iPad mini for $399 at Amazon</a>, it’s lowest price ever.</p>\n\n\n<span>Grab the tiniest iPad for $100 off </span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3W6TV6/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ae310f7e02b01449fed2ff811eb211aea184cdd22de6e579eec511a8cc467609","category":"Apple"}
