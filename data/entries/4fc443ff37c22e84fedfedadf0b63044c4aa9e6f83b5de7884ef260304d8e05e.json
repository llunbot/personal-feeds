The exhibit embarked on a national tour two years later and has been traveling around the country ever since. And now it's come to the final stop on its journey: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skirball_Cultural_Center\">Skirball Cultural Center</a> in Los Angeles, California, where Gene Roddenberry first created his visionary series, <em>Star Trek: The Original Series</em> (<em>TOS</em>).</p>\n<p>\"Star Trek's vision resonates deeply with the Skirball's commitment to using the power of arts and storytelling to help build a society in which everyone belongs,\" museum director Sheri Bernstein said during the press preview last month.</p>\n<p>Among the highlights of the exhibit are Captain Kirk's command chair, and the wooden helm and navigation console from <em>TOS</em>, fully restored. There are plenty of props: different designs of tricorders, communicators, phasers, and P.A.D.Ds; a model of a Borg cube; and lots of weaponry, including a Klingon disruptor pistol.   </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796392#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796392&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4fc443ff37c22e84fedfedadf0b63044c4aa9e6f83b5de7884ef260304d8e05e","category":"Tech"}
