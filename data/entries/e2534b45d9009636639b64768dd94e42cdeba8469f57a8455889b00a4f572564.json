{"title":"The Best Prime Day Deals on AirPods, iPads, MacBooks, and More","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/best-prime-day-apple-products/","date":1721131142000,"content":"Amazon is back with its annual <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime\">summertime Prime Day event</a>, lasting for just two days from July 16-17. As it does every year, Prime Day offers shoppers a huge selection of deals across Amazon's storefront, including savings on tech, clothing, video games, groceries, and much, much more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/primeday2020_feature3.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor our coverage, we're focusing entirely on discounts for Apple and Apple-related products that can be purchased right now on Amazon. As of today, this includes deals on AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, MacBook Air, and more. We're also sharing deals being matched at retailers like Best Buy in some cases.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs is typical for Prime Day deals, these markdowns are very time sensitive, so sales listed below may disappear fast, and new ones may appear even faster. With this in mind, we'll keep this article updated over the next few days, and keep an eye on the MacRumors front page as we'll be posting particularly great deals in separate articles next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, Amazon Prime Day requires you to have an <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime\"><strong>Amazon Prime membership</strong></a> to take advantage of the discounts. Amazon Prime costs $14.99 per month or $139.00 per year, and it comes with a 30-day free trial for new subscribers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>AirPods</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/airpods-prime-day-24.jpg\" width=\"2002\" height=\"1126\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStarting with AirPods, you'll find a wide selection of solid deals across the AirPods lineup on Amazon during Prime Day.
