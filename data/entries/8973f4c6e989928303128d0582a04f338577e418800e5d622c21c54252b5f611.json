Here's everything we know so far based on rumors and Apple's other releases.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/HomePod-Mini-2-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe ‌HomePod mini‌ was announced in October 2020 at Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> event. Less than half a year later, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/\">discontinued</a> the original <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, leaving the ‌HomePod mini‌ as the company's only smart speaker until earlier this year when Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-announces-new-homepod/\">relaunched the full-size HomePod</a> form factor.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe newly reintroduced ‌HomePod‌ offers a large number of features that were previously exclusive to the ‌HomePod mini‌, including an Apple Watch S-series chip, a U1 ultra wideband chip, Thread support, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/homepods-now-feature-temperature-humidity-sensor/\">temperature and humidity sensor</a>, and a larger backlit touch surface that illuminates from edge to edge.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> was first to highlight Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/07/new-homepod-mini-and-high-end-homepod/\">work on a second-generation HomePod mini</a> in August 2022. Gurman has since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/22/gurman-apple-not-working-on-new-homepod-mini/\">expressed skepticism</a> about what a new ‌HomePod mini‌ could offer since \"the latest ‌HomePod‌ doesn't include any major new functions that aren't already in the $99 mini.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn February, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that Apple will begin mass shipments of the second-generation ‌HomePod mini‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/03/homepod-mini-2-shipping-next-year/\">in the second half of 2024</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA second-generation ‌HomePod mini‌ could conceivably introduce a lower-latency Handoff experience, improved sound and microphones, and the S7, S8, S9, or S10 chip. Many <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> requests are processed locally, meaning that responsiveness could benefit from an improved chip. A new ‌HomePod mini‌ could also see specification upgrades, such as Wi-Fi 6E support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌HomePod mini‌ currently contains the S5 chip from the Apple Watch Series 5 and first-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a>. Late 2024 will likely see the introduction of the Apple Watch Series 10 and the S10 chip, so that's the most advanced chip Apple could feasibly give the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 2023 ‌HomePod‌ contains the S7 chip, the same chip used in 2021's Apple Watch Series 7.  Despite the introduction of the S8 chip in late 2022 in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, and second-generation ‌Apple Watch SE‌, Apple elected to use the S7 chip. This suggests it isn't certain that Apple will use its latest S-series chip in the second-generation ‌HomePod mini‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe S6, S7, and S8 chips are all fundamentally the same and based on the A13 Bionic chip. The S9 chip, on the other hand, is expected to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/apple-watch-series-9-updated-chip/\">based on the A15 Bionic chip</a>, leading to major performance and efficiency improvements. The S6, S7, or S8 chip would be a notable upgrade for the ‌HomePod mini‌, but the S9 or S10 chip could offer even more substantial enhancements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt also seems highly likely that a new ‌HomePod mini‌ will come in a refreshed selection of color options. The current device is available in Space Gray, Blue, Yellow, White, and Orange. With the reintroduced full-size ‌HomePod‌, Apple swapped Space Gray for Midnight, so a similar switch seems likely for the ‌HomePod mini‌ at a minimum.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is also possible that Apple could wait to introduce a new ‌HomePod mini‌ until the debut of a third-generation full-size ‌HomePod‌, especially if it includes new features. Apple is developing an updated version of the ‌HomePod‌ that will feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/\">7-inch display</a>, according to ‌Ming-Chi Kuo‌. The ‌HomePod‌ with a 7-inch display is expected to come out <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/homepod-with-screen-delayed-next-year/\">next year at the earliest</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/21/homepod-mini-2-everything-we-know/\">HomePod Mini 2: Everything We Know So Far</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homepod-mini-2-everything-we-know-so-far.2396545/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8973f4c6e989928303128d0582a04f338577e418800e5d622c21c54252b5f611","category":"Apple"}
