Great 40-mile ride through the Driftless terrain of south central Wisconsin. The goat, Thor, stays along the road to keep the grass and weeds down. He and I have gotten to be pals because I need to stop right where he is for a drink of water and he because I bring him apples and carrots. This is very cool.”</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
