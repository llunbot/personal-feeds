But if you read any of my stuff, you know that I love the utility of a bike with a basket on it, and Old Man Mountian’s new aluminum basket looks awesome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, upon visiting Old Man Mountain’s booth at the Sea Otter Classic last week, I was excited to see some other new bikepacking-specific panniers, a trunk bag, a headlight mount, and a pizza rack added to the “new things to see” list. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Ponderosa Panniers </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Old-Man-Mountian-Ponderosa-Pannier-mounted-from-the-side.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Old-Man-Mountian-Ponderosa-Pannier-mounted-from-the-side-800x601.jpeg\" alt=\"Old Man Mountian Ponderosa Pannier mounted from the side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Old-Man-Mountian-Ponderosa-Pannier-mounted-from-the-side-800x601.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Old-Man-Mountian-Ponderosa-Pannier-mounted-from-the-side-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Old-Man-Mountian-Ponderosa-Pannier-mounted-from-the-side-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Old-Man-Mountian-Ponderosa-Pannier-mounted-from-the-side-768x577.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Old-Man-Mountian-Ponderosa-Pannier-mounted-from-the-side.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo C.

But, on the front side of the pannier, there is another frame sheet.
