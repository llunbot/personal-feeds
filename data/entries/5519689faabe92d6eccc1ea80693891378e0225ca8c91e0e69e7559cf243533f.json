The cheapest model will run you around $1000, with prices quickly going up from there if you want extra storage, memory or a Pro model. Thankfully, there is now an excellent program from Upgraded that helps you spread the cost out over 36 months so that not only can you easily afford the latest Apple laptop, but you can also upgrade every 24 months to a brand-new machine without it emptying your bank account.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Upgraded makes it easy to afford a new MacBook</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For a while now Apple has offered its iPhone Upgrade Program, which lets you pay for a monthly fee for a new iPhone, with the option to replace it with the latest model every 12 months. Sadly, this doesn’t extend to Macs, so Upgraded has come up with an innovative way to help those who want to buy a new MacBook but don’t want to lay down all that cash in one go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of the company’s <a href=\"https://getupgraded.com/?utm_source=macworld&amp;utm_content=april25\">MacBook Upgrade Program</a> is simple. Select the MacBook model you want to buy – either the MacBook Air M4 or MacBook Pro M4 – then put together your preferred configuration of color, memory, and storage. When this is done, you’ll be shown how much the monthly repayments will be across 36 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, you can pick up the baseline MacBook Air M4 with a low cost of $33.28 p/m or the MacBook Pro M4 at only $52.17 p/m. These prices also include AppleCare+, which is standard on all Upgraded plans.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2.-Customize.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Upgraded MacBook Upgrade Program\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2.-Customize.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2.-Customize.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2.-Customize.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2.-Customize.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2.-Customize.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2.-Customize.png?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2.-Customize.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2.-Customize.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Upgraded</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If your credit score is above 740 you’ll have no interest at all, while those with lower scores will pay a variable rate that will be shown on the payment plan breakdown. Upgraded also states that checking for financial eligibility won’t affect your credit score, so there’s no risk at all in applying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best of all, there’s also an option to trade in the MacBook after 24 months, and replace it with a new model instead, meaning you’ll never have to stick with an older machine and miss out on the new features Apple keeps for its latest iterations of the Mac. You can repeat this offer every 24 months, so you’ll always have the latest tech at your fingertips, but without the huge bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who prefer to stick with the initial MacBook can just pay out the 36 months, then the device is theirs to keep forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Good for your pocket and the environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://getupgraded.com/?utm_source=macworld&amp;utm_content=april25\">MacBook Upgrade Program</a> is backed by some of the tech industry’s most respected names, so you know your money is safe and you’ll be getting the devices direct from trusted sellers. All the MacBooks are supplied by GatorTec, an Apple Premier Partner, and the financing comes from Citizens Pay, which is the same bank used for Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upgraded is also backed by OpenAI President Greg Brockman as well as US tech startup accelerator Y Combinator whose previous successes include AirBnB, Reddit, Dropbox, and Twitch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company’s commitment to the environment also means you can buy with confidence, as all MacBooks that are returned after 24-months as part of the upgrade program are refurbished and given a new lease on life, ensuring they don’t end up in a landfill contributing to the growing problem of e-waste.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4.-Account.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Upgraded MacBook Upgrade Program\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4.-Account.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4.-Account.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4.-Account.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4.-Account.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4.-Account.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4.-Account.png?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4.-Account.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4.-Account.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Upgraded</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get yourself a new MacBook today with Upgraded</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Times are tough at the moment, with prices already beginning to rise across the world due to trade friction and inflation.
