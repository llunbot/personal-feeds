There wasn't much resale incentive on the open market, because the screen was far from pristine and the battery was nearly 5 years old. You can <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Apple+Watch+Series+5+Battery+Replacement/136871\">replace the battery yourself</a>, but, already having a lot of fix projects on the shelf, I opted to send it off, take a gift card, and move on.</p>\n<p>If I get a chance, though, I'm going to ask Apple for that watch back. Apple can keep its estimated $90. I am cautiously but earnestly optimistic that the <a href=\"https://thetinypod.com/\">tinyPod</a> can give me more value than a gift card number I plow into some future iPhone upgrade. In fact, the tinyPod, according to its creator, should go on sale for around that $90 mark after a more detailed reveal in June.</p>\n<div><blockquote><p>This summer.

Once inside the case, the scroll wheel function is \"entirely analog and physically rotates the watch crown,\" according to tinyPod founder <a href=\"https://x.com/sentry\">Newar</a>, better known as \"Sentry\" on X (formerly Twitter) and in jailbreaking circles. The crown-moving mechanism and general case enhancements to the Watch are patent-pending, Newar wrote by email. More on the scroll wheel will be shown next month, he wrote, at a \"proper launch.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027388#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027388&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3a6cab3a65374771026904f6a74838ae28464a76d0c91a95ee0c8485e2c81cd5","category":"Tech"}
