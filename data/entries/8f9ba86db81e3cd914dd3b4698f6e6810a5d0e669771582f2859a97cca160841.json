{"title":"Tour de France prize money: How much does the winner receive?","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-prize-money","date":1689247800000,"content":"\n      <p>The <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> is undoubtedly the most iconic race on the cycling calendar, with the yellow jersey being the most elusive prize.<span> </span>However, it isn’t just stages and a range of colourful jerseys that the riders can win over the three weeks, there’s plenty of prize money on offer too.</p>\n<div></div>\n<p>Race organiser ASO has provided a total prize pot for this year’s Tour of approximately €2,300,000 – equivalent to around £1,984,000. This fund will be shared between the top riders in each classification, from the overall race winner down to the most combative rider at the Tour – as well as the top finishers on each stage, and the first few over the line at intermediate sprints and <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/how-are-the-tour-de-france-climbs-classified\">categorised climbs</a>.</p>\n<p>The winner of each stage of the Tour, alongside writing their name into the history books, secures a sum of €11,000 for crossing the line first. That figure is halved for second-place, €5,500, with the third-place finisher picking up €2,800. Every rider in the top-20 on the day will rake in some prize money for their troubles even if it is just €300 for the 20th<span> </span>placed rider on the stage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-09850.jpg?v=1689250944\" alt /><em>Jonas Vingegaard won last year's Tour de France and hopes to achieve the same feat this year (Zac Williams/SWPix.com)</em></p>\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-yellow-jersey-at-the-tour-de-france-a-brief-history\">maillot jaune</a> itself may be the only prize that the likes of Tadej Pogačar or Jonas Vingegaard have their eyes set on, it is accompanied by a handsome cheque of €500,000 should they have the jersey on their back by the time they reach the Champs-Élysées. For every stage a rider is in the yellow jersey they will add €500 to their winnings too.</p>\n<p>The runner-up in the general classification will take home €200,000, with the final man on the podium earning half of that, €100,000. Outside of the podium places, riders down to 19th in the general classification will earn anywhere between €70,000 and €1,100. After that, every rider that crosses the finish line in Paris sitting above 160th position will collect €1,000 for their efforts.</p>\n<p>The fight for the green jersey is not only hotly contested at the Tour but also lucrative too.<span> </span></p>\n<p>Alongside the stage finishes where the winner rakes in €11,000, the intermediate sprints on each road stage provide a financial incentive for the fast men. Victory at an intermediate sprint secures €1,500 for the rider, with second and third picking up €1,000 and €500 respectively.<span>  </span>Should a sprinter pick up enough points to pull on the <em>maillot vert</em>, they’ll pocket €300 for every stage that they keep the jersey. The overall winner of classification, who will no doubt be looking to win cycling’s most iconic sprint finish on the Champs-Élysées too, will secure €25,000.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AW7_9711.jpg?v=1689251082\" alt /><em>The green jersey is awarded to the rider with the most amount of points, and so far this year, Jasper Philipsen is in the lead (Alex Whitehead/SWPix.com)</em></p>\n<p>For the riders that fare better when the race is going uphill, the King of the Mountains classification also provides some financial incentives too.</p>\n<p>Wearing the polka-dot jersey for a stage is worth €300, with each categorised climb along the Tour’s route worth anywhere between €5,000 and €200 for the riders over the summit first. Okay, admittedly only one climb provides a prize of €5,000, but it is a very special one. The Souvenir <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/who-was-henri-desgrange\">Henri Desgrange</a>, named in honour of the Tour’s creator and first race director, is an award given to the rider that is first to summit the race’s highest peak each year.</p>\n<p>For the 2023 edition, the prize will be given to the first rider over the top of the 2,302m-high Col de Loze on stage 17. For the rest of the climbs, the prize money varies in the hundreds of euros. The first three riders over a <em>hors categorie</em> climb, of which there are six in this year’s race, will scoop up €800, €450, and €300 respectively.</p>\n<p>A first category climb is slightly lower in terms of prize money, with the first rider picking up €650, followed by €400 and €150 for the second and third riders over the top. Second category climbs see the first rider over the top collecting €500, with €250 for the runner-up. When it comes to third and fourth category climbs, there is only a financial reward for the first rider over the top of them – given their frequency and less testing gradients. A rider will pick up €300 for a third category peak, and just €200 for a fourth category climb.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ZW-08128.jpg?v=1689251265\" alt /><em>Not only did he win the yellow jersey, Jonas Vingegaard also won the polka jersey in the 2022 edition (Zac Williams/SWPix.com)</em></p>\n<p>The young rider classification may be the smallest competition when it comes to prize money, but it can still be rewarding for an up-and-coming rider. Just like other sub-classifications, a day in the jersey means a €300 cheque, however, the highest ranked young rider on each stage will also collect €500 too. The four best young riders at the end of the three-week tour will earn prize money for their efforts. The winner will rake in €20,000, before the prize money then decreases by €5,000 for each position within the top four.</p>\n<p>The team classification is determined by the cumulative time of each team’s three fastest finishers on each stage. The team with the best combined time will receive €2,800 to share amongst their riders and staff. At the end of the tour, the top five teams in the sub-classification will earn between €50,000 for the winning squad and €8,000 for the fifth-placed team.<span> </span></p>\n<p>The final prize on offer at Le Tour is awarded by race judges to the most aggressive rider on each road stage – often this is the rider that was the last man standing in the day’s break. As the most combative rider, they earn themselves €2,000 for their efforts and are given a red race number, or dossard, for the next stage. When the race concludes in Paris, a Super Combatif award is given out to the rider deemed to have been the most aggressive over the entire race – they also collect a cheque for €20,000.</p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"8f9ba86db81e3cd914dd3b4698f6e6810a5d0e669771582f2859a97cca160841","category":"Cycling"}
