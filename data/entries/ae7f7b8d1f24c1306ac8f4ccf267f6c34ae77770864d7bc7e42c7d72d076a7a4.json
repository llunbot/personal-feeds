How have you been since then?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fred Wright: I think I can count myself quite lucky it was just concussion. The damage that crash did to a lot of the other riders was much worse. I spent a week recovering, very bored at home in bed. I didn’t even want to look at screens – it was a case of just resting my head. I still had mild symptoms six days later. Now, happy days, I’m completely back to normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m grateful the concussion protocols are what they are – a couple of years ago I’d have been put into the Amstel Gold Race and that would have messed up the rest of the year. That crash is not what I want to happen in my next crack at Roubaix, but there’s plenty more chances to go for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is the performance you’re happiest about so far in your career?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably the 2022 Tour of Flanders. The Tour and Vuelta went really well but I took a lot of confidence from that seventh place [at Flanders]. That was maybe the point where I realised I can definitely be there in the biggest races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’ve talked before about feeling impostor syndrome. Is that going away? You need a bit of ego to be up there.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You definitely need a bit. I sometimes think maybe I don’t have enough but even at this year’s Tour of Flanders I knew I could be there. That’s already a big step from before. I knew what I needed to do to be in the same position again, and it was nice to finish eighth and sort of show I didn’t get lucky last year. I’m definitely going to be knocking on the door of those big one-day races for as long as possible. I’ll keep putting myself in the right place and I hope it will happen – Pogačar might have a puncture one year.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"688\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/fred-wright-QA-2-688x970.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/fred-wright-QA-2-688x970.jpg 688w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/fred-wright-QA-2-213x300.jpg 213w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/fred-wright-QA-2-768x1083.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/fred-wright-QA-2-1089x1536.jpg 1089w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/fred-wright-QA-2-750x1058.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/fred-wright-QA-2-1140x1607.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/fred-wright-QA-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>David Powell</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>You’ve made a habit of getting into breakaways. How do you deal with the mind games once you’re in there?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the part I need to work on a little bit. I always get told I do too much, I’m just quite eager, but at the same time you want there to be cohesion in the group. You can roll through quite easily and keep things moving without expending too much energy and starting to attack each other. I guess it’s finding the balance. I’m putting myself in those positions but it’s that little bit of finishing it off, finessing, that I’ve maybe missed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’re still missing your first pro win. Have you thought about your victory celebration for when it happens?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just some sort of stupid disbelief one probably. It’s only a matter of time really. I do feel it’s probably going to be a big one, as I tend to just do the big races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This interview was conducted before the tragic passing of Wright’s friend and teammate Gino Mäder and before he got his first pro win at the National Championships, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cyclist/status/1673027292128325634?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">he dedicated that win to Gino</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s your favourite place to ride in the UK?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I live really close to the Peak District. On a sunny day there’s no place I’d rather be. I think three hours is a good length of time for a ride because it goes by quickly. I have a loop I do: up Brickworks, then Windgather, Goyt Valley, over the top of Cat and Fiddle and some extra miles before home.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"842\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg 842w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-750x265.jpg 750w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>British cycling isn’t having such a sunny period – the AT85 men’s team has closed and the Women’s Tour is on hold. How does it make you feel?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s so sad to see guys I raced with as juniors on that AT85 team, such great riders that really deserve to make a living out of being a cyclist, whether that’s as a WorldTour pro or whatever. I think with the amount of time you have to put in, there isn’t enough coming from the British scene to make it worth it anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have no idea what the answer is. It’s all well and good saying there needs to be more money but where does that money come from? At the moment, most of the funding in the sport is from really rich people who like cycling. In the national scene, they don’t see the value in it, I guess. Somehow, we’ve got to show them it’s worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Then there’s Belgium, where there’s a different respect and cycling culture. Did you have drivers rolling their windows down and saying, ‘Come on Fred!’ while based there during the spring season?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be fair, the other week when I was riding near Whaley Bridge [in the Peak District], I thought this van driver was going to give me abuse, but then he said, ‘Go on Fred, keep up the good work!’ It was so out of the blue, so not what you expect. Who knows – maybe more documentaries and things on Netflix will encourage people to follow cycling a bit more.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/netflix-unchained-review\">Netflix’s Tour de France Unchained review: An entertaining recap with a Pogačar-shaped hole</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2023: Stage-by-stage preview and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p><strong>What were you doing to unwind this spring?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the run-up to the Tour of Flanders, staying in a big villa together, the team played a lot of this card game called Trumps. You have to guess how many sets you’re going to win. It was getting quite competitive – the nutritionist made a full Excel spreadsheet with everyone’s scores. I think I was top. I definitely won three nights in a row.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are you competitive with everything you do?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My family played so many board games when I was younger and we still do now if I’m back at Christmas. My favourite is Settlers Of Catan – we’ve got all the expansion packs. It’s quite nerdy really, but we get proper into it. I guess that’s where I get some of my competitive edge in racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 141 of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fred-wright-cyclist\">Fred Wright Q&amp;A: ‘Only a matter of time, really’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"ae7f7b8d1f24c1306ac8f4ccf267f6c34ae77770864d7bc7e42c7d72d076a7a4","category":"Cycling"}
