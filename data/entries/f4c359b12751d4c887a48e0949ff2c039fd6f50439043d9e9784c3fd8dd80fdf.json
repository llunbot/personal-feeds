The feature has been rolling out to PlayStation 5 users over the course of the last few weeks, but it is now available more widely and also on the PS4.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/apple-play-playstation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe option to use ‌Apple Pay‌ is notable because it is a feature that works when you're making PlayStation Store purchases directly on a PS4 or PS5 from the television interface. To do so, add a game to your cart and then go to checkout.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the checkout interface, select ‌Apple Pay‌. From there, the PlayStation will display an Apple payment code (essentially an Apple-designed QR code) that can be scanned with an ‌iPhone‌ or an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, with payment confirmed through biometric authentication.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple implemented support for this type of payment with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> last year. It also works for purchases on third-party browsers like Chrome and Firefox.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Apple Pay‌ is available alongside PayPal and traditional debit and credit card payment options on Sony's consoles, and using ‌Apple Pay‌ may be more secure and convenient than entering in a credit or debit card number.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/playstation/\">PlayStation</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/05/playstation-apple-pay-support/\">PlayStation Adds Apple Pay Support for PS4 and PS5 Store Purchases</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/playstation-adds-apple-pay-support-for-ps4-and-ps5-store-purchases.2458252/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f4c359b12751d4c887a48e0949ff2c039fd6f50439043d9e9784c3fd8dd80fdf","category":"Apple"}
