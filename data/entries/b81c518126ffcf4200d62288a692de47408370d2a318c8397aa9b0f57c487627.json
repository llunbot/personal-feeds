It’s 100 miles from anywhere, to anywhere.</p>\n<p>And it’s the bucket list ride that Lachlan Morton spent years dreaming about.</p>\n<p>Starting in Banff, Alberta, Canada and ending 2,671 miles later in Antelope Wells, New Mexico, USA, the Divide Route is as beautiful as it is rugged, as ambitious as it is empty. During his two weeks on the trail, Lachlan felt more scared, more cold, more capable, and more alive than ever.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the latest EF Pro Cycling Explore film, “The Divide,” presented by Wahoo.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/watch-the-divide-lachlan-morton-rides-the-tour-divide/\">Watch The Divide: Lachlan Morton Rides the Tour Divide</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Hailey Moore","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"b81c518126ffcf4200d62288a692de47408370d2a318c8397aa9b0f57c487627","category":"Cycling"}
