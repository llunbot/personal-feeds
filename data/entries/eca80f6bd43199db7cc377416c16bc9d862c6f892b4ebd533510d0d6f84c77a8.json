Brommie fans have always loved the compact, go-anywhere lifestyle of the bikes that fold down smaller than a suitcase – so small they’ll fit under your desk at work, in a train, a plane, a taxi, any car trunk… pretty much anywhere. But you never could fit very wide tires in them, so while you could commute to work or travel the world with your Brompton, you couldn’t really go much beyond where the pavement ends. That all changes with the G Line, and a set of off-road capable 2.1″ gravel tires!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Brompton G Line 20″ adventure-ready folding gravel bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Brompton G Line folding adventure gravel bike riding with 20&quot; wheels and 2.1&quot; tires\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Brompton-G-Line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-20inch-wheels_riding-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Brompton)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I dove fully <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/brompton-g-line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-on-20inch-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">into the details last autumn</a>, and you can read <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/brompton-g-line-folding-adventure-gravel-bike-on-20inch-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>here</em></a> to learn more.

Think of its rollerover improvement like going from 26” to 29” wheels. Plus, now you can find lots more compatible tires – from road slicks to gravel to XC-ish mountain bike tires (like on high-end kids’ bikes!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bigger wheels also forced Brompton’s hand on making a slightly longer wheelbase, which boosts overall rider fit <em>AND</em> more stable handling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s still a compact folder, but should ride now more like a full-sized bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Now, as more and more people look to escape the city, exploring roads and trails less traveled, it was the right time to take everything that makes the Brompton so special, and make it capable of going beyond the urban environment and into tougher terrain.”</p>\n<cite><em>– Will Butler-Adams, Brompton CEO</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Brompton G Line – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Brompton-G-Line-in-the-USA_steel-adventure-ready-20inch-wheel-folding-gravel-bike_USA-spec.webp\"><img width=\"1350\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Brompton-G-Line-in-the-USA_steel-adventure-ready-20inch-wheel-folding-gravel-bike_USA-spec.webp\" alt=\"Brompton G Line in the USA steel adventure-ready 20&quot; wheel folding gravel bike, USA build spec\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Brompton-G-Line-in-the-USA_steel-adventure-ready-20inch-wheel-folding-gravel-bike_USA-spec.webp 1350w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Brompton-G-Line-in-the-USA_steel-adventure-ready-20inch-wheel-folding-gravel-bike_USA-spec-297x176.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Brompton-G-Line-in-the-USA_steel-adventure-ready-20inch-wheel-folding-gravel-bike_USA-spec-120x71.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Brompton-G-Line-in-the-USA_steel-adventure-ready-20inch-wheel-folding-gravel-bike_USA-spec-768x455.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Brompton G Line gravel folder has already been available as a pre-order recently, but this week they actually start shipping. $3300 will get you a standard Brompton G Line in one of 3 cockpit sizes (S, M &amp; L) and your choice of 3 colors – Adventure orange, Forest green &amp; Traildust white.
