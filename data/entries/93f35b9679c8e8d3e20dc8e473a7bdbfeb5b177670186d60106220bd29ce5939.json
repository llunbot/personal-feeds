While this comes as no surprise, it means that next year's iPhone 17 models should have modestly improved performance and power efficiency compared to iPhone 16 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrevious reports indicated that TSMC would begin mass production of chips built with the N3P process in the second half of 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2026, Apple is expected to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/iphone-18-enhanced-2nm-chip-12gb-ram/\">use TSMC's first 2nm process</a> for A20 chips in iPhone 18 models.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/a19-and-a19-pro-n3p-rumor/\">iPhone 17: Newer 3nm Technology Expected for A19 and A19 Pro Chips</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-newer-3nm-technology-expected-for-a19-and-a19-pro-chips.2443366/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"93f35b9679c8e8d3e20dc8e473a7bdbfeb5b177670186d60106220bd29ce5939","category":"Apple"}
