The setting comes as mercenary malware sold by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/jury-orders-nso-to-pay-167-million-for-hacking-whatsapp-users/\">NSO Group</a> and a cottage industry of other exploit sellers continues to thrive. These players provide attacks-as-a-service through end-to-end platforms that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities on targeted devices, infect them with advanced spyware, and then capture contacts, message histories, locations, and other sensitive information. Over the past decade, phones running fully updated versions of Android and iOS have routinely been hacked through these services.</p>\n<h2>A core suite of enhanced security features</h2>\n<p>Advanced Protection is Googleâ€™s latest answer to this type of attack. By flipping a single button in device settings, users can enable a host of protections that can thwart some of the most common techniques used in sophisticated hacks. In some cases, the protections hamper performance and capabilities of the device, so Google is recommending the new mode mainly for journalists, elected officials, and other groups who are most often targeted or have the most to lose when infected.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/google-introduces-advanced-protection-mode-for-its-most-at-risk-android-users/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/google-introduces-advanced-protection-mode-for-its-most-at-risk-android-users/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d04f68c87385fa2b6681a1724f6469d58475e01e032679abb463dc61dc67e99c","category":"Tech"}
