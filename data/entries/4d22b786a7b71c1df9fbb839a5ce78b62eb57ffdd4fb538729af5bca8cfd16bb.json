The rear end is the same as the full-aluminium bike, keeping the Horst-link suspension layout and alloy rocker link.</p>\n<p>The material may be new, but the geometry, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">130mm of rear travel</a>, suspension design and Ride Aligned Design System are maintained.</p>\n<h2>New Carbon front end, same alloy rear</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2024 Norco Fluid FS Carbon front triangle\" title=\"N_230504_Norco-Fluid_AS-5114_H\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 2024 Fluid FS C uses an all-new carbon front triangle, but shares geometry with its aluminium sibling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Norco</i></span></div>\n<p>The key difference in the Fluid FS Carbon is the new carbon fibre front triangle.</p>\n<p>Norco claims a weight saving of 600g without compromising strength or durability, saying it’s tested to the same degree as the aluminium version.</p>\n<p>Just as the Ride Aligned Design System tailors the geometry, the brand claims the carbon layup and construction have been tuned to provide the correct strength and stiffness for all riders and frame sizes.</p>\n<p>The rest of the frame is shared with the aluminium version, including the rear triangle, rocker link and suspension kinematics.</p>\n<p>Norco claims this ensures it shares the same suspension performance, regardless of frame size or material.</p>\n<h2>Like the Optic, but different…</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2024 Norco Fluid FS Carbon full bike shot\" title=\"N_230504_Norco-Fluid_AS-5094_H\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Fluid may be similar on paper to Norco’s own Optic, but the brand claims the bikes have very different personalities.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Norco</i></span></div>\n<p>On paper, the Fluid looks much like the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/norco-optic-c3-review/\">Norco Optic</a>.</p>\n<p>The brand is keen to stress they are very different bikes, despite sharing similar travel numbers and geometry.</p>\n<p>Norco claim the Optic is more about high-speed capability and a focus on total trail clarity over rough terrain.</p>\n<p>The Fluid, on the other hand, is intended to offer a more balanced, well-rounded ride.</p>\n<h2>Ride Aligned Design System makes for size-specific geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2024 Norco Fluid being ridden by male cyclist round berm\" title=\"N_230504_Norco-Fluid_AS-1868_H\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Fluid uses Norco’s Ride Aligned Design System to offer a balanced ride and easy setup for all riders.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Norco</i></span></div>\n<p>Norco’s Ride Aligned Design System brings size-specific chainstay lengths and seat tube angles, with the stays getting longer and the seat tube steeper as the sizes increase, alongside the brand’s Ride Aligned Bike Setup Guide.</p>\n<p>Norco claims this enables any rider to tune the suspension and ride position in minutes, with recommended stem lengths, bar widths and rises, stem spacers, tyre pressure and suspension settings by entering your height, weight and skill level.</p>\n<p>With a 65-degree head angle, 480mm reach and 435mm chainstays on a size large, the Fluid’s numbers aren’t overly extreme, but right in the ballpark for aggressive <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">trail bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>To match the aggression, the frame features low standover heights, the seat tubes are kept short (410mm in the case of the large size) and the seatpost is 34.9mm in diameter. This means you can fit the longest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper posts</a> with ease.</p>\n<p>To prove the point, the size-large bike comes with a 200mm dropper seatpost as standard.</p>\n<p>An integrated accessory mount is provided under the top tube, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/sram-udh/\">SRAM’s Universal Derailleur Hanger</a> interface and a threaded bottom bracket.</p>\n<p>There’s room for up to 2.6in tyres and space for a 750ml water bottle inside the front triangle on all sizes, as well as custom-tuned <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-rockshox-super-deluxe/\">RockShox Super Deluxe rear shocks</a> on all models.</p>\n<h2>Trail-ready spec and multiple build options</h2>\n<p>The new Fluid FS Carbon is available now in three complete bike options, C1, C2 and C3, as well as a frameset-only option.</p>\n<p>To go with the RockShox rear shocks, all complete-bike models get 140mm-travel <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-rockshox-pike-lyrik-zeb/\">RockShox Pike</a> forks, four-piston brakes with big 200/180mm rotors, long-travel dropper posts and 800mm-wide bars to maximise control of the tubeless Vittoria Mazza/Martello tyre combo.</p>\n<p>Prices kick off at £4,199/$4,099 for the base SRAM SX/NX-equipped C3 model, rising to £6,599/$5,999 for the C1 range-topper decked out in SRAM’s new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-gx-eagle-transmission/\">GX Eagle Transmission</a>.</p>\n<p>The frameset costs £2,249, although we’re awaiting news on other international pricing.</p>\n<p>We have a Fluid FS C2 winging its way to us, so stay tuned for a full review in the future.</p>\n<h2>Spec and pricing details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2024 Norco Fluid FS C1 Green/White\" title=\"MY23_Norco_Fluid_FS_C1_GREEN_WHITE_WT\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 2024 Norco Fluid FS C1.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Norco</i></span></div>\n<h3>Norco Fluid FS C1</h3>\n<p><strong>Fork:</strong> RockShox Pike Ultimate, 140mm travel, 44mm offset</p>\n<p><strong>Shock:</strong> RockShox Super Deluxe Ultimate, custom tuned</p>\n<p><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> SRAM GX Eagle Transmission</p>\n<p><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM G2 RSC, 4-piston</p>\n<p><strong>Wheelset:</strong> Crankbrothers Synthesis</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> £6,599/$5,999</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2024 Norco Fluid FS C2 Black/Chrome\" title=\"MY23_Norco_Fluid_FS_C2_Black_Chrome_WT\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 2024 Norco Fluid FS C2.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Norco</i></span></div>\n<h3>Norco Fluid FS C2</h3>\n<p><strong>Fork:</strong> RockShox Pike Select+, 140mm travel, 44mm offset</p>\n<p><strong>Shock:</strong> RockShox Super Deluxe Select+ custom tuned</p>\n<p><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> SRAM GX Eagle</p>\n<p><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM G2 R, 4-piston</p>\n<p><strong>Wheelset:</strong> WTB ST Light rims on Bear Pawls sealed bearing hubs</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> £4,999/$4,999</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Norco Fluid FS C3</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2024 Norco Optic FS C3 Copper/Black\" title=\"MY24_Norco_Fluid_FS_C3_Copper_Black_WT\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 2024 Norco Fluid FS C3.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Norco</i></span></div>\n<p><strong>Fork:</strong> RockShox Pike Select, 140mm travel, 44mm offset</p>\n<p><strong>Shock: </strong>RockShox Super Deluxe Select+ custom tuned</p>\n<p><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> SRAM SX/NX Eagle</p>\n<p><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM DB8, 4-piston</p>\n<p><strong>Wheelset:</strong> WTB ST rims on Bear Pawls sealed bearing hubs</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> £4,199/$4,099</p>\n<h3>Norco Fluid FS C frameset</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2024 Norco Fluid FS C Frameset Green/White\" title=\"MY24_FLUID_C_C1_GREEN_WHITE_WT\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 2024 Norco Fluid FS C frameset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Norco</i></span></div>\n<p><strong>Shock:</strong> RockShox Super Deluxe Ultimate, custom tuned</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> £2,249 (international pricing &amp; availability TBC)</p>","author":"Tom Law","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"4d22b786a7b71c1df9fbb839a5ce78b62eb57ffdd4fb538729af5bca8cfd16bb","category":"Cycling"}
