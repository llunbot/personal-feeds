{"title":"Eddy and Tim’s Excellent Super Bowl Adventure","link":"https://x.com/johnsummit/status/1888373521123819528","date":1739069283000,"content":"\n<p>Looks like more of an Eddy scene than a Tim scene, but everyone’s having fun. There’s a reason this is the 11th Super Bowl held in New Orleans.</p>\n\n<p>Should be a good football game, too. The Chiefs and Eagles are both very good teams (and <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/gm-report/chiefs-senior-vp-of-football-operations-on-why-brett-veach-is-a-hall-of-fame-gm\">both</a> very <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/sports/football/nfl-super-bowl-howie-roseman-philadelphia-eagles-7b5a906d\">well-run</a> franchises). There’s a strong case to be made that these are the two best teams in the NFL this season. And without question they’re two of the top four (I’d add the Bills and Ravens). If you’re only a casual fan, you might think that happens every year. A championship game, ideally, would always feature two of the very best teams.

This year it did. What’s similar about both the Chiefs and Eagles is that both teams are full of surprises and tricks — they often do things no one would expect. But even more often, <em>they do exactly what everyone expects them to do</em>, the most predictable thing possible, and it just can’t be stopped even when the other team knows it’s coming.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/eddy-and-tim\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5af1b3b39b59fed5e88a7bfc266a131118d58b3b280bd83c973b4e172f9ac396","category":"Tech"}
