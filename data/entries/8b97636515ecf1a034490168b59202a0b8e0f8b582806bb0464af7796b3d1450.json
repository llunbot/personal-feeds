The goal was to improve the processing technology and deliver highly accurate heart rate monitoring metrics. The team also looked at some of the shortcomings of the TICKR HRM units. Reliability being a key focus as reports of TICKR monitors spontaneously not working, is on the rise. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TRACKR-on-Bike.jpg\"><img width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TRACKR-on-Bike.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TRACKR-on-Bike.jpg 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TRACKR-on-Bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TRACKR-on-Bike-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TRACKR-on-Bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TRACKR-on-Bike-768x512.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Reliable </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The TRACKER design team put the new unit through a gauntlet of rugged testing, taking athletes’ feedback into consideration with design features. The new unit is rated IPX7 and is equipped for rainy rides, sweaty runs, and muddy cyclocross races. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TRACKR-Charging.jpg\"><img width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TRACKR-Charging.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TRACKR-Charging.jpg 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TRACKR-Charging-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TRACKR-Charging-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TRACKR-Charging-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TRACKR-Charging-768x512.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rechargeable </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The TRACKR heart rate monitor comes with a high-capacity, rechargeable battery that provides over 100 hours of active battery life in most conditions.

It works with Wahoo ecosystem units like the ELEMNT computers. But it also pairs easily with any GPS smartwatch or smartphone. It is compatible with Apple Watch, Zwift, STRAVA, Adidas Running, Nike Run Club, Peloton, and the Wahoo ecosystem of apps and training products.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We are thrilled to launch the TRACKR HEART RATE monitor. Our goal was to create a device that athletes can rely on for accurate data, unmatched comfort, and seamless integration with their training ecosystems. TRACKR HEART RATE is designed to meet the needs of the most demanding athletes, providing them with the tools to optimize their training and achieve their performance goals.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Gareth Joyce, CEO of Wahoo,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TRACKR is the first in Wahoo’s newly branded TRACKR lineup of accessories.
