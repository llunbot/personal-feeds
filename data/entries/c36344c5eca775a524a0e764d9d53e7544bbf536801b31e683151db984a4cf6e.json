Kennedy Jr. is facing criticism for his equivocal response to the raging measles outbreak in West Texas, which as of Tuesday has grown to <a href=\"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-march-4-2025\">159 cases</a>, with 22 hospitalizations and one child death.</p>\n<p>While public health officials would like to see a resounding endorsement of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine as the best way to protect children and vulnerable community members from further spread of the extremely infectious virus, Kennedy instead penned <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us\">an Op-Ed for Fox News</a> sprinkled with anti-vaccine talking points. Before noting that vaccines \"protect individual children\" and \"contribute to community immunity,\" he stressed parental choice. The decision to vaccinate is \"a personal one,\" he wrote, and merely advised parents to \"consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine.\"</p>\n<p>Further, Kennedy seemed more eager to embrace nutrition and supplements as a way to combat the potentially deadly infection. He declared that the \"best defense\" against infectious diseases, like the measles, is \"good nutrition\"â€”not lifesaving, highly effective vaccines.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/cod-liver-oil-embraced-amid-texas-measles-outbreak-doctors-fight-misinfo/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/cod-liver-oil-embraced-amid-texas-measles-outbreak-doctors-fight-misinfo/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c36344c5eca775a524a0e764d9d53e7544bbf536801b31e683151db984a4cf6e","category":"Tech"}
