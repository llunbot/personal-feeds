He’s almost won it all, completing the ‘Triple Crown’ this season in winning the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2024-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-2024-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/world-championships-mens-road-race-gallery-2024\" target=\"_blank\">World Championships Road Race</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It begs the question: how do you actually beat him? To try and answer that, we’ve ignored the wins and instead looked back at Pogačar’s defeats over the past two seasons for a few clues. To help keep things focussed, we’ve excluded team time-trials and ASO criteriums, and only looked at stage finishes during stage races where Pogačar crossed the line in the top five (to avoid outright bunch sprints or big breakaway days).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out there are four ways in which it is possible to pip Pogačar, so what are they and how often have they been done?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Flat individual time-trial (14% of his losses)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240705TDF0136-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240705TDF0136-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240705TDF0136-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240705TDF0136-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240705TDF0136-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240705TDF0136-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240705TDF0136-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240705TDF0136-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240705TDF0136-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240705TDF0136-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/20240705TDF0136-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With various Grand Tour time-trial victories and three National Championships against the clock to his name, Tadej Pogačar is no slouch in TTs. However there have been three occasions over the past two seasons where he has been defeated in individual time-trials. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big hit came on Stage 16 of the 2023 Tour de France in which he lost 1min 38sec to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Vingegaard</a>. It was an unexpected result and a huge blow to Pogačar’s yellow jersey ambitions given the pair stood just 10sec apart at the beginning of the day, and in the end he wouldn’t claim that time back. Vingegaard said it was the time-trial of his life. It’s hard to disagree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other two instances occurred in Grand Tours this year. Pogačar won the first 40km time-trial at the Giro d’Italia by 17sec over Filippo Ganna, but the tables were turned a week later when Ganna took the top spot by 29sec ahead of Pogačar over a shorter 31km course. It wasn’t an essential win for Pogačar though, as he was already leading the Giro by over three minutes at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Tour de France, it was <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> who prevailed by 12 seconds over a 25.3km flat time-trial, although Pogačar would get his revenge on the final day’s hilly TT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially if you want to beat Pogačar in a time-trial, you need to be at least one of the top five time-triallists in the world.

href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\" target=\"_blank\">Classics</a> as well as stage races and Grand Tours, but he also isn’t trying to win Grand Tour bunch sprints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these losses came from one-day races such as the 2023 E3 Saxo Bank Classic. The trio of Pogačar, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu van der Poel</a> formed the lead group on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/oude-kwaremont-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Oude Kwaremont</a> and, knowing he wouldn’t be the quickest in a sprint, Pogačar tried to attack and drop his rivals in the final kilometres. Both Van Aert and Van der Poel came past him in the sprint to the line, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another instance was Milan-San Remo this year. As usual all eyes were on Pogačar on the Poggio and his <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a> squad came to the fore with Tim Wellens setting a fierce pace. However when Pogačar attacked, riders were able to stick to his wheel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He had greater success when he tried again a few hundred metres later but Van der Poel saw the attack and hunted him down and a sprint it would be. Pogačar tried, apparently putting out a maximum of 1,040W but he didn’t have the power to come around Japser Philipsen or Michael Matthews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the finish, he said, ‘This year was not hard enough to be a climber’s race. I did everything I could to get third place. In this situation, I couldn’t have done much better.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"666\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2161501305-666x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2161501305-666x970.jpg 666w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2161501305-206x300.jpg 206w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2161501305-768x1119.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2161501305-1054x1536.jpg 1054w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2161501305-1406x2048.jpg 1406w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2161501305-750x1092.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2161501305-1140x1661.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-2161501305.jpg 1430w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most surprising defeat in a sprint came at the hands of Vingegaard on Stage 11 of this year’s Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar, in the <em>maillot jaune</em>, distanced everybody with an attack in the last 32km and it looked to be all over, however he seemed to hit a bit of a wall and Vingegaard slowly closed him down. The finish in Le Lioran was slightly uphill after a hard day with over 4,000m of elevation and it came down to a head-to-head battle. The win would go to Vingegaard who had his hands on his head in disbelief – he’d never beaten the Slovenian in a two-up sprint before. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to outsprinting Pogačar, it either needs to be on a flat or nearly flat <em>parcours </em>or you need to hope he blows up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When Pogačar was beaten in a sprint:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>E3 Saxo Bank, 2023 (3rd)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Milan-San Remo, 2024 (3rd)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stage 1 of the Giro d’Italia, 2024 (3rd)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stage 11 of the Tour de France, 2024 (2nd)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>GP Quebec, 2024 (7th)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Take the breakaway all the way (29%)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"691\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2159821361-970x691.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2159821361-970x691.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2159821361-300x214.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2159821361-768x547.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2159821361-1536x1095.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2159821361-2048x1459.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2159821361-120x86.jpg 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2159821361-350x250.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2159821361-750x534.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2159821361-1140x812.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2159821361-190x136.jpg 190w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There can be different definitions here, including whether Pogačar was beaten as a result of the breakaway beating him to the line (eg, Roman Bardet at this year’s Tour, pictured above), or whether he was part of a breakaway that another rider attacked from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One example of the latter is the 2023 Coppa Sabatini in which team tactics played a vital role. Teammate Marc Hirschi attacked from the breakaway that Pogačar was in, so he didn’t try to chase him down and finished third.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same year at the World Championships Road Race, Van der Poel launched a 22km solo attack for victory. It was too far out to be deemed a ‘late attack’ (we’ll get to those), so we’re classing it as a breakaway, and it left Pogačar having to settle for third place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The composition of a breakaway is important in trying to beat Pogačar. You have to either be no danger to the GC fight (like Georg Steinhauser in the Giro), have favourable terrain (like Van der Poel) or just be more powerful at that given point in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter is rare, but again not impossible. After a month off following the World Championships in 2023, Pogačar was back racing in September at the Giro della Toscana. Here he was building up his fitness for Il Lombardia in October, so the race itself wasn’t a main goal, but he was dropped by Ineos Grenadiers’ Pavel Sivakov in the last 29km then passed by Richard Carapaz too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attack him after some time off the bike in a race he isn’t targeting and you might stand a chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When Pogačar was beaten by a breakaway:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stage 13 of the Tour de France, 2023 (3rd)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>UCI Road World Championship Road Race, 2023 (3rd)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Giro della Toscana, 2023 (4th)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Coppa Sabatini, 2023 (3rd)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stage 17 of the Giro d’Italia, 2024 (2nd)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stage 1 of the Tour de France, 2024 (4th)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Late attack (33%)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1509252258-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1509252258-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1509252258-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1509252258-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1509252258-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1509252258-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1509252258-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1509252258-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1509252258-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1509252258-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/GettyImages-1509252258-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Michael Steele/Getty Images</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last two seasons, the most successful way of beating Pogačar has been through a late attack. Of the seven instances, five were won by riders not deemed a threat to Pogačar in a stage race general classification. All came from an attack in the final 10km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several came at the 2023 Tour de France, including Victor Lafay on Stage 2 (pictured above). That wasn’t even the first instance at that race, though. On the opening day in the Basque Country, Simon Yates attacked just after the summit of the day’s final climb and his twin Adam followed. It made sense Pogačar wouldn’t chase the move down in the last 9km given Adam was his teammate and the twins battled for the win, Adam prevailing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another long attack came later in the Tour from Ineos Grenadiers’ Carlos Rodríguez. After some stopping and starting thanks to a TV motorbike, Rodríguez and Adam Yates caught Pogačar and Vingegaard, and the Spaniard jumped clear with 8km remaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Rodríguez was third overall in the standings, he was not seen as a direct threat to the yellow jersey, sitting over four minutes down in the GC. Both Pogačar and Vingegaard were understandably just looking at each other and Yates wasn’t wasting any excess energy for a stage win with one already in the bag given he was required as a domestique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another Milan-San Remo trophy escaped from Pogačar’s grasp with a blistering 5.5km solo attack from Van der Poel. Using the Poggio as a platform like so many have done in the past, the Dutchman gapped the field while behind Pogačar finished off the podium, his efforts on the Poggio depleting his energy levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said after the race, ‘Maybe I was just not strong enough to go solo… Mathieu [van der Poel] was sprinting at the top [of the Poggio]. I was already dead from my turn.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An attack on the San Luca climb at the Giro dell’Emilia went unanswered in 2023 too. The four-man group of Pogačar, Roglič, Carapaz and Enric Mas stuck together like glue and Aleksandr Vlasov, Michael Woods and Simon Yates bridged across in the final kilometre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roglič jumped away in the last 400m and Pogačar tried to answer but couldn’t get on his wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A late attack typically works best against Pogačar when it comes in the final 10km from a rider not deemed a threat in a stage race GC. Or do it in an Italian Classic not called Il Lombardia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When Pogačar was beaten by a late attack:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Milan-San Remo, 2023 (4th) – 5.5km</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stage 1 of the Tour de France, 2023 (3rd) – 9km</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stage 2 of the Tour de France, 2023 (3rd) – 1km</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stage 14 of the Tour de France, 2023 (2nd) (also break from breakaway) – 8km</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Giro dell’Emilia, 2023 (2nd) – Final km</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tre Valli Varesine, 2023 (5th) – 9.5km</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stage 1 of the Volta a Catalunya, 2024 (2nd) – 1.1km</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What about in GCs?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these are based on one-day races or Grand Tour stages, not the overall standings of a stage race. Pogačar was beaten by Vingegaard in the 2023 Tour de France with the third week his undoing. After dropping to 1min 48sec down in the ITT, it was expected that Pogačar would bounce back the next day. The opposite happened and he cracked on the Col de la Loze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He didn’t have the ideal preparation for that edition having fractured his wrist at Liège-Bastogne-Liège earlier in the year, and fuelling was claimed to be his issue on the Col de la Loze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you want to beat Tadej Pogačar, lose time in GC and attack in the final 10km. Failing that, get in the breakaway Thomas De Gendt-style and hope Pogačar doesn’t catch you or, if you’re Jonas Vingegaard, hope he bonks again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-mens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best men’s Grand Tour stages of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-if-tadej-pogacar-didnt-exist\">What if Tadej Pogačar didn’t exist?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pogacar-vs-merckx\">Pogačar vs Merckx: Who had the best season ever?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-does-tadej-pogacar-still-have-to-win\">GOAT Bingo: What does Tadej Pogačar still have left to win?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-beat-tadej-pogacar\">How do you beat Tadej Pogačar?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"ca55bf99767c13696279a66226465551f35a060f7e84cead1f0c5d0364e8a261","category":"Cycling"}
