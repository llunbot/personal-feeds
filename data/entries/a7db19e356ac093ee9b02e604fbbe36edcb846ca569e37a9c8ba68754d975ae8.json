However, the therapy's further potential remains limited given that scientists have yet to fully understand exactly why it works.</p>\n<p>For the trial, 60 patients with tetraplegia underwent the stimulation therapy over at least 24 sessions during a two-month period. At the end, 72 percent (43 patients) saw clinically meaningful improvements in both strength and functional performance. Further, 90 percent (54 patients) saw improvement from at least one strength or functional outcome. There were no serious adverse events reported.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026123#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026123&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a7db19e356ac093ee9b02e604fbbe36edcb846ca569e37a9c8ba68754d975ae8","category":"Tech"}
