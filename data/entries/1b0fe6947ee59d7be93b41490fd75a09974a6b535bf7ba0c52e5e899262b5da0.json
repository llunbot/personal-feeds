The game can no longer hide behind <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/back-4-blood-beta-impressions-a-template-for-potential-co-op-greatness/\">the safe haze of a \"beta test,\"</a> and we'll see how game balance, technical performance, an unlockable card system, and any microtransactions play out in the real world.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802034#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802034&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1b0fe6947ee59d7be93b41490fd75a09974a6b535bf7ba0c52e5e899262b5da0","category":"Tech"}
