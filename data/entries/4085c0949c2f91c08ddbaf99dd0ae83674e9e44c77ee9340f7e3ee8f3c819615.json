A new Canary channel Windows Insider build <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/08/15/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-27868-canary-channel/\">released yesterday</a> fixes a decades-old and arbitrary limitation that restricted new FAT32 partitions to 32GB in size, even though the filesystem itself has a maximum supported size of 2TB (and Windows can read and recognize 2TB FAT32 partitions without an issue).</p>\n<p>For now, this limit is only being lifted for the command-line formatting tools in Windows. The disk formatting UI, which looks more or less the same now as it did when it was introduced in Windows NT 4.0 almost 30 years ago, still has the arbitrary 32GB capacity restriction.</p>\n\n<p>The 32GB limit can allegedly be pinned on former Microsoft programmer Dave Plummer, who occasionally shares stories about his time working on Windows in the 1990s and early 2000s. Plummer <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/windows-current-disk-formatting-ui-is-a-30-year-old-placeholder-from-windows-nt/\">says</a> that he wrote the file format dialog, intending it as a \"temporary\" solution, and arbitrarily chose 32GB as a size limit for disks, likely because it seemed big enough at the time (Windows NT 4.0 required a whopping 110MB of disk space).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043819#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043819&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4085c0949c2f91c08ddbaf99dd0ae83674e9e44c77ee9340f7e3ee8f3c819615","category":"Tech"}
