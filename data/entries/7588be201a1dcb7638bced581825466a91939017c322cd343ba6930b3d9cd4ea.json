While he claims that the render is “not based on any actual or undisclosed Apple product,” Geskin is well-connected in the rumor world, having leaked information about the 2020 iPad Pro, iPhone XS Max, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/BenGeskin/status/872942744947314688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E872942744947314688%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inverse.com%2Farticle%2F33162-benjamin-geskin-interview-apple-iphone-8&amp;xcust=1-1-543848-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">iPhone X</a>. His render is reminiscent of the dual selfie cam on the Galaxy S10+, with a pill-shaped camera cutout that floats near the top of the display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while Samsung’s elongated oval cutout was distracting and added little usefulness to the selfie cam, a centered cutout with the Face ID hardware would be a welcome change to the aging notch.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/galaxy-s10-selfie-camera.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /><figcaption><p>The Galaxy S10+ was the only flagship phone Samsung made with a dual-selfie camera.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Christopher Hebert/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not clear whether Apple would go this route—Geskin himself<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/BenGeskin/status/1177242732550610945&amp;xcust=1-1-543848-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"> previously tweeted about a prototype</a> that hides all of the relevant TrueDepth camera sensors in the top bezel—but it would be a nice tradeoff if it did. The cutout is significantly smaller than even the iPhone 13’s notch and would leave much more space at the top for the status bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are plenty of rumors about Apple adopting an in-display fingerprint scanner for future iPhones, it seems more likely that Apple would use that tech in the iPhone SE. After touting the benefits of Face ID, it would be a strange move for Apple to abandon Face ID on its flagship phones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Geskin’s render would be a good compromise. It would reduce the size of the notch considerably while still retaining Face ID as the biometric authenticator. With a smaller camera cutout, the iPhone 14 would look completely different, with bezels that appear more uniform and an experience that’s even more immersive.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7588be201a1dcb7638bced581825466a91939017c322cd343ba6930b3d9cd4ea","category":"Apple"}
