The win, which was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre_d%27Op%C3%A9ra_Spatial\">widely covered</a> in the press at the time, ignited controversy over the ethics of AI-generated artwork.</p>\n\n<p>\"The Board finds that the Work contains more than a de minimis amount of content generated by artificial intelligence (“AI”), and this content must therefore be disclaimed in an application for registration. Because Mr. Allen is unwilling to disclaim the AI-generated material, the Work cannot be registered as submitted,\" the office <a href=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/byprrqkqxpe/AI%20COPYRIGHT%20REGISTRATION%20decision.pdf\">wrote</a> in its decision.</p>\n<p>In this case, \"disclaim\" refers to the act of formally renouncing or giving up any claim to the ownership or authorship of the AI-generated content in the work. The office is saying that because the work contains a non-negligible (\"more than a de minimis\") amount of content generated by AI, Allen must formally acknowledge that the AI-generated content is not his own creation when applying for registration.
