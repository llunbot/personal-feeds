{"title":"Apple Music’s New $5/Month ‘Voice’ Plan","link":"https://512pixels.net/2021/10/apple-outlines-new-voice-music-plan/","date":1634605506000,"content":"\n<p>This plan struck me as weird when it was announced during the keynote, but it makes sense for the way many people use Apple Music: by just asking Siri to play <em>whatever</em>, where “whatever” is a particular song, a particular artist, or a particular mood. If this is your plan, when you go to the Music app on your devices, the interface will just be Siri suggestions and your listening history.</p>\n\n<p>What more do you get for the regular price of $10/month? Spatial audio (potentially cool, <a href=\"https://lefsetz.com/wordpress/2021/06/11/spatial-audio/\">depending upon</a> how carefully the songs were mastered), lossless audio (borderline pointless), offline mode (downloading songs to your device), custom playlists, lyrics, and music videos. For me, it’d be really weird not to be able to browse an available index of all music (artist → album → song), but a lot of people just ask Siri for <em>whatever</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/#plans\">Spotify doesn’t offer a plan like this</a> (<a href=\"/misc/2021/10/spotify-plans-oct-2021.png\">screenshot</a> for posterity) — but Spotify doesn’t have its own voice-driven hardware. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited/echo\">Amazon Music has a $4/month Echo plan</a> that is very similar, but Amazon’s Echo plan is limited to one single Echo device or Fire TV.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/18/apple-music-voice-plan\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d0d4e0fe23612d09435377a56fc43d52a60f02df7eb1e86117de80e721b53d47","category":"Tech"}
