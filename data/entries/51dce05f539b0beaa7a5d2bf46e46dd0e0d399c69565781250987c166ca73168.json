And the present environment, with harsh temperatures, intense radiation, and a sparse atmosphere, isn’t exactly propitious for life. Despite the red planet’s brutality, lichens that inhabit some of the harshest environments on Earth could possibly survive there.</p>\n<p>Lichens are symbionts, or two organisms that are in a cooperative relationship. There is a fungal component (most are about 90 percent fungus) and a photosynthetic component (algae or cyanobacteria). To see if some species of lichen had what it takes to survive on Mars, a team of researchers led by botanist Kaja Skubała used the Space Research Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences to expose the lichen species <i>Diploschistes muscorum </i>and <i>Cetrarea aculeata</i> to simulate Mars conditions.</p>\n<p>“Our study is the first to demonstrate that the metabolism of the fungal partner in lichen symbiosis was active while being in a Mars-like environment,” the researchers said in a <a href=\"https://imafungus.pensoft.net/article/145477/\">study</a> recently published in IMA Fungus. “X-rays associated with solar flares and SEPs reaching Mars should not affect the potential habitability of lichens on this planet.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/lichens-can-survive-almost-anything-and-some-might-survive-mars/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/lichens-can-survive-almost-anything-and-some-might-survive-mars/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"51dce05f539b0beaa7a5d2bf46e46dd0e0d399c69565781250987c166ca73168","category":"Tech"}
