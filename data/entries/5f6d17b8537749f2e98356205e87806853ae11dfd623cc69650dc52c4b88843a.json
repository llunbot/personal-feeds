Being a part of\nApple for 25 years has been the privilege and experience of a\nlifetime.</p>\n\n<p>My last day at Apple was exactly a week ago today. I’d always\ndreamed of being a part of Apple but never imagined it would be a\nreality. The most productive and exciting years of my career have\nbeen with Apple, and I’ll be forever grateful for the opportunity\nto meet and work with thousands of creative and passionate\ndevelopers, designers, and students worldwide. [...]</p>\n\n<p>There are no words to describe how grateful I am for the\nopportunity to work side-by-side with so many great people at\nApple. Apple is an immensely special place — far greater than the\nsum of its parts. Together, we did a lot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I heard about Geleynse’s retirement through the grapevine a month or two ago. I was hoping he’d post something like this publicly, so I could link to it. It’s a lovely departing message.</p>\n\n<p>Turns out, in all the years I’ve been writing here, I’ve only mentioned Geleynse by name twice, and both times I was quoting what someone else had written. And those two posts were from <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/06/21/alldritt\">2007</a> and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2008/12/bang\">2008</a> — a while ago, to say the least. That’s a shame, dare I say negligent on my part. In third-party developer circles, everyone knows John Geleynse. Most prominently, his role as co-host (with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shaanpruden_senior-director-evangelism-careers-at-activity-7260775399645687808-AZee/\">Shaan Pruden</a>) and I think effectively co-chief of the Apple Design Awards. But the ADAs are a once-per-year award show. Year-round, year after year, platform after platform, Geleynse has been shaping, guiding, and defining what it means to be a third-party developer for Apple platforms. The point of winning an ADA isn’t to win an ADA; it’s to reward making a great app that moves the state of the art forward. That’s what Geleynse spent his career trying to do. He’s just incredibly well-liked and well-respected.</p>\n\n<p>But, like a typical “bleed six colors” Apple employee, I think Geleynse going all these years operating mostly behind the scenes, with his own name out of the story, taking no personal credit, is just the way he wanted it. He’s going to be missed, dearly — both inside Apple, and out.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/11/geleynse-retires\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5f6d17b8537749f2e98356205e87806853ae11dfd623cc69650dc52c4b88843a","category":"Tech"}
