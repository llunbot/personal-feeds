There's a ton of information in the $3.5 trillion plan, but today, we're interested in a small portion of the <a href=\"https://waysandmeans.house.gov/sites/democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/files/documents/SUBFGHJ_xml.pdf\">645-page</a> \"Budget Reconciliation Legislative Recommendations Relating to Infrastructure Financing, Green Energy, Social Safety Net, and Prescription Drug Pricing\" section—specifically the parts that deal with incentives to decarbonize our vehicle fleet.</p>\n<p>Beginning in 2010, the Federal government has incentivized people to buy or lease new plug-in vehicles by <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/businesses/irc-30d-new-qualified-plug-in-electric-drive-motor-vehicle-credit\">offering them a tax credit</a>. The credit is based on battery size, starting at $2,917 for a vehicle with a 5 kWh battery and providing an additional $417 per extra kWh, topping out at $7,500. However, the credit only applies to the first 200,000 plug-ins sold by an OEM, at which point the credit begins to expire. To date, only Tesla and General Motors have sold enough plug-in vehicles to see their credits sunset.</p>\n<p>If the budget reconciliation bill passes as is, the current tax credit (known as 30D) goes away, to be replaced by several new purchasing incentives for greener, more efficient vehicles.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794034#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794034&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
