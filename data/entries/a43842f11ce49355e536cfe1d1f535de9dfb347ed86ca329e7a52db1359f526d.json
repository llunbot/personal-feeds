Over the next two days, the searing pain crept up her legs. Any light touch made it worse, and over-the-counter pain medicine offered no relief.</p>\n<p>On the third day, the 30-year-old, otherwise healthy woman from New England went to an emergency department. Her exam was normal. Her blood tests and kidney function were normal. The only thing that stood out was a high number of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003649.htm\">eosinophils</a>—white blood cells that become active with certain allergic diseases, parasitic infections, or other medical conditions, such as cancer.

She developed a headache that was also unfazed by over-the-counter pain medicine. Seven days into the illness, she went to a second emergency department.
