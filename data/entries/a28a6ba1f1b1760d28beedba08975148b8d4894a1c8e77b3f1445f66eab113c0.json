At first glance, it doesn’t look all that different from the other bikes in the Ridley gravel family. But, by combining race-ready aerodynamics in a lighter frame with clearance for up to 52mm tires, this new Astr RS just became the perfect choice for anyone looking to go faster off-road.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ridley Astr RS lightweight aero carbon gravel race bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Ridley Astr RS lightweight aero carbon gravel race bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo/Cory Benson)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ridley already had a bunch of gravel bikes in their lineup – the full-aero Kanzo Fast, the bikepacking-ready Kanzo Adventure, and the light gravel Grifn… with affordable alloy versions of those couple, too. They’ve been building gravel bikes since <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pc15-sneak-peek-at-ridleys-all-road-x-project-plus-debut-of-racy-fenix-sl/\" target=\"_blank\">2015</a>/<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/eb16-ridley-rolls-out-lighter-stiffer-helium-slx-and-fenix-sl-disc-more/\" target=\"_blank\">2016</a>, and even evolving this type of mixed-surface riding &amp; racing on cyclocross bikes since the brand debuted in 2000. So why did they need an all-new gravel race bike?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it seems gravel racing keeps getting gnarlier. And the pro riders on the Classified Ridley Factory Team simply demanded fatter tires to take on those rougher courses. They already had a Kanzo Adv, but they wanted aerodynamics on par with the Kanzo Fast. So it looks like what Ridley actually did was the same thing that made their latest Grifn RS light-gravel all-road race bike. They mashed up the light &amp; sleek features of their Falcn RS aero road bike. And gave it the mega tire clearance of the Adv.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, this new Astr combines those fastest and most versatile features to create one new top-tier gravel race bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_angled-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_angled-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Ridley Astr RS lightweight aero carbon gravel race bike, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_angled-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_angled-297x248.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_angled-1536x1280.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_angled-120x100.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_angled-768x640.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Ridley)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What really sets this new Astr RS apart are three features. Lightweight, aerodynamics, and big tire clearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Light comes down to a top-tier ultralight carbon layup that comes in at a claimed 890g for the medium Astr RS frame. That’s a whopping claimed 369g savings over the Kanzo Fast!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_aero-tube-sections-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_aero-tube-sections-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ridley Astr RS lightweight aero carbon gravel race bike, aero tube sections\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_aero-tube-sections-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_aero-tube-sections-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_aero-tube-sections-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_aero-tube-sections-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Aerodynamics is adapted from Ridley road race bikes with aero tube sections throughout, a wide fork crown that transitions into wind diffuser fins on the downtube, dropped seatstays, an aero seatpost, and a rear wheel cutout.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_big-52mm-tire-clearance-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_big-52mm-tire-clearance-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ridley Astr RS lightweight aero carbon gravel race bike, 52mm tire clearance\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_big-52mm-tire-clearance-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_big-52mm-tire-clearance-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_big-52mm-tire-clearance-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_big-52mm-tire-clearance-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_big-52mm-tire-clearance-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest deal probably though is the mega tire clearance on the new Astr. Ridley says there is room for up to 52mm tires with a single chainring setup, or up to 47mm with a 2x crank and space for the front derailleur cage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gravel Race Geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geo-tweaks-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geo-tweaks-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ridley Astr RS lightweight aero carbon gravel race bike, geometry comparison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geo-tweaks-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geo-tweaks-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geo-tweaks-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geo-tweaks-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geo-tweaks-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geo-tweaks-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geo-tweaks-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fat tires apparently don’t have to mean slow handling geometry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining big tires, 2x, and aerodynamics was the real trick to keep the race-ready handling feel. Ridley managed to keep the same short 425mm chainstays as the Kanzo Fast, as well as the same 71.5° headtube angle. Plus, there’s the steeper 74° seat tube and slightly lower bottom bracket inherited from the Adv to compensate for the taller ride height of the larger volume tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Ridley Astr RS lightweight aero carbon gravel race bike, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight balance is a shade higher than the Fast… +3.5-5mm for taller tires, then -2mm from the extra BB drop. But Ridley also shortened headtube heights and managed to bring frame Stack down a bit for a bit more weight on the front wheel and a more aerodynamic position on the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech

And then, when race day comes around you pin a number on and see how fast you can hammer it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A more affordable carbon Astr, too</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_up-close-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_up-close-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ridley Astr affordable aero carbon gravel race bike, detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_up-close-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_up-close-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_up-close-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_up-close-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_up-close-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_up-close-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_up-close-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Ridley)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Accompanying the new Astr RS is a more affordable carbon Ridley Astr, too.

And at the same time you add full 1x/2x mechanical compatibility, and also get the added benefit of a regular 27.2mm round seatpost. Sure, it’s marginally less aero, but more comfortable and versatile.

Order now and Ridley says you should receive the bike by the end of the month in most markets. And if you want to try one out now, Ridley has a test fleet of the new Astr RS gravel race bikes on hand at the UCI Gravel World Championships in Leuven, Belgium this weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like pretty much all of their bikes, there are tons of options for customizing the new Ridley Astr RS, via their online configurator. Pick the design scheme you want, your favorite colors, and your ideal component spec. The Taiwanese-made carbon frames are painted-to-order and then assembled in Europe just how you want it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Ridley Astr RS lightweight aero carbon gravel race bike, frameset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_frameset-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>New Ridley Astr RS framesets start at 5000€ for frame, fork &amp; aero seatpost in the team replica paint job in the color of your choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Force-AXS-green-build-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Force-AXS-green-build-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Ridley Astr RS lightweight aero carbon gravel race bike, SRAM Force XPLR AXS\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Force-AXS-green-build-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Force-AXS-green-build-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Force-AXS-green-build-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Force-AXS-green-build-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_SRAM-Force-AXS-green-build-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Complete Astr RS bike builds start at 7300€ with either a Shimano GRX Di2 2×12 or SRAM Force Xplr 1×12 groupset, a Ridley brand 4ZA Nimbus Pro integrated carbon cockpit, and carbon DT Swiss GRC1600 aero gravel wheels. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_fast-and-loose-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_fast-and-loose-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Ridley Astr RS lightweight aero carbon gravel race bike, Red XPLR AXS riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_fast-and-loose-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_fast-and-loose-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_fast-and-loose-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_fast-and-loose-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ridley-Astr-RS-lightweight-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_fast-and-loose-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo/Cory Benson)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the top-spec build sells for 11,700€ with a new SRAM Red Xplr 1x 13-speed build kit and DT GRC1400 wheels with more premium hubs.
