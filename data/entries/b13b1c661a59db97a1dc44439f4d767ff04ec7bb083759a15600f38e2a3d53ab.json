The TYT is a nationally held university aptitude exam that determines a person's eligibility to attend a university in Turkeyâ€”and cheating on the high-stakes exam is a serious offense.</p>\n<p>According to police reports, the student used a camera disguised as a shirt button, connected to AI software via a \"router\" (possibly a mistranslation of a cellular modem) hidden in the sole of their shoe. The system worked by scanning the exam questions using the button camera, which then relayed the information to an unnamed AI model. The software generated the correct answers and recited them to the student through an earpiece.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031012#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031012&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b13b1c661a59db97a1dc44439f4d767ff04ec7bb083759a15600f38e2a3d53ab","category":"Tech"}
