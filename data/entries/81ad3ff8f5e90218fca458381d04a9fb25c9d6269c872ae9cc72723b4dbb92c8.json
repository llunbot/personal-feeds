With the chain routed over the main pivot, the influence of the rear suspension is largely removed from the drivetrain, giving a much smoother ride in the rough.</p>\n<p>High pivot, idler-based suspension linkages are becoming more and more popular on the enduro scene, with bikes from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-cannondale-jekyll/\" target=\"_blank\">Cannondale</a> (which is owned by the same group as GT), <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/deviate-highlander-review/\">Deviate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/forbidden-dreadnought-xt-review/\">Forbidden</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-norco-range/\">Norco</a> among the ranks of manufacturers routing their chains the long way round.</p>\n<p>It’s an idea that originated in downhill, where smoothness over big hits is of utmost importance, and is starting to make its way down the travel ranks.</p>\n<h2>Bang on-trend geometry updates</h2>\n<p>The full carbon frame has a longer reach than its predecessor, which GT says provides optimal steering when paired with the shorter stem.</p>\n<p>The frame now has a steeper 78-degree seat-tube angle to improve climbing performance and a slacker 63.5-degree head tube angle for greater stability on descents.</p>\n<p>The rear end is longer than its predecessor and with its lower standover height, when paired with that slacker front end, now falls in line with the current trends of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">best enduro mountain bikes</a> that prioritise descending stability and speed.</p>\n<p>The previous Force was available with 27.5in wheels, but the new version gets 29in wheels. GT says that in real-world testing these larger wheels proved best at maximising performance.</p>\n<p>The rear triangle has a flip-chip that allows you to adjust the chainstay length between 435mm and 445mm, giving you a longer wheelbase for more stability on rough descents.</p>\n<h3>2022 GT Force Geometry (Large)</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>Reach:</strong> 480mm</li>\n<li><strong>Top tube horizontal:</strong> 617mm</li>\n<li><strong>Seat tube length:</strong> 445mm</li>\n<li><strong>Head tube length:</strong> 130mm</li>\n<li><strong>Head tube angle:</strong> 63.5 degrees</li>\n<li><strong>Seat tube angle:</strong> 78 degrees</li>\n<li><strong>Chainstay length:</strong> 435mm / 445mm</li>\n<li><strong>Wheelbase:</strong> 1,270mm/ 12,80mm</li>\n</ul><h2>Force suspension</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The four-bar LTS suspension system is said to increase the Force’s anti-squat and anti-rise figures.</span></figcaption><span> <i>GT</i></span></div>\n<p>GT has increased the anti-squat on the Force which it claims should improve acceleration, while anti-rise has been increased from 60 per cent to 70 per cent for controlled braking and less dive at high speeds.</p>\n<p>The shock’s stroke has seen increases too, from 55mm to 65mm, to lower the leverage ratio of the bike and, as GT says, “improve ‘pump-ability’”.
