F1 Arcade capitalizes on that popularity, combining food and drinks—including Lewis Hamilton's agave tipple—with dozens and dozens of race simulators that let you race against friends or compete in teams against others.</p>\n<p>With Washington, DC, chosen for F1 Arcade's second US location, I obviously had to go check it out.</p>\n<p>My first visit to the arcade in DC's Union Market district was several weeks ago at the launch party, an affair that was packed with influencers and loud music. But I returned earlier this week, having booked a 45-minute, five-race session playing head-to-head against a friend. Prices vary depending on the number of races and whether you're that at peak time, starting at $22/player for three races off-peak and going up to $42/player for five races at peak time. There's no charge for people who are just spectating (or eating and drinking), not racing.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2024/12/f1-arcade-trip-report-great-sims-make-for-a-compelling-experience/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2024/12/f1-arcade-trip-report-great-sims-make-for-a-compelling-experience/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
