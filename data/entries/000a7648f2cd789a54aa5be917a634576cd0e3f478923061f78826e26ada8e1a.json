{"title":"From Biocrust, With Love: Shred Lightly Principles and Story – Dr. Kristina Young & John Watson","link":"https://theradavist.com/from-biocrust-with-love/","date":1714474810000,"content":"<p><em>To the untrained eye, the desert may appear inhospitable. But, just because the desert poses a harsh environment to humans, doesn’t mean that it’s devoid of life. Far from it, in fact. For the past year, John has been working on a documentary about desert ecology on the Colorado Plateau with filmmaker <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sinuhexavier/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Sinuhe Xavier</a> and dryland ecologist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/krstina.young/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Kristina Young</a>. Today, we’re elated to announce the premiere of  “From Biocrust, With Love,” a video project that brings the desert floor into microscopic relief and reminds us of the importance of Shredding Lightly…</em><br />\n<span></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span>﻿</span><span><span></span></span><span></span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I love riding bikes on day rides and bike camping, backpacking, and touring four-wheel drives throughout the Colorado Plateau. Ever since I was a teenager, I’d pine over the other-worldly landscapes and obsessed over the animals that call the deserts of the American West their home.</p>\n<p>This led me to read various desert-minded authors, most notably the work of Craig Childs, who opened my eyes through his anecdotal accounts of how dynamic these landscapes are, down to the microscopic level. From there, a lifetime of traveling through these places on foot and wheels brought about an immense appreciation for dry and arid landscapes.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-95.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-95.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-95.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-95.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-95.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Yet, with a surge in outdoor recreation during and after the pandemic, I noticed more damage from the misuse and overuse of these delicate ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Through my love of this region, I felt as if this deep gravitas brought me into orbit with other like-minded photographers and filmmakers, one of whom is Sinuhe Xavier. One day, we were lamenting the current state of the Moab region when he told me about his friend Kristina, who studies cryptobiotic soil crusts.</p>\n<p>We met up over Gilberto’s burritos and discussed what a science film could look like in the modern age of cinematography. These conversations prompted Sinuhe and I to spearhead this film project, a visual tribute that briefly introduces the work of dryland ecologist and founder of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sciencemoab/\" target=\"_blank\">Science Moab</a>, Dr. Kristina Young.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-37.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-37.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-37.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-37.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-37.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-26.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-26.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-26.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-26.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/04/From-Biocrust-With-Love-26.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Our first production date was skunked due to a freak storm blanketing the region in snow.

Nothing is further from the truth. Dry places are full of life; you just have to know where to look for it… One of the most interesting places to look is right at the soil surface.
