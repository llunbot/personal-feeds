As previously shared on June 13, we have\nadjusted our release approach to leverage the valuable expertise\nof our Windows Insider community prior to making Recall available\nfor all Copilot+ PCs. Security continues to be our top priority\nand when Recall is available for Windows Insiders in October we\nwill publish a blog with more details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For years I stubbornly held onto the full word <em>weblog</em>, but eventually <em>blog</em> won out. But that’s talking about a blog as a publication, a site. It will never sound anything but idiotic to me to call a blog post a “blog”. It makes no sense. You write blogs on a blog?</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, would be scary to consider what this Recall feature would have been like if security were not, as Microsoft repeats <em>ad nauseum</em>, the company’s top priority. The initial version <a href=\"https://doublepulsar.com/recall-stealing-everything-youve-ever-typed-or-viewed-on-your-own-windows-pc-is-now-possible-da3e12e9465e\">was such privacy Swiss cheese</a> that it’s enough to make you think Microsoft is <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/22/windows_crowdstrike_kernel_eu/\">full of shit</a> that security is their top priority.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/21/windows-recall-october\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"37457dd0e6c7279a4fc7f7dc51a690928f9738eb8e02ced01ce2fd83a1baee09","category":"Tech"}
