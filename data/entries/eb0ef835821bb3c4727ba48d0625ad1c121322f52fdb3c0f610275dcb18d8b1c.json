Apple says the feature can reduce your carbon footprint by selectively charging when lower carbon-emission electricity is available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a new document, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/\">Aaron Perris</a>, Apple said the Clean Energy Charging feature will be enabled by default on all iPhone and iPad demo units in U.S. stores, reducing the carbon footprint of those devices. To ensure that the demo units are always ready to be used by customers, Apple said devices will resume charging immediately in the event that they drop below 50% battery life.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nClean Energy Charging is enabled by default for customers too. On iOS 16.1 and later, the feature can be managed in the Settings app, under Battery â†’ Battery Health &amp; Charging. The feature is still available in the contiguous United States only.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/clean-energy-charging-ios-16-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nIt is unclear exactly when the feature will be enabled on iPhone and iPad demo units.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is just one of several <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-announces-major-reduction-in-gas-emissions/\">environmental initiatives and milestones</a> that Apple has announced ahead of Earth Day on April 22.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/108068\">support document</a> with more details about Clean Energy Charging.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/demo-iphones-ipads-clean-energy-charging/\">Apple to Enable Clean Energy Charging on iPhone Demo Units</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-enable-clean-energy-charging-on-iphone-demo-units.2455459/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eb0ef835821bb3c4727ba48d0625ad1c121322f52fdb3c0f610275dcb18d8b1c","category":"Apple"}
