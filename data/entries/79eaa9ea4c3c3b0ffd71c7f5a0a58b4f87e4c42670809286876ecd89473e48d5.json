Since a refurbished Mac is a machine that a customer returned, all the Mac Pros in Apple’s refurbished inventory are ones that a customer designed. You can’t customize a refurb, so you basically have to pick what’s on the shelf. If you really want a refurb Mac Pro, you may have to settle for a model that doesn’t quite fit the specifications you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, big savings could be had. We’ve seen models for sale that were over $1,000 cheaper than a brand new model. If you are planning to spend big bucks, it’s at least worth a few minutes checking out the inventory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished&amp;subid1=1-1-230729-1-0-0\">Go to the Apple Certified Refurbished store to see all of the available Mac Pros for sale.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Refurbished Apple TV</h2>\n\n\n<div><div><figure><img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/11/apple-tv-100741667-small.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /></figure></div></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>As of this writing, Apple has only the older model with the old remote control, not he latest model with the Siri remote.

Apple repairs and tests these products to make sure they are in like-new condition. The Apple store, however, sells only new products that have <em>never</em> been opened and used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strangely, finding the Apple Certified Refurbished store isn’t obvious. On Apple.com, scroll to the very bottom of the page, where you’ll find a site directory. Under Apple Store, you’ll find a link for <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished&amp;subid1=1-1-230729-1-0-0\">Refurbished and Clearance</a>. (This link takes you there.)</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/11/apple-product-family-2017-100742618-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>What does “Certified Refurbished” mean?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The items in the Apple Certified Refurbished store are products that have been purchased and returned by other customers. Apple puts these products through what they call a “stringent refurbishment process” before they are put on the virtual shelves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple says that each product is thoroughly tested and any problematic hardware components are replaced. The exception is with the Apple Watch and Apple Pencil: If these items need new parts, they aren’t put up for sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each product goes through a quality assurance inspection, and is also cleaned, inspected, and repackaged with complete documentation, cables, and anything else that usually ships with that device. These products are essentially like new.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/09/applecare-logo-2017-100736420-medium.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>What kind of warranty comes with an Apple Certified Refurbished product?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple includes a standard one-year limited warranty. <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/&amp;subid1=1-1-230729-1-0-0\">Learn more about Apple’s hardware warranties</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is AppleCare available for Apple Certified Refurbished products?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AppleCare is available. For an additional fee, you can get two or three years of coverage and support. Read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230521/applecare-warranty-faq.html\">guide to AppleCare</a> for more information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What products are available?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since these are refurbished products, inventory for this store relies on what’s returned to Apple. Because of this, it’s quite possible the store won’t have the model that you want. Apple may not have a certain model of a product one day, and the next day they might all of a sudden have a limited stock run available, unannounced. Then, once that batch sells out, it will once again become unavailable until Apple builds up stock again.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/11/apple-macs-family-2017-100742624-medium.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Certified Refurbished store carries all of the company’s major product lines: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apple.co/2AMISH5&amp;xcust=1-1-230729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Macs</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apple.co/2QZTnMQ&amp;xcust=1-1-230729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">iPhones</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apple.co/2DgOtas&amp;xcust=1-1-230729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">iPads</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apple.co/2sx7aQU&amp;xcust=1-1-230729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Watches</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apple.co/2Dh4wF2&amp;xcust=1-1-230729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">HomePods</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apple.co/2ASrWiw&amp;xcust=1-1-230729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">iPods</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apple.co/2W32GiP&amp;xcust=1-1-230729-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple TVs</a>.

Apple often sells older models. You can find refurbished models of the current product line, but these items tend to sell quickly, so act fast.</p>\n</div>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"79eaa9ea4c3c3b0ffd71c7f5a0a58b4f87e4c42670809286876ecd89473e48d5","category":"Apple"}
