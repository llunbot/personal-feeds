The most recent estimate is that it costs $2.2 billion to build a single SLS rocket, and this does not include add-ons such as ground systems, integration, a payload, and more.</p>\n<p>Broadly speaking, NASA's cost-reduction plan is to transfer responsibility for production of the rocket to a new company co-owned by Boeing and Northrop Grumman, which are key contractors for the rocket. This company, \"Deep Space Transport,\" would then build the rockets and sell them to NASA. The space agency has said that this services-based model could reduce the cost of the rocket by as much as 50 percent.</p>\n<p>However, in <a href=\"https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-24-001.pdf\">a damning new report</a>, NASA's inspector general, Paul Martin, says that is not going to happen. Rather, Martin writes, the cost of building the rocket is actually likely to increase.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975835#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975835&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"60394b73d32939e7558d72cab03515a1e9dd95ce8f7ffaa99c75fa4a934d6bf5","category":"Tech"}
