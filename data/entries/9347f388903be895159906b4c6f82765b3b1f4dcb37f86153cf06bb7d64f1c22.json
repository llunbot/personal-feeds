Remove one more cable from your cockpit with a smooth dropper that’s lighter &amp; cheaper than AXS. Plus, get the option for longer dropper travel and rider-adjustable return. We’ve been riding the smooth new wireless KS LEV Circuit dropper, and don’t want to go back to cables…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>KS LEV Circuit wireless mountain bike dropper seatpost</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-head-kinda.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-head-kinda.jpg\" alt=\"KS LEV Circuit wireless dropper seatpost, electronic mountain bike dropper post, pseudo 1-bolt head\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-head-kinda.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-head-kinda-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-head-kinda-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-head-kinda-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-head-kinda-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-head-kinda-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another wireless dropper means more options and better performance. So we were pretty psyched to hear the trusted KS LEV going wireless with this new Circuit. When we had first gotten our grubby fingers on a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/eb15-magura-syncs-up-new-wireless-electronic-vyron-dropper-post/\" target=\"_blank\">Magura Vyron</a> dropper over eight years ago, it was a very promising idea, but the speed and actuation left much to be desired. Several wireless droppers later, and the new KS LEV Circuit is a real option for ditching cables…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_R-lightning-bolt-for-ciRcuit.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_R-lightning-bolt-for-ciRcuit.jpg\" alt=\"KS LEV Circuit wireless dropper seatpost, electronic mountain bike dropper post, LEV R lightning bolt logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_R-lightning-bolt-for-ciRcuit.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_R-lightning-bolt-for-ciRcuit-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_R-lightning-bolt-for-ciRcuit-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_R-lightning-bolt-for-ciRcuit-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_R-lightning-bolt-for-ciRcuit-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_R-lightning-bolt-for-ciRcuit-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been spying wireless KS droppers since all the way <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tpe15-ks-zeta-dropper-seatpost-for-road-bikes-plus-prototype-wireless-dropper-post/\" target=\"_blank\">back in 2015</a>, and got a proper look at this new LEV Circuit wireless dropper <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ks-gravel-suspension-fork-emtb-fork-wireless-dropper-seatpost/\" target=\"_blank\">already last March</a>. It started out with the proven reliable internals of KS’s popular LEV series of MTB droppers, but then got completely revamped in its wireless overhaul. KS gave the LEV Circuit a revised internal hydraulic circuit layout, with its hydraulic valve at the top of the post to allow for top-down control.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_bluetooth-remote-control-actuator.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_bluetooth-remote-control-actuator.jpg\" alt=\"KS LEV Circuit wireless dropper seatpost, electronic mountain bike dropper post, remote\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_bluetooth-remote-control-actuator.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_bluetooth-remote-control-actuator-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_bluetooth-remote-control-actuator-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_bluetooth-remote-control-actuator-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_bluetooth-remote-control-actuator-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_bluetooth-remote-control-actuator-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_bluetooth-remote-control-actuator-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bluetooth controls the new LEV Circuit, actuated by a relatively bulky but lightweight remote. It has a super short throw button though, moving just 0.5mm to actuate. It’s a smooth press with no perceivable resistance, and it’s fast to drop. Of the handful of wireless droppers I’ve tried, I can’t remember any being so quick or so easy to drop to whatever height I want!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dropper also has an adjustable air return spring to let you tune its speed (100-180psi). At the bottom of the post, a classic Schrader valve lets you pick the pressure you want for either a smooth-controlled or rocket-fast return. And since it’s wireless, there’s no stress to pop the dropper out of your bike and change the air pressure inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-universal-saddle-clamp-head.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-universal-saddle-clamp-head.jpg\" alt=\"KS LEV Circuit wireless dropper seatpost, electronic mountain bike dropper post, universal saddle fit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-universal-saddle-clamp-head.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-universal-saddle-clamp-head-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-universal-saddle-clamp-head-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-universal-saddle-clamp-head-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-universal-saddle-clamp-head-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-universal-saddle-clamp-head-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_1-bolt-universal-saddle-clamp-head-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The post’s head features a new sliding 1-bolt clamp for KS that is compatible with both standard round or oval rails (6x7mm or 7x9mm).

It really is just smoother and easier to actuate than any mechanical dropper I have on other bikes. And I’ve been quite impressed with the speed of the wireless electronic remote, compared to previous Vyron, AXS &amp; TranzX droppers. I’ve had no trouble quickly dropping part of the way down. And I like being able to dial-in a relatively slower and smoother return (at 150psi for me) for when I want the post back up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve actually put the dropper in a couple of bikes so far. And the biggest trouble was actually having to go back to a wired dropper on the first bike, after I pulled the LEV Circuit wireless dropper out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_dimensions-drawing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_dimensions-drawing.jpg\" alt=\"KS LEV Circuit wireless dropper seatpost, electronic mountain bike dropper post, tech dimensions\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_dimensions-drawing.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_dimensions-drawing-297x134.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_dimensions-drawing-800x360.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_dimensions-drawing-120x54.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_dimensions-drawing-768x346.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_dimensions-drawing-1536x691.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The LEV Circuit dropper is powered by a 450mWh removable battery in the head of the seatpost. A secure plastic clip holds it in place, then slide it back to get out, and recharge with the proprietary USB-C charger included. KS claims up to 55 hours of operation on a single charge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>No idea yet how many drops or how many rides you’ll get with that in the real world though. But we’ve been using it for a few weeks and the LED is still flashing green with each drop. A solid red LED warns of &lt;30% battery remaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_removable-rechargeable-battery.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_removable-rechargeable-battery.jpg\" alt=\"KS LEV Circuit wireless dropper seatpost, electronic mountain bike dropper post, removable battery\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_removable-rechargeable-battery.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_removable-rechargeable-battery-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_removable-rechargeable-battery-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_removable-rechargeable-battery-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_removable-rechargeable-battery-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_removable-rechargeable-battery-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_removable-rechargeable-battery-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A standard CR2032 coin cell battery powers the remote controller. And KS claims it will need replacement approximately every 8 months. The remote features a 2-position Matchmaker mount, and comes with a split band clamp if you run Shimano brakes like I do. You can always get an I-spec adapter to fit, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole setup is IP67 rated. That makes it dust-proof and water-resistant. That should survive mountain biking in any conditions. But it is electronic, so probably don’t hit the remote or dropper head with a pressure washer, please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dropper slides on three precise keyways for virtually no side-to-side-play. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_655g-actual-weight-31-6x150mm.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_655g-actual-weight-31-6x150mm.jpg\" alt=\"KS LEV Circuit wireless dropper seatpost, electronic mountain bike dropper post, 655g actual 31.6 x 150mm dropper weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_655g-actual-weight-31-6x150mm.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_655g-actual-weight-31-6x150mm-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_655g-actual-weight-31-6x150mm-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_655g-actual-weight-31-6x150mm-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_655g-actual-weight-31-6x150mm-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_655g-actual-weight-31-6x150mm-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_655g-actual-weight-31-6x150mm-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Claimed weight is as little as 588g for the 30.9 x 125mm dropper.

So this new KS one is just 30g lighter, but also more than a hundred and fifty bucks cheaper, now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>KS LEV Circuit wireless – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_on-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_on-bike.jpg\" alt=\"KS LEV Circuit wireless dropper seatpost, electronic mountain bike dropper post, on bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_on-bike.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_on-bike-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_on-bike-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_on-bike-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_on-bike-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KS-LEV-Circuit-wireless-dropper-seatpost_electronic-mountain-bike-dropper-post_on-bike-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new KS LEV Circuit wireless dropper is available from today for $699 in a number of different sizes. Surely, that’s not exactly cheap. But, it’s at least a bit more affordable than a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rockshox-reverb-axs-wireless-dropper-seatpost-complete-technical-overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Reverb AXS</a> dropper. And it still comes with the trust of the KS brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wireless <a href=\"https://kssuspension.com/products/dropper-seat-posts/lev-circuit/\" target=\"_blank\">KS LEV Circuit</a> dropper post comes in either 30.9mm or 31.6mm diameters. And you can pick from 125mm, 150mm, 175mm, and long 200mm of dropper travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://kssuspension.com/\">KSsuspension.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-rides-ks-lev-circuit-wireless-dropper-post-drops-it-quick-easy/\">First Rides: KS LEV Circuit Wireless Dropper Post Drops It Quick &amp; Easy</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"9347f388903be895159906b4c6f82765b3b1f4dcb37f86153cf06bb7d64f1c22","category":"Cycling"}
