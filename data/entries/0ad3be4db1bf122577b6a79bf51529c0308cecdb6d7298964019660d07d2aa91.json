According to Lau, foldable smartphones have yet to become a mainstream hit due to many factors, including concerns over durability, software utilization, and more, and that Oppo wanted to change that.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Although a handful of other brands have already introduced foldable devices to the market, barriers such as utility, durability and user experience continue to prevent foldable devices from becoming a more feasible daily driver for most people. So when I returned to OPPO last year, I was excited to take over this major project and guide the team to overcome the final hurdles to turn this dream into reality.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith the Find N, we have solved the main pain points in previous foldable smartphones, such as the crease in the display and overall durability of the device, by inventing perhaps the best hinge and display designs available today. We look forward to truly pushing the folding screen experience forward.</blockquote>Lau added that beyond 5G, faster charging, higher refresh rates, improved cameras, and more, \"smartphone development has reached a limit\" and that \"new ways of thinking and new approaches to continue innovating\" are needed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>This is the exquisitely engineered <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOFindN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#OPPOFindN</a>. <br />Hold.
