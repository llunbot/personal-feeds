Paqui sold the chip with a challenge in which eaters were dared to consume the chip, wait as long as possible before eating or drinking anything, and post the aftermath on social media, where the challenge went viral.</p>\n<p>Harris' mother, Lois Wolobah, immediately suspected the chip was involved in his untimely death. At the time, she reportedly said she picked him up from school after getting a call from the nurse. He was clutching his stomach and, about two hours later, lost consciousness and was rushed to the hospital, where he died. She reported that he had no known medical conditions at the time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025060#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025060&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f6c54d347e80f59e678ed8d692ba5a0bed7af98b9bc43a4efa938fc989160ed7","category":"Tech"}
