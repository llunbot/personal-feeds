That’s pretty much what augmented reality (AR) glasses company Nreal is going for with the Nreal Air announced today. With a light, 2.72 ounce (77 g) weight and micro-OLED display, the Nreal Air is just what you need to finally watch <em>Parks and Recreation</em> in an actual park.</p>\n<p>Since Nreal released the <a href=\"https://www.nreal.ai/light\">Nreal Light </a>in 2019, AR tech has evolved so hardware offerings can be smaller. The Nreal Air is 27 percent lighter than the Nreal Light (3.74 ounces/106 g), although it also comes with less functionality. There’s no handtracking or spatial awareness, so you can’t interact with what you see. Instead, you’ll have to rely on an app on your smartphone, which must be tethered to the Nreal Air for it to work (as is the case with the Nreal Light).</p>\n<p>This is because the Nreal Air isn’t about dragging and dropping furniture around your virtual home or trying on outfits via a virtual avatar before buying, or other, more interactive AR applications. Instead, Nreal is targeting the Nreal Air primarily at watching videos on YouTube and other streaming apps.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799636#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799636&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"13bc797d4f09c7e4ea71070d95d65020aa9d6d689fe8f1eed0199af7c92a2120","category":"Tech"}
