Just like on the Mac Studio, it is a front-facing slot.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThird, the hub includes an NVMe enclosure that allows you to add an SSD with up to 4TB of storage to the Mac mini. This can both expand the Mac mini's storage and allow you to avoid Apple's expensive storage upgrade prices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe hub is made out of aluminum and looks similar to the Mac mini. Satechi ensures that the hub will not impact airflow or Wi-Fi connectivity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSatechi has yet to announce pricing for the hub, and availability in the U.S. does not begin until spring 2025. In an email, a spokesperson said there will also be a version of the hub without an NVMe enclosure. According to the <a href=\"https://satechi.net/landing/new-stand-and-hub-m4-mac-mini\">product page</a>, those who sign up for email updates will receive 20% off the price of the hub when it is released.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/satechi/\">Satechi</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/21/satechi-previews-m4-mac-mini-hub/\">Satechi Previews Mac Mini Hub With SD Card Slot, Three USB-A Ports, and Up to 4TB Storage Slot</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/satechi-previews-mac-mini-hub-with-sd-card-slot-three-usb-a-ports-and-up-to-4tb-storage-slot.2443644/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b021b43c614da1a4cc37ae8e6747199d11bd31908a4e1804194b70858b08dd89","category":"Apple"}
