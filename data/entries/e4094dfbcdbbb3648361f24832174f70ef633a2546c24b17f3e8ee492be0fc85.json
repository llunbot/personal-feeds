Now, in a set of interviews posted today (but conducted during last week's unveiling event), Nintendo executives are explaining and defending those prices, even as Trump's tariffs are <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-to-assess-trump-tariff-effects/\">apparently forcing the company to pause and reassess its whole launch strategy</a>.</p>\n<p>Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svRmWFAGLJg\">speaking to CNBC</a> just as Trump's tariffs were being announced and said in the moment that \"we're still all trying to really understand [the tariffs] better and understand what possible impacts may arise from that.\" At the same time, he said that the company \"didn't consider tariffs into that equation\" when choosing the Switch 2's $450 price and instead went with what \"we felt that was going to be the right price point for our consumers and the right value proposition, if you will, for the device that we're creating.\"</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in that CNBC interview, Bowser suggested that Nintendo isn't following the Wii U example of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/08/nintendo-wii-u-still-being-sold-at-a-loss/\">selling hardware at a loss</a> in order to gain more potential software customers. Instead, Bowser said the company is \"trying to find a way to maintain... margins on the hardware even though they may be more slim than they are on software,\" and then \"to make sure that they're seeing the value in their investment in one of our devices\" through software.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-explains-why-switch-2-hardware-and-software-prices-cost-so-much/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-explains-why-switch-2-hardware-and-software-prices-cost-so-much/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e4094dfbcdbbb3648361f24832174f70ef633a2546c24b17f3e8ee492be0fc85","category":"Tech"}
