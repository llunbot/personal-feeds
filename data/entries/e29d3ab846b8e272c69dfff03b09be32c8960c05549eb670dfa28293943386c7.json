On his way, Neer straps in for urban riding in the villages of Cinque Terre, shreds singletrack in the Dolomites, and finds himself lost in caffeine fueled hallucinations and Alfa Romeo mechanicals before discovering what his journey was really about. So, prepare yourself a beverage, sit back and enjoy the journey.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Film by Joey Schusler, Ben Page, Thomas Woodson.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/yeti-cycles-presents-cafe-americano/\">Yeti Cycles Presents: Cafe Americano</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e29d3ab846b8e272c69dfff03b09be32c8960c05549eb670dfa28293943386c7","category":"Cycling"}
