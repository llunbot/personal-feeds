But aside from adding more cargo hauling options, the new rack means trips into the mountains where deep snow may have once cut days short don’t have to end as quickly, and getting there is easier on the earth and cheaper than revving up a gas guzzler.</p><div id=\"attachment_279646\"><p><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-279646\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/30202056/yuba1.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Yuba Snow rack mounted on bike.

Other add-ons include soft spots and backrests for even more comfort. The rack is made with aluminum and can be quickly attached and detached for use only when needed. &nbsp;The setup requires spicy curry sideboards, which go for MSRP $120.
