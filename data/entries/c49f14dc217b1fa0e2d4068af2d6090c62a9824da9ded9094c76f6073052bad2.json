More performance, a bigger battery, more ports, a larger screen…if you need <em>more</em>, you need a MacBook Pro. If you want a Mac laptop with a display larger than 13-14 inches, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is your only option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you spend all that money (often upwards of $3,000) on something you hope to keep and use for years, it’s worth asking if this is a good time to buy. In the world of computers, there’s always something better on the way, but if it’s a <em>lot</em> better and it’s coming <em>soon</em>, you might want to wait. Here’s what we know about the MacBook Pro and our buying advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>16-inch MacBook Pro: Pricing and specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Released: November 2019</strong><br />It has been almost two years since Apple updated the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The current version features a 9th-generation Intel Core i7 or Core i9 CPU, which is definitely no longer state-of-the-art. They also have dedicated graphics, ranging from an AMD Radeon Pro 5300M up to a 5600M in the custom configurations. That’s behind the times, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Configurations start with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage, which is reasonable for a high-end laptop, and all 16-inch MacBook Pros have four Thunderbolt 3 ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the display isn’t bad, the 3072‑by‑1920 resolution is a little on the low side for a high-end laptop of this size. And it supports wide color and True Tone, but not HDR, nor refresh rates in excess of 60Hz, nor variable refresh rates.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>16-inch MacBook Pro 2.4GHz 8-core Core i9 (2019)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/11/16in-macbook-pro-100817714-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.66GHz 6-Core, 512GB $2,399 | 2.3GHz 8-Core, 1TB $2,799\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/473657/7613?prodsku=MVVL2LL%2FA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fgo%2Fproduct%2FMVVL2&amp;intsrc=CATF_3652&amp;subid1=1-1-354078-5-246423-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$2399.00 at Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6366564&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6366564%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-354078-5-246423-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$2399.99 at Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081FTNGNC?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$2,629.00 at Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>16-inch MacBook Pro: Why you should buy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being a couple of years old, this is literally the only option for Mac users who want a big-screen laptop. It’s this or 13.3 inches, those are your choices. If you really need that bigger display and you need it now, you’re sort of backed into a corner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>16-inchMacBook Pro: Why you should wait</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346129/2021-macbook-pro-14-inch-16-inch-mini-led-m1x-touch-bar-card-reader-webcam-thunderbolt-magsafe-price-release.html\">big update to the MacBook Pro in the fall of 2021</a>. Not only is it expected to feature an M1X processor that’s a lot faster than the M1 and the 2.6GHz 6‑core Intel Core i7 in the current 16-inch MacBook Pro, but it’s also rumored to have a new design and a bunch of new features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the rumors are true, we’re looking at a return of the SD card slot and maybe HDMI port, a MagSafe charger (though maybe it’s some sort of new MagSafe thing?), a display with mini-LED backlighting which will probably support HDR, and thinner bezels. And the Touch Bar might be going away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, we may be a few short months away from a <em>massive</em> improvement to the MacBook Pro, and it’s worth waiting to see what that is before you drop a big chunk of money on something you’ll keep for years. The new version might carry a higher starting price, but it’s expected to be such a huge all-around improvement that it’ll be worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Macworld recommends: WAIT</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A new MacBook Pro is a big investment, and the 16-inch model means spending at least $2,400 (and often much more). You’re probably going to hang on to this thing for four or five years, the last thing you want to do is buy it just a couple of months before a vastly better version lands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the MacBook Air, which is both more affordable and will probably not be updated as soon, the MacBook Pro is a bigger expense with a shorter wait for the new version. So we recommend you wait until the fall of 2021 to see if Apple does unveil the new 16-inch MacBook Pro as expected before spending all that money. So if you want the MacBook Pro Apple makes, you have even more reason to wait—the current 16-inch model is practically a dinosaur.</p>\n</div>","author":"Jason Cross","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c49f14dc217b1fa0e2d4068af2d6090c62a9824da9ded9094c76f6073052bad2","category":"Apple"}
