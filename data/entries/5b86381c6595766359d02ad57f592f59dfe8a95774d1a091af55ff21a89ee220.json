The ‘+’ spring acts as per a standard air spring, and is used to set the sag of the shock. It impacts on early-stroke sensitivity and mid-stroke support. The ‘++’ spring is secondary and controls the ramp-up of the unit – replacing the need for volume spacers.</p>\n<p>Volume spacers work well, of course, but impact on the shock’s spring curve throughout the shock’s compression. By separating them, EXT says you have even more control over the suspension’s characteristics.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/EXT-Aria-air-valves-92cbbaa.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"EXT Aria air valves\" title=\"EXT Aria air valves\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The dual air springs are inflated from side-by-side valves.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/EXT-Aria-body-db9b13b.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"EXT Aria body\" title=\"EXT Aria body\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The air can has a fairly high volume, on initial impression.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/EXT-Aria-controls-add4c9b.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"EXT Aria controls\" title=\"EXT Aria controls\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>An adjustable lockout and adjustable hydraulic bottom-out control are present on the piggyback.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p> </p>\n<p>EXT has also popped in adjustable hydraulic control, which adds further control to the last 10-15 per cent of the suspension stroke, and offers 30-70 per cent extra progression.</p>\n<p>Add in a lockout that’s also adjustable (enabling you to run the bike ‘locked’ on flow trails for the ultimate in support) and you’ve got one of the most nerdy shocks on the market.

It’s designed to be a little less aggressive and a little more forgiving than the Pro.</p>\n<p>The Trail has ‘fluting’ around its edge, giving the insert a bit more flex when the bike is leant over.</p>\n<p>It should feel less ‘obvious’ than the Pro, interfering less with ride feel in everyday conditions.However, CushCore says the harder you push, the more progressively it supports the tyre.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img

from your usual carbon layup.</p>\n<p>Standard carbon fibre uses an epoxy resin to hold the carbon strands together. This material needs cold storage, can’t withstand multiple heat cycles well, and creates a very rigid and brittle bond within the layup.</p>\n<p>Forge+Bond has swapped the epoxy for a nylon-based material.</p>\n<p>This can withstand multiple heat cycles, and enables the brand to first bond the materials together with heat, and then forge them into the correct shapes.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/ForgeBond-wheel-68efeb1.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"While my photo might not be great, these wheels show plenty of promise - I'm looking forward to testing them\" title=\"Forge+Bond wheel\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>These wheels show plenty of promise – we’re looking forward to testing them.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/04/ForgeBond-tyre-lever-0f45013.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Forge+Bond tyre lever\" title=\"Forge+Bond tyre lever\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Broken rims can be turned into items such as this tyre lever.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Forge+Bond claims the material has more micro-flex within it, meaning it’s less brittle. This gives the wheels a touch more compliance, leading to improved ride characteristics.</p>\n<p>The material is also much easier to recycle.
