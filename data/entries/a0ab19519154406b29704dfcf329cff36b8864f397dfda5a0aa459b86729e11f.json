The cordless device, which wirelessly connects to the local network of organizations that use it, allows engineers to tighten bolts and other mechanical fastenings to precise torque levels that are critical for safety and reliability. When fastenings are too loose, they risk causing the device to overheat and start fires. When too tight, threads can fail and result in torques that are too loose. The Nutrunner provides a torque-level indicator display thatâ€™s backed by a certification from the Association of German Engineers and adopted by the automotive industry in 1999. The NEXO-OS, the firmware running on devices, can be controlled using a browser-based management interface.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nexo-os-management-web-appl.png\"><img alt=\"NEXO-OS's management web application.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nexo-os-management-web-appl-640x451.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nexo-os-management-web-appl.png 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nexo-os-management-web-appl.png\">NEXO-OS's management web application.</a> (credit: Nozomi)</p></div>\n<p>Nozomi researchers said the device is riddled with 23 vulnerabilities that, in certain cases, can be exploited to install malware. The malware could then be used to disable entire fleets of the devices or to cause them to tighten fastenings too loosely or tightly while the display continues to indicate the critical settings are still properly in place.
