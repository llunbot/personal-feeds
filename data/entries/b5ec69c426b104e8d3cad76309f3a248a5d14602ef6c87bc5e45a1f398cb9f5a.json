{"title":"Apple Announces iOS 18.2's New AirTag Location Sharing Feature Coming to These 15+ Airlines","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/apple-announces-airtag-location-sharing/","date":1731341880000,"content":"Last week, we reported on a new feature in the Find My app on the iOS 18.2 beta that allows you to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/find-my-share-lost-item-location/\">temporarily share an AirTag's location</a> with a trusted person, and soon with airlines. Apple today <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/11/apples-find-my-enables-sharing-location-of-lost-items-with-third-parties/\">announced</a> the feature, providing more details.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iOS-18-2-Share-Item-Location.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nApple said more than 15 airlines will offer the feature \"in the coming months,\" including Delta, United, Air Canada, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, KLM, Lufthansa, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Air New Zealand, Austrian Airlines, Aer Lingus, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, Iberia, SWISS, Turkish Airlines, and Vueling. More airlines will follow \"over time.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnited is aiming to implement the feature systemwide in \"early 2025,\" according to a quote the airline provided in Apple's press release.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature will be integrated into each airline's customer service process for locating mishandled or delayed baggage, according to Apple. This will make it easier for the airline to help find lost bags with an AirTag attached to them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone, iPad, and Mac users running iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 can generate a \"Share Item Location\" link in the Find My app. Anyone they share the link with can then view a website with a location of the item on a map. The website will automatically update with the item's latest known location. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-Share-Item-Location-iPhone-iPad-Mac.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nApple said it worked directly with airlines to put systems in place to \"privately and securely\" accept the \"Share Item Location\" links. Access to each link will be \"limited to a small number of people,\" and recipients will be required to \"authenticate\" to view the link through either their Apple Account or partner email address. The item's location will stop being shared \"as soon as a user is reunited with their item,\" or at any time that the item's owner decides. An item's shared location will automatically expire after seven days.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"The Find My network and AirTag have proven to be a powerful combination for users while traveling, providing invaluable location information when bags have been misplaced or mishandled,\" said Apple's services chief Eddy Cue. \"With Share Item Location, we're excited to give users a new way to easily share this information directly with third parties like airlines, all while protecting their privacy.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to items equipped with an AirTag, the feature also works with third-party accessories and item trackers that support the Find My network.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple previously confirmed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-confirms-ios-18-2-december-launch/\">iOS 18.2 will be released in December</a>, and that means iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2 should also be available then.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/\">AirTag</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/apple-announces-airtag-location-sharing/\">Apple Announces iOS 18.2's New AirTag Location Sharing Feature Coming to These 15+ Airlines</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-ios-18-2s-new-airtag-location-sharing-feature-coming-to-these-15-airlines.2442620/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b5ec69c426b104e8d3cad76309f3a248a5d14602ef6c87bc5e45a1f398cb9f5a","category":"Apple"}
