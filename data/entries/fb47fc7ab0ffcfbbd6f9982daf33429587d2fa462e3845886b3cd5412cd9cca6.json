He also highlighted how AI is already behind several features on Apple devices, such as Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>'s predictive autocorrect.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is believed to now be spending <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-conversational-ai-spending/\">millions of dollars a day</a> on conversational AI research.
