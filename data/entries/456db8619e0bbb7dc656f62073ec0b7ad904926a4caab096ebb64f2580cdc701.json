Ransomware group Rhysida dumped 1.67TB of data, including assets and story spoilers from unreleased games, a road map of upcoming titles, internal company communications, employees' personal data such as passport scans and compensation figures, and much more.</p>\n<p>The gang said it chose Insomniac because, as a large and successful studio, it made an attractive target for a money grab. The ransom was $2 million, and Insomniac refused to pay it.</p>\n<p>As a result, a trove of emails, Slack messages, slideshow presentations, and more hit the web. Notably, these included screenshots and assets from the studio's upcoming <em>Wolverine</em> game, as well as confirmation that <em>Wolverine</em> is planned to be the first in a trilogy of games starring X-Men characters. The materials also revealed that the company is working on another Ratchet &amp; Clank game and a new Spider-Man sequel.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992064#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992064&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"456db8619e0bbb7dc656f62073ec0b7ad904926a4caab096ebb64f2580cdc701","category":"Tech"}
