Until recently, however, the brand did not have a throttle-equipped electric bike in its lineup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=15585&amp;pw=293233&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fbikes%2Fhybrid-bikes%2Felectric-hybrid-bikes%2Ffx%2Fc%2FB465%2F\" target=\"_blank\">FX+ 1 and FX+ 1S</a> are the brand’s latest ebikes, and the first to offer throttle capability. At $2000, they also happen to be among the most affordable models in Trek’s ebike range. These versatile ebikes appear to be well-suited to everything from urban riding and commuting to recreational riding on paved surfaces or smooth off-paved terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FX+ 1 is available in two versions, so riders can choose the ebike class that best suits their needs and local regulations. The maximum throttle speed for both models is 20mph. The standard FX+ 1 is a class 2 ebike that tops out at 20mph using pedal assist. The FX+ 1S gets a boost to class 3 capability with a top pedal-assisted speed of 28mph. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trek FX+1 ebikes with throttle control</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059846-2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059846-2-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059846-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059846-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059846-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059846-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059846-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059846-2-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059846-2.webp 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>Trek’s first throttle, along with the all-in-one control/display unit.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059834-2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059834-2-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"The Hyena 500W rear hub motor on the Trek FX+ 1 e-bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059834-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059834-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059834-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059834-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059834-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059834-2-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreation_Solo_NA_CA_DR_059834-2.webp 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>The 500W Hyena hub motor.</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of which version you choose, the FX+ 1 ebike have a 500W Hyena rear hub motor with up to 60Nm of torque. That’s controlled by a thumb throttle or an all-in-one display/control unit, both situated by the left grip. The FX+ 1 also pairs with the Trek Central app so you can make changes to the ebike’s settings, track ride stats, map routes, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UL-certified 520Wh battery is integrated into the downtube of the frame, providing a claimed range of up to 50 miles. Trek also includes its EasyMag “<em>industry-leading magnetic charger</em>” for convenient charging at home or on the go. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059878-2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059878-2-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059878-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059878-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059878-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059878-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059878-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059878-2-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059878-2.webp 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>The standard FX+ 1 frame.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059879-2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059879-2-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"The midstep version of the Trek FX+ 1 parked on a bike patch by the beach\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059879-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059879-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059879-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059879-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059879-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059879-2-720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_BikePortraits_NA_CA_DR_059879-2.webp 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>The FX+ 1 Midstep frame.</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The FX+ 1 ebikes come in both midstep and standard frame styles. The midstep frame has a lower step-over and standover height. And it comes in three frame sizes — S, M, and L — with a claimed user height range between 5’1” and  6’1”. The standard frame has a higher top tube and step/standover heights, and it comes in an additional XL size, expanding its user height range to 6’6”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These versatile new ebikes are similar to the other models in <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=15585&amp;pw=293233&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fbikes%2Fhybrid-bikes%2Felectric-hybrid-bikes%2Ffx%2Fc%2FB465%2F\">Trek’s FX+ family,</a> with a frame design, geometry, and features that lean toward the urban, commuter, and fitness side of the spectrum. With the FX+ 1, however, Trek enhanced its surface versatility with 27.5-inch wheels and plump, 50mm (2″) Bontrager GR0 gravel tires. This makes it look capable of venturing on smooth unpaved roads, paths, and trails. Or will simply make it more comfortable over rough surfaces in the concrete jungle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Adventure_NA_CA_DR_059623-2-1.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Adventure_NA_CA_DR_059623-2-1.webp\" alt=\"Riding the Trek FX+ 1 e-bike on a smooth unpaved path\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Adventure_NA_CA_DR_059623-2-1.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Adventure_NA_CA_DR_059623-2-1-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Adventure_NA_CA_DR_059623-2-1-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Adventure_NA_CA_DR_059623-2-1-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Adventure_NA_CA_DR_059623-2-1-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Adventure_NA_CA_DR_059623-2-1-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Adventure_NA_CA_DR_059623-2-1-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Wider gravel tires expand the FX+ 1’s horizons.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hydraulic disc brakes with 180mm rotors are tasked with speed control, while an 8-speed Shimano ESSA drivetrain handles shifting duties. A fork-mounted headlight and a taillight with brake light and turn signal functionality help you see your way in the dark, while also making you more visible to motorists and other riders. The frame also has mounts for a rear rack or fenders, should you wish to add either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that adds up to a claimed weight of 48.73 pounds for a size medium. There are lighter ebikes out there for sure, but that figure is respectable for any ebike with a 520Wh battery and 500W hub motor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreate_01_NA_CA_DR_059578-2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreate_01_NA_CA_DR_059578-2.webp\" alt=\"two riders on the Trek FX+1 e-bikes, smiling while riding on a paved path\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreate_01_NA_CA_DR_059578-2.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreate_01_NA_CA_DR_059578-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreate_01_NA_CA_DR_059578-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreate_01_NA_CA_DR_059578-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreate_01_NA_CA_DR_059578-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreate_01_NA_CA_DR_059578-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TK25_FX_Throttle_Recreate_01_NA_CA_DR_059578-2-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Smiles for miles on the new Trek FX+ 1 electric bikes.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the new Trek FX+ 1 ebikes appear to be versatile and down for everything from the daily commute to adventurous rides off the beaten path.
