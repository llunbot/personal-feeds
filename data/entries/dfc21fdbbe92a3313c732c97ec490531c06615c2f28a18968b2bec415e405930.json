It is one of the appropriations from MTB that is only getting more viable as <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-groupsets\" target=\"_blank\">road groupsets</a> and frame design develop further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When 1× first emerged in around 2015 I appreciated several aspects of the concept, but it was evident that the compromises were too great for it to be accepted straight away. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"687\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04021515/3t_strada_first_look_3-970x687.jpg\" alt=\"3t_strada_first_look_3\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04021515/3t_strada_first_look_3-970x687.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04021515/3t_strada_first_look_3-300x213.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04021515/3t_strada_first_look_3-768x544.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04021515/3t_strada_first_look_3-120x86.jpg 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04021515/3t_strada_first_look_3-750x531.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04021515/3t_strada_first_look_3-1140x808.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04021515/3t_strada_first_look_3-190x136.jpg 190w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04021515/3t_strada_first_look_3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All three main groupset makers were at 11-speed cassettes at the time and only <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/sram-groupsets-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM</a> offered a complete groupset solution with its Force 1×. A 1× Shimano drivetrain could be achieved, but only by mashing together parts from its mountain bike and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-shimano-groupsets\" target=\"_blank\">road groupset families</a>, while there was no prospect of creating a 1× gearing setup from Campagnolo parts whatsoever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the choice wasn’t there and arguably neither was the performance – for many riders, 1× couldn’t sufficiently match the balance of range and close gear steps created by a 2× setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not being particularly cadence-sensitive, I can’t say having bigger jumps between gears ever bothered me that much, but I could appreciate the opinion of those who said it did.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Unique selling points</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all this, a 1× system has always possessed undeniable advantages over 2×. By ditching the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">front derailleur</a> and a chainring, a 1× groupset can be lighter, and a bike should perform (marginally) better aerodynamically. The clutch on the rear derailleur and narrow-wide chainring teeth make dropping a chain far less likely, while fewer moving parts makes <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-clean-bike-chain\" target=\"_blank\">cleaning and maintenance easier</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being more concerned with appearance than perhaps I should be, the clean look of a 1× groupset has always appealed, but a less superficial facet is how much easier it is for new riders to get their head around shifting. Regardless of manufacturer (the big three all go about derailleur actuation using different lever mechanics), 1× nurtures a more intuitive shifting experience: a shift one way makes the gears harder, while the other way makes them easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135026/vielo_r1_alto_review_04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"vielo_r1_alto_review_04\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135026/vielo_r1_alto_review_04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135026/vielo_r1_alto_review_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135026/vielo_r1_alto_review_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135026/vielo_r1_alto_review_04-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135026/vielo_r1_alto_review_04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135026/vielo_r1_alto_review_04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135026/vielo_r1_alto_review_04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135026/vielo_r1_alto_review_04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/02/06135026/vielo_r1_alto_review_04.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s no stretch to say that 1× gearing has the potential to make road cycling more inclusive, by being easier to use for new cyclists and by being more familiar for mountain bikers who are tarmac-curious. That can only be a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of the system go beyond gearing and impact on frame design too. Brands such as <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/3t-strada-review\" target=\"_blank\">3T</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/vielo-r1-alto-1x-road-bike-review\" target=\"_blank\">Vielo</a> say they are able to extract extra performance in stiffness and aerodynamics by not having to cater for a front derailleur and two chainrings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tipping the balance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the naysayers, all these little advantages could never quite outweigh the range/ratio gearing issue. But in reply I’d say that issue no longer really exists.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03084511/campagnolo_ekar_cassette-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"campagnolo_ekar_cassette\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03084511/campagnolo_ekar_cassette-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03084511/campagnolo_ekar_cassette-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03084511/campagnolo_ekar_cassette-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03084511/campagnolo_ekar_cassette-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03084511/campagnolo_ekar_cassette-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03084511/campagnolo_ekar_cassette-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03084511/campagnolo_ekar_cassette-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03084511/campagnolo_ekar_cassette-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/03084511/campagnolo_ekar_cassette.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-grx-rx820-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">now Shimano too</a> offers wide-range 12-speed cassettes and Campagnolo has its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Ekar 13-speed</a>. For me, the move to 12 and subsequently 13-speed puts the gearing argument to bed. Using a typical Campagnolo Ekar setup as an example, a 38t chainring paired with a 9-36t cassette creates almost exactly the same range as using a 50/34 chainset with an 11-30 cassette, and cedes only one or two discreet gear ratios to that setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, that range is achieved despite the smallest six sprockets ascending in one-tooth increments, which means that big gear steps in a 1× drivetrain are now largely unseen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do recognise the need for 2× drivetrains in certain situations: in a race environment, for example, a 2× setup can be more efficient as it preserves a straighter chainline, with the chain contorting at less extreme angles than with 1×. Furthermore, 2× will continue to be necessary for certain individuals who are particularly fussy about cadence. Yet for the vast majority of amateur cyclists, I can only see 1× gearing as having huge potential to make riding lives better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It won’t be possible to convert every bike of course, but if your setup lends itself to 1×, I would recommend upgrading when you get the chance.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-1x-gearing-road-bikes\">Opinion: 1× gearing on road bikes is where it’s at</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"dfc21fdbbe92a3313c732c97ec490531c06615c2f28a18968b2bec415e405930","category":"Cycling"}
