a new carcass construction that it says leads to a 24 per cent reduction in rolling resistance for a 28mm tyre compared to the previous generation.</span></p>\n<p><span>Although the new P Zero Race TLR has the same SmartEVO rubber compound as the outgoing tyre, Pirelli says its new Speedcore construction uses aramid fibres to provide improved puncture protection. </span></p>\n<p><span>The new construction also allows for a thinner, more pliant casing and lower rolling resistance. </span></p>\n<p>The tyres are available in either black or tan wall options, with sizes ranging from 26mm to 32mm depending on spec.</p>\n<h2>Aramid fibres for increased pliancy</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pirelli claims its new

tyre’s light weight (299g), easy tubeless setup and impressive air retention. </span></p>\n<p><span>We also noted the previous-generation tyre’s <a

by the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/worldtour-bikes/\">Trek-Segafredo</a> pro team.</span></p>\n<p><span>We were also impressed by the tyre’s ride, with rolling resistance that already felt as low as the </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tubeless-road-tyres/\"><span>best road bike tyres</span></a><span>, so a 24 per cent improvement

There’s a 32mm width that comes only with black sidewalls. </span></p>\n<p><span>In line with the trend for increasingly </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/are-wider-tyres-faster/\"><span>wide tyres</span></a><span> on road bikes, Pirelli will be introducing 35mm and 40mm-wide tyres later this year.
