While we're getting to the end of the beta testing period, Apple is still tweaking features and adding new functionality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.2-Feature-Warm.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWe've rounded up everything new in the fourth beta of iOS 17.2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Default Notification Sound</h2>\r<br />\nUnder Sounds &amp; Haptics, there's a new \"Default Alerts\" section that allows you to choose the sound used for all incoming notifications aside from texts, mail alerts, and calendar alerts, which already had customization options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-default-alert.jpg\" width=\"5526\" height=\"3108\" />\r<br />\nAll of the text tones can be used for the default notification sound, plus there is an option to also change the haptic vibration of default notifications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Collaborative Apple Music Playlists</h2>\r<br />\nWhile collaborative <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> playlists were introduced in an earlier version of iOS 17.2, Apple has removed the option in the fourth beta, which suggests this is not an option that will be coming in iOS 17.2 after all.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-collaborative-playlists.jpg\" width=\"5484\" height=\"3085\" />\r<br />\n<h2>AppleCare Settings</h2>\r<br />\nThe \"Coverage\" section under Settings &gt; General has been renamed to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a> &amp; Warranty. It still includes ‌AppleCare‌ info for your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and connected devices such as the Apple Watch and AirPods.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/applecare-warranty-ios-17-2.jpg\" width=\"2452\" height=\"1379\" />\r<br />\nUnder General &gt; About there's a new Warranty section that provides coverage information for the ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Recording to an External Device</h2>\r<br />\nWith the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, ProRes video can be recorded directly to an external device. iOS 17.2 appears to include a new pop up message that lets users know that external recording is not working because of a USB-C cable that is too slow.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere was previously a warning about an external storage device not having a fast enough write speed to support external recording, but now there is an added message about the write speed of the USB-C cable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iTunes</h2>\r<br />\nCode in iOS 17.2 confirms that Apple is planning to eliminate the option to purchase TV shows and movies in the iTunes app. TV and movie content will need to be purchased in the TV app in the future, but for now, the change has not actually been implemented.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"You can buy or rent TV shows and find your purchases in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> app,\" reads the code.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>More iOS 17.2 Beta 4 Features</h2>\r<br />\nKnow of a feature that we left out in this list?
