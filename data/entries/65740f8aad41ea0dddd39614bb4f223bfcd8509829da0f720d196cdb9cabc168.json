It could be on its slow-burn second act, like <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/sean-murray-tells-us-nearly-everything-to-expect-in-no-mans-sky-beyond/\">No Man’s Sky</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/23903801/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-review-skills-perks\">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em>, or <em><a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/why-final-fantasy-14-failed-and-how-it-was-reborn/\">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>. It could have settled into a disgruntled-but-still-invested player base, like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/three-months-in-destiny-2-has-a-quality-of-life-problem/\"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> or <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Or its technical debts could have been slowly paid off to let its underlying strengths come through, as with <em>Disco Elysium</em> or <em>The Witcher 3.</em></p>\n<p>But <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em> (<em>C:S2)</em> is regrettably available now in its current state. It has serious performance problems, both acknowledged by its 30-odd-employee developer Colossal Order and studied in-depth by others (which we’ll get into). It has a rough-draft look when compared to its predecessor, which has accumulated eight years of fixes, DLC, and mods to cover a dizzying array of ideas. Worst of all, it was highly anticipated by fans, some of whom have high-end systems that still can't properly run the sluggish game.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984342#p3\">Read 37 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984342&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"65740f8aad41ea0dddd39614bb4f223bfcd8509829da0f720d196cdb9cabc168","category":"Tech"}
