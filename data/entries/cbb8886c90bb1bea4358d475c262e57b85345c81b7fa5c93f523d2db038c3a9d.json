But our patience is wearing thin, and your\nrefusal has cost all of us,” he said, all but biting off his\nwords. The unvaccinated minority “can cause a lot of damage, and\nthey are.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>More like this, please. Mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for everything. For getting on a flight, for going to school, for eating in a restaurant, for keeping your job. Yes, mandating <em>anything</em> is an extraordinary use of authority, but this pandemic is clearly the most extraordinary crisis most of us have ever lived through. It’s exactly why the federal government has the far more extraordinary power to draft men into the armed services and send them to war: for the greater good.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/09/biden-vaccine-mandate\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"cbb8886c90bb1bea4358d475c262e57b85345c81b7fa5c93f523d2db038c3a9d","category":"Tech"}
