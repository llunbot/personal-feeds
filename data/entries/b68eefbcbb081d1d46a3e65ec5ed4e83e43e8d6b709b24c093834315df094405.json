The website switched its domain registration from GoDaddy to Epik and switched its name servers from GoDaddy to hosting provider Digital Ocean. Digital Ocean quickly cut off service, and the abortion-whistleblower site's <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/prolifewhistleblower.com\">domain records</a> now list Epik as both the registrar and name servers.</p>\n<p>But the website—which encouraged people to report violations of the restrictive new anti-abortion law in Texas—is offline, and the domain now redirects to Texas Right to Life's homepage. The group says it plans to get the site back online.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792436#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792436&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b68eefbcbb081d1d46a3e65ec5ed4e83e43e8d6b709b24c093834315df094405","category":"Tech"}
