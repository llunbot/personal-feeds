AWS Summits are free in-person events that take place across the globe in major cities, bringing cloud expertise to local communities. Each AWS Summit features keynote presentations highlighting the latest innovations, technical sessions, live demos, and interactive workshops led by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> experts. Last week, events took place at <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/tel-aviv/\">AWS Summit Tel Aviv</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/singapore/\">AWS Summit Singapore</a>.</p> \n<p>The following photo shows the packed keynote at AWS Summit Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/30/1748526792799.jpeg\" alt=\"AWS Summit Tel Aviv Keynote\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" /></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/?awsf.location=*all\">Find an AWS Summit near you</a> and join thousands of AWS customers and cloud professionals taking the next step in their cloud journey.</p> \n<p>Last week, the announcement that piqued my interest most was the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-aurora-dsql-is-now-generally-available/\">general availability of Amazon Aurora DSQL</a>, which was introduced in preview at re:Invent 2024. Aurora DSQL is the fastest serverless distributed SQL database that enables you to build always available applications with virtually unlimited scalability, the highest availability, and zero infrastructure management.</p> \n<p>Aurora DSQL active-active distributed architecture is designed for 99.99% single-Region and 99.999% multi-Region availability with no single point of failure and automated failure recovery. This means your applications can continue to read and write with strong consistency, even in the rare case an application is unable to connect to a Region cluster endpoint.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/30/2025-aurora-dsql-2-architecture-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/30/2025-aurora-dsql-2-architecture-1.jpg\" alt=\"Single and multi region deployment of Amazon Aurora DSQL\" width=\"2066\" height=\"1030\" /></a></p> \n<p>What’s more fascinating is the journey behind building Aurora DSQL, a story that goes beyond the technology in the pursuit of engineering efficiency. Read the full story in Dr. Werner Vogels’ blog post, <a href=\"https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2025/05/just-make-it-scale-an-aurora-dsql-story.html\">Just make it scale: An Aurora DSQL story</a>.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last week’s launches</strong></span><br /> Here are the other launches that got my attention:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/enhance-ai-assisted-development-with-amazon-ecs-amazon-eks-and-aws-serverless-mcp-server/\">Announcing new Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for AWS Serverless and Containers</a> – MCP servers are now available for AWS Lambda, Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), and Finch.
