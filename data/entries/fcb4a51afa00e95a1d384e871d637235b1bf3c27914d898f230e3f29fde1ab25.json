The most interesting news in launch this week, to me, is that Firefly is potentially up for sale. That makes two of the handful of US companies with operational rockets, Firefly and United Launch Alliance, actively on offer. I'll be fascinated to see what the valuations of each end up being if/when sales go through.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

Firefly Aerospace investors are considering a sale that could value the closely held rocket and Moon lander maker at about $1.5 billion, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-22/firefly-aerospace-backers-said-to-explore-1-5-billion-sale\">Bloomberg reports</a>. The rocket company's primary owner, AE Industrial Partners, is working with an adviser on \"strategic options\" for Firefly. Neither AE nor Firefly commented to Bloomberg about the potential sale. AE invested $75 million into Texas-based Firefly as part of a series B financing round in 2022. The firm made a subsequent investment in its Series C round in November 2023.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026434#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026434&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fcb4a51afa00e95a1d384e871d637235b1bf3c27914d898f230e3f29fde1ab25","category":"Tech"}
