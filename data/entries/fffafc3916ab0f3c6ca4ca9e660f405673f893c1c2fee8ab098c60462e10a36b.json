{"title":"Apple TV+ Is Free This Weekend, January 4–5","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/30/apple-tv-announces-free-weekend/","date":1735664067000,"content":"\n<p>Hartley Charlton, MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple TV+ is set to be available to stream for free from Saturday,\nJanuary 4 to Sunday, January 5, providing its full catalog with no\nsubscription fee. Following a series of teasers, Apple today\nconfirmed the free weekend on social media, building anticipation\nfor new releases early in 2025 such as the second season of\n<em>Severance</em>. Simply open the Apple TV app to watch for free.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bizarrely, the only place Apple announced this seems to be <a href=\"https://x.com/AppleTV/status/1873730763356795379\">on X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DENIBgIRhrQ/\">Instagram</a>. Not a word on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/\">Apple Newsroom</a>, for example. <strong>Update:</strong> OK, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2024/12/get-a-free-all-access-pass-to-apple-tv-the-first-weekend-of-2025/\">it’s also posted on Apple’s dedicated press release site for TV+</a>, which I heretofore didn’t know existed.</p>\n\n<p>Apple TV+ has an abundance of great shows (but a relative dearth of good original movies, with Scorsese’s <em><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/killers-of-the-flower-moon/umc.cmc.5x1fg9vferlfeutzpq6rra1zf\">Killers of the Flower Moon</a></em> being the standout exception). I wouldn’t hesitate to argue that the average quality of an Apple TV+ original show is higher than that for any other streaming platform. It really is the new HBO. But for one weekend of free viewing I can easily name my two favorites, both of which I think will stand the test of time and long be remembered: <em><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/show/severance/umc.cmc.1srk2goyh2q2zdxcx605w8vtx\">Severance</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/show/slow-horses/umc.cmc.2szz3fdt71tl1ulnbp8utgq5o\">Slow Horses</a></em>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/31/apple-tv-free-weekend\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"fffafc3916ab0f3c6ca4ca9e660f405673f893c1c2fee8ab098c60462e10a36b","category":"Tech"}
