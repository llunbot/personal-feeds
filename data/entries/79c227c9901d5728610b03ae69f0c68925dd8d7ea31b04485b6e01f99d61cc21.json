{"title":"Dumbphones in 2024","link":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/the-dumbphone-boom-is-real","date":1714003016000,"content":"\n<p>Kyle Chayka, writing for The New Yorker:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two years ago, they both tried Apple’s Screen Time restriction\ntool and found it too easy to disable, so the pair decided to\ntrade out their iPhones for more low-tech devices. They’d heard\nabout so-called dumbphones, which lacked the kinds of bells and\nwhistles — a high-resolution screen, an app store, a video camera — that made smartphones so addictive. But they found the process\nof acquiring one hard to navigate. “The information on it was kind\nof disparate and hard to get to. A lot of people who know the most\nabout dumbphones spend the least time online,” Krigbaum said. A\ncertain irony presented itself: figuring out a way to be less\nonline required aggressive online digging.</p>\n\n<p>The couple — Stults is twenty-nine, and Krigbaum is twenty-five — saw a business opportunity. “If somebody could condense it and\nsimplify it to the best options, maybe more people would make the\nswitch,” Krigbaum said. In late 2022, they launched an e-commerce\ncompany, <a href=\"https://dumbwireless.com/\">Dumbwireless</a>, to sell phones, data plans, and accessories\nfor people who want to reduce time spent on their screens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Chayka’s story ran under the bold headline “The Dumbphone Boom Is Real”, which is incongruously clickbait-y for The New Yorker:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Stults takes business calls on his personal cell, and on one\nrecent morning the first call came at 5 a.m. (As the lead on\ncustomer service, he has to use a smartphone — go figure.) They\npack each order by hand, sometimes with handwritten notes. They\nhave not yet quit their day jobs, which are in the service\nindustry, but Dumbwireless sold more than seventy thousand\ndollars’ worth of products last month, ten times more than in\nMarch, 2023. Krigbaum and Stults noticed an acceleration in sales\nlast October, which they speculate may have had something to do\nwith the onslaught of holiday-shopping season. Some of their\npopular phone offerings include the <a href=\"https://www.dumbwireless.com/products/light-phone-2-black\">Light Phone</a>, an e-ink device\nwith almost no apps; the <a href=\"https://www.dumbwireless.com/products/nokia-2780\">Nokia 2780</a>, a traditional flip phone; and\nthe <a href=\"https://www.dumbwireless.com/products/punkt-mp02\">Punkt.</a>, a calculator-ish Swiss device that looks like\nsomething designed for Neo to carry in “The Matrix” (which, to be\nfair, is a movie of the dumbphone era).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>$70K/month in sales is legit, but far from a boom.</p>\n\n<p>The two things that get me when I ponder, even for a moment, carrying a dumbphone: audio (podcasts/music) and camera. Pre-iPhone I’d leave the house with both a phone and an iPod, and sometimes a camera too. I actually just bought <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/04/online_photo_storage_is_surely_expensive_but_apple_should_offer_more#fn1-2024-04-09\">a new pocket-sized camera</a> last year, but it seems ludicrous to even consider carrying a dedicated device just for audio, and with music streaming, people expect their portable audio player to have always-available networking. Also: AirPods. I’m not going back to wired earbuds, <em>especially</em> in the winter.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/24/dumbphones-in-2024\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"79c227c9901d5728610b03ae69f0c68925dd8d7ea31b04485b6e01f99d61cc21","category":"Tech"}
