Up to four players can play at one time, though there's also a solo version of the game.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCrossy Road Castle for Vision Pro has the same features as the other versions of the game, including characters and hats to unlock, game controller support, and challenge events to complete. Levels are procedurally generated, so each new game is different.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSolitaire Stories provides players with a virtual card table to play classic solitaire games. There are multiple versions of solitaire included, such as Klondike Quick Play, Spider, and Draw 3, as well as support for online multiplayer gameplay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe game includes a progressive story with increasingly difficult levels, along with different deck designs to unlock. There are also daily challenges and contests.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCrossy Road Castle and Solitaire Stories will soon be available for download <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/vision\">from the Vision Pro App Store</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSeveral ‌Apple Arcade‌ games available on iOS and macOS are receiving updates today, including Puyo Puyo Puzzle Pop, Cooking Mama: Cuisine, Fruit Ninja Classic, and Zookeeper World.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/apple-vision-pro-crossy-road-solitaire-stories/\">Apple Vision Pro Gains Apple Arcade Games Crossy Road Castle and Solitaire Stories</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-gains-apple-arcade-games-crossy-road-castle-and-solitaire-stories.2424837/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa1ff3986c3936ab15c803277b81d70058719bdbd9b9a1ba6029f68aab35d32e","category":"Apple"}
