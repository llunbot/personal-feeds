That leaves America and Russia (the only two superpowers left standing) pointing fingers at each other over the ensuing blackout and global economic collapse. Each side responds via a proxy war, covertly deploying No-Pat task forces to safeguard its interests in climate conflict zones. You come in, boots on the ground, as one of several special-ops personnel, fighting meaningless battles <em>ad nauseam</em> in a ruined world for whichever side pays you.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814806#p3\">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814806&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Steve Haske","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5b271537a6dd735c8c55ee33277efd06fc7c33ec5c74be5c77b7acc2a1bfd104","category":"Tech"}
