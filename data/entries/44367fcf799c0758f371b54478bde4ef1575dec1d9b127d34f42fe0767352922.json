These sales can be found across Verizon and Amazon, and in terms of the Verizon sale you don't need to be a Verizon customer to get these savings, and all orders receive free two-day shipping.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-2-and-Pro-2-Discount-Feature-Red-Triad.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Verizon and Amazon.

We very briefly saw a discount on this model to $194.99 back in March, but this rare deal never emerged again and today's deal remains a solid second-best price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-airpods-pro-2nd-generation%2F%3Fsku%3Dsku5600070\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$50 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 for $199.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAdditionally, Amazon has a deal on one of the AirPods 3 models. You can get the AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$149.99</strong></a>, down from $169.99. This is about $10 off from the all-time low price on this model of the AirPods 3, but we haven't tracked that price in months and Amazon's deal is a solid second-best option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$20 OFF</div>AirPods 3 (Lightning) for $149.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLastly, Amazon has the AirPods 2 for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$99.00</strong></a>, down from $129.00. Although this is an overall second-best price, we haven't seen an all-time low price on the AirPods 2 since the holiday season, making this the best price of the year so far on the model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$30 OFF</div>AirPods 2 for $99.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe track sales for every model of the AirPods in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-deals/\">Best AirPods Deals</a> guide, so be sure to bookmark that page while you shop around for the wireless headphones.
