A separate alert from the FSB, Russia's Federal Security Service, alleged Apple cooperated with the NSA in the campaign. An Apple representative denied the claim.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943622#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943622&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"be23af2255e09b907bdcca199d471238686372df7e7865e2e9ed6632f38a8faa","category":"Tech"}
