Details, including the settlement amount, were not disclosed, Reuters reported, but plaintiffs agreed in a <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/In-RE-Google-Play-Store-Antitrust-Litigation-Tentative-settlement-9-5-2023.pdf\">court filing</a> yesterday not to oppose the court's decision on the class-action certification. At one point, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/google-customers-win-class-action-status-in-lawsuit-over-app-store-prices/\">plaintiffs estimated that Google might owe them $4.7 billion in damages</a>; however, it was previously reported that losing the class-action status would significantly reduce damages for states and customers suing.</p>\n<p>Nothing will be finalized until the settlement is approved by the State Attorneys General and Google owner Alphabet Incâ€™s board of directors. After that, a long-form settlement agreement must be reached before final approval by the court.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965786#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965786&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a6554c5efa1fa3b22880678da1e20547c55083be219cfd9f9cbf7638d584fbc3","category":"Tech"}
