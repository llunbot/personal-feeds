This new campaign is for their new Daysaver Incredible Pump. A pump that promises “superior usability and an integrated handle”. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-direct-or-the-hose-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"651\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-direct-or-the-hose-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Daysaver Incredible Pump direct or the hose\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-direct-or-the-hose-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-direct-or-the-hose-297x151.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-direct-or-the-hose-120x61.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-direct-or-the-hose-768x391.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Daysaver)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Daysaver Incredible Pump will be available in two sizes, Regular (40ccm) and Large (80ccm). The Large size is said to be great for mountain bikes and gravel tires. The hose has an innovative head that can be screwed on and pulled off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The integrated handle of the pump is telescopic. You unscrew it, pull it out, turn it to tighten, and then you can use it to pump your tire back up. Check out the video below! </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two different ways for the rider to use the pump. They can place the Daysaver Incredible Pump directly on the valve to fill the tire or use the included pump hose, which is screwed onto the valve. This ensures a firm and positive connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-no-hose-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-no-hose-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Daysaver Incredible Pump no hose\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-no-hose-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-no-hose-297x81.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-no-hose-120x33.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-no-hose-768x208.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-esy-on-easy-off-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-esy-on-easy-off-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Daysaver Incredible Pump esy on, easy off\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-esy-on-easy-off-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-esy-on-easy-off-297x87.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-esy-on-easy-off-120x35.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-esy-on-easy-off-768x224.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The pump head can easily be detached from the valve by operating the release mechanism. This allows the pump head to be simply pulled off. And Daysaver guarantees the valve core will stay put. When using the supplied hose, the head can be screwed on and then simply pulled off using the clever release mechanism. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Incredible Pump has Space for Incredible Tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When picking the Large-sized Daysaver Incredible Pump the rider will have room in the pump to hold two Incredible tools. The smaller Regular-sized pump has enough room for one Incredible tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-hose-and-tools-in-the-pump-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-hose-and-tools-in-the-pump-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Daysaver Incredible Pump hose and tools in the pump\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-hose-and-tools-in-the-pump-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-hose-and-tools-in-the-pump-297x80.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-hose-and-tools-in-the-pump-120x32.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-hose-and-tools-in-the-pump-768x206.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And just like all of the Daysaver products, the beauty is in the details. Thanks to a neat and clever spring mechanism, the tools can be deployed easily and immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-hose-and-tools-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-hose-and-tools-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Daysaver Incredible Pump hose and tools\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-hose-and-tools-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-hose-and-tools-297x99.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-hose-and-tools-120x40.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-hose-and-tools-768x256.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose to store either the pump hose, the IncredibleX Multitool, or the Coworking7TL extension for tubeless riders. And all future Incredible tools will also be able to fit into the pumps.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Protected From the Elements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Daysaver Incredible Pump is weatherproof, thanks to the unique seal. That way, when the weather gets bad, and trail/road conditions deteriorate, your pump won’t take a beating. Simply lift the seal out of the way to use the pump and back again when finished.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-seals-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"313\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-seals-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Daysaver Incredible Pump seals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-seals-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-seals-297x73.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-seals-120x29.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-seals-768x188.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The handle is also protected from the elements with an o-ring seal when the pump is closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-intigrated-handle-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"665\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-intigrated-handle-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Daysaver Incredible Pump intigrated handle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-intigrated-handle-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-intigrated-handle-297x154.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-intigrated-handle-120x62.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-intigrated-handle-768x399.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frame Mount it</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-pump-mount-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-pump-mount-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Daysaver Incredible Pump pump mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-pump-mount-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-pump-mount-297x149.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-pump-mount-120x60.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daysaver-Incredible-Pump-pump-mount-768x384.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an available frame mount that fits in the same spot as a water bottle cage.
