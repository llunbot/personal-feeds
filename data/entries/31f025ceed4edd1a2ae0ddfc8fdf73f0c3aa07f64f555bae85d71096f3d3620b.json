GBA4iOS led to Delta, an emulator that has been available outside of the ‌App Store‌, but is now sanctioned by Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDelta is an all-in-one emulator that supports game systems including NES, SNES, N64, Nintendo DS, Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance. It works with popular game controllers, and supports cheats, save states, backups, syncing, and more. As this is Testut's longtime project, it is more polished and feature rich than other emulators that have popped up.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther features include custom controller skins, an option to fast forward, a \"hold\" button for games where a button needs to be consistently held, support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/haptic-touch-vs-3d-touch-whats-the-difference/\">Haptic Touch</a>, and appropriate box art for imported games. Local multiplayer gaming is available, and up to four players can participate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this week, Apple approved iGBA, a direct copy of Testut's original GBA4iOS app. iGBA made it to the top of the ‌App Store‌ charges, but Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/apple-removes-igba-from-app-store/\">pulled it</a> after learning that it was a knockoff. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nDelta can be downloaded from the ‌App Store‌ for free, and it does not collect information or include ads. The app is available in the United States and other countries, but it is not available in the European Union where it is instead being offered through an alternative app marketplace.
