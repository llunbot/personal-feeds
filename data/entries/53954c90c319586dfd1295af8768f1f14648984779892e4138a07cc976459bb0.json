[...]</p>\n\n<p>Pixelmator has signed an agreement to be acquired by Apple,\nsubject to regulatory approval. There will be no material changes\nto the Pixelmator Pro, Pixelmator for iOS, and Photomator apps at\nthis time. Stay tuned for exciting updates to come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/\">Pixelmator</a> is their longstanding image editor — more or less, a Photoshop competitor. I <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/05/30/pixelmator\">first wrote about Pixelmator</a> when it was pre-announced at the end of May 2007, and it looked so good I was dubious it would actually ship in a form resembling the amazing app they previewed. But <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/09/25/pixelmator\">ship it did</a>, at the end of September that year. I have <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/pixelmator|photomator\">linked to and referenced Pixelmator dozens of times since</a>. It’s a great app, part of the “Best Mac Apps in the World” firmament.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pixelmator.com/photomator/\">Photomator</a> is more recent, and arguably more ambitious — if it’s possible to be more ambitious than directly competing with Adobe Photoshop. It’s more like a Lightroom competitor, specifically targeting photo editing <em>and</em> photo library management and batch editing. But unlike Lightroom, Photomator builds atop your iCloud photo library, not its own discrete library. That puts Photomator in competition with a few other excellent third-party apps, like <a href=\"https://darkroom.co/\">Darkroom</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gentlemencoders.com/nitro-for-macos/\">Nitro Photo</a>. These are apps for photographers who want the benefits of storing their photos in Apple’s system photo libraries (convenience, cross-app integration, secure and reliable iCloud sync) but with more powerful editing features than Apple Photos provides.</p>\n\n<p>Both Pixelmator and Photomator are the sort of native third-party apps Apple loves to celebrate. <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/the-best-of-the-best-apple-design-awards-2011/\">Pixelmator won an Apple Design Award in 2011</a>, and Photomator (at the time named Pixelmator Photo) <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/story/id1464253103\">won an ADA in 2019</a>. A year ago <a href=\"https://www.pixelmator.com/blog/2023/11/30/photomator-is-the-mac-app-of-the-year/\">Apple named Photomator the App Store’s Mac App of the Year</a>. Pixelmator has also oft been demoed by Apple during event keynotes, as an exemplar of the functional and performance benefits of building atop native frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>They don’t just happen to be exclusive to Apple’s platforms — they’re fundamentally architected around Apple’s frameworks. The way that a small engineering team (or in the case of Pixelmator rival <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/\">Acorn</a>, a one-person engineering team) can compete against the veritable army of engineers Adobe has working on Photoshop is by building atop the rich, deep frameworks Apple provides in AppKit and UIKit. And from a design perspective, Pixelmator and Photomator already look like Apple’s own “pro” apps. From the get-go, the Pixelmator team hasn’t just followed Apple’s own trends and guidelines for UI design, they’ve helped <em>define</em> those trends. </p>\n\n<p>Does Apple want to fold these advanced features into Photos? Or do they once again see the need for separate consumer/professional first-party apps? Logic, for example, was an acquisition — <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2002/07/01Apple-Acquires-Emagic/\">but that was all the way back in 2002</a>. If Apple keeps Photomator as an actively developed product, it would be a return to the same genre they walked away from <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/06/27/aperture-photos\">when they discontinued Aperture in 2014</a>. And if Apple keeps Pixelmator going, it would be the first time they go head-to-head against Photoshop itself.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/01/pixelmator-apple\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"53954c90c319586dfd1295af8768f1f14648984779892e4138a07cc976459bb0","category":"Tech"}
