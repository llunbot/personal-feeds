A multi-million agreement is said to be on the table, propping up Ineos Greandiers’ budget onto a similar level to superteams such as UAE Team Emirates XRG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a disappointing 2024 season, in which<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-how-to-fix-ineos-grenadiers\"> the team suffered poor results</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tom-pidcock-transfer\">the surprise departure of star Tom Pidcock</a>, Ineos Grenadiers have been honest in their quest to find additional sponsors. Ineos CEO Jim Ratcliffe has been cutting back his sporting investments over the past year, and the team’s boss John Allert stated that the company ‘doesn’t want to spend more money’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rumoured deal between the two could see Ineos Grenadiers increase its current rumoured budget of €50million, but the squad may have to switch from a British to a French licence if it comes to fruition. The future of the existing TotalEnergies squad, now on the UCI ProTeam level, is also in doubt, with the French team likely to have to find a new title sponsor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Why do Ineos want it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250426LBL0120-970x647.webp\" alt=\"26/04/2025 - Liège-Bastogne-Liège - Présentation des équipes - Geraint THOMAS (INEOS GRENADIERS)\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250426LBL0120-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250426LBL0120-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250426LBL0120-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250426LBL0120-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250426LBL0120-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250426LBL0120-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250426LBL0120-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250426LBL0120-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250426LBL0120-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250426LBL0120-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since April 2019, Ineos has been the title sponsor of the team formerly known as Team Sky. The British squad then rebranded from Team Ineos to Ineos Grenadiers in an attempt to promote the company’s new car. Owned by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, the squad has a yearly budget of around £40 million according to <a href=\"https://x.com/cirogazzetta/status/1879917310808633579\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Gazzetta</em> <em>dello</em> <em>Sport</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ratcliffe’s cycling venture is part of a wider Ineos sports family, which includes minority ownership of Manchester United and a stake in the Mercedes F1 team. Ineos has been cutting some costs in its sporting realm, however, having stopped its deal with the New Zealand rugby team and the America’s Cup sailing team, and there is reported interest in selling the OGC Nice football team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past few seasons, it has been reported that Ineos has also been tighter with the purse strings when it comes to its cycling team. The prospect of new sponsors coming on board has been flirted with, but initial speculation of a new title sponsor emerged in the winter. Ineos Grenadiers CEO John Allert echoed this, telling <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/weve-talked-to-literally-hundreds-of-brands-ineos-grenadiers-ceo-gives-update-on-sponsor-hunt\" target=\"_blank\">Cycling Weekly </a></em>that he had meetings with ‘hundreds of brands’. Rumours of a merger with TotalEnergies emerged when <a href=\"https://escapecollective.com/exclusive-totalenergies-is-in-talks-to-co-title-sponsor-ineos/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Escape</em> <em>Collective</em></a><em> </em>first<em> </em>caught<em> </em>a<em> </em>whiff of the deal in March, stating that Ratcliffe wasn’t willing to pump in extra finance to the squad above its current budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reports last week support these accounts, with <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/sport/cycling/article/ineos-grenadiers-totalenergies-jim-ratcliffe-rclcntmsb\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The</em> <em>Times</em></a> detailing that a multi-million deal is close to completion. Matt Lawton from <em>The Times </em>believes this will allow Ratcliffe to free up some money to pump into Manchester United after facing criticisms of being too frugal with the football giants.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+3\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the best rides, bikes, kit and pro interviews every month, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-3-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is TotalEnergies?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-44-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-44-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-44-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-44-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-44-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-44-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-44-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-44-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-44-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-44-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-44.webp 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Aurélien Vialatte</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ventured onto the continent, you’re bound to have spotted a Total petrol station somewhere. Otherwise, you may have seen its name outside of cycling through <a href=\"https://totalenergies.com/company/strength/totalenergies-and-sport\" target=\"_blank\">its growing portfolio of sports sponsorships</a>, including football’s Africa Cup of Nations, the Top14 rugby league, motor racing and the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based in La Défense in Paris, TotalEnergies is a multinational oil and gas company, originally founded in the French state’s interest as the Compagnie Française des Pétroles in 1924. It quickly grew to become France’s largest petrochemical business, paving Total’s way to becoming one of the world’s seven biggest oil companies, often given the pejorative term of ‘Big Oil’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The French firm features in the <a href=\"https://stoxx.com/index/sx5e/\" target=\"_blank\">Euro Stoxx 50</a> and features consistently in the top quartile of <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/lists/global2000/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Forbes</em>‘ Global 2000 list</a>, most recently listed as the 25th biggest company in the world, on a similar pegging to Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Meta. In its <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/companies/totalenergies/?list=global2000\" target=\"_blank\">2024 financial summary</a>, the company reported sales of $212 billion and a yearly revenue of $21 billion. Total also has an estimated $200 billion worth of assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the nature of its work, Total has been under intense scrutiny from environmental groups, particularly for causing oil spills and chemical explosions, along with claims of bribery over the past three decades. Most pertinent, however, is its contribution to carbon emissions and global warming. The 2024 <a href=\"https://carbonmajors.org/site/data/000/027/Carbon_Majors_Launch_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Carbon Majors report</a> calculated that TotalEnergies had contributed to 0.9% of global CO₂ emissions since 1854 and 1% of emissions since 2016. Other researchers suggest that TotalEnergies emits around 1% of the globe’s annual CO₂ footprint. According to the Carbon Majors report, Total is one of the five most polluting privately owned companies in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Total rebranded as TotalEnergies in 2021 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-greenwashing-cycling\">in an attempt</a> to show its commitment to improving its environmental credentials.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-ineos-grenadiers\">What does the future look like for Ineos Grenadiers?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-how-to-fix-ineos-grenadiers\">Opinion: How do you solve a problem like Ineos?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ineos-grenadiers-problems-2023\">What’s going on with Ineos Grenadiers?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-sponsors\">Who actually are the 2025 WorldTour team sponsors?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-greenwashing-cycling\">What is greenwashing and how does it impact cycling?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Commercial interests</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/05024114/team_ineos_2019_tour_de_yorkshire_chris_auld_ap6i7316-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"team_ineos_2019_tour_de_yorkshire_chris_auld_ap6i7316\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ineos and TotalEnergies are commercially tied regardless of their future within the peloton. Both operate in the petrochemical sphere, with Ineos being the UK’s largest and one of the world’s biggest chemical multinationals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two firms have been working to integrate their assets in France, having <a href=\"https://totalenergies.com/media/news/press-releases/ineos-and-totalenergies-further-integrate-their-petrochemical-assets\" target=\"_blank\">merged a network of oil and gas pipelines</a> through the backbone of the country in 2023. The following year, the two secured a joint 50/50 stake in a <a href=\"https://www.ineos.com/news/shared-news/ineos-takes-a-major-step-forward-in-southern-france-completing-the-acquisition-of-totalenergies-petrochemical-assets-at-lavera/\" target=\"_blank\">petrochemical compound in southern France</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further acquisitions could be on the cards too. Ineos (the company) has stated its intent to expand its European and African operations. With the European energy sector now back to full power following the energy crisis of 2022 and the invasion of Ukraine, a close relationship could be particularly lucrative for both companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a sporting front, this deal would be ideal for both parties. TotalEnergies would gain wider exposure through its sponsorship of a major WorldTour team, something it can easily afford, while Ineos get to lower its contribution to the team, keeping Ratcliffe in the clear. A co-sponsorship could also bring a greater return on investment for both companies as they work together to increase the budget and hopefully the team’s future results.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What could this mean for Ineos Grenadiers?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-24-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-24-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-24-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-24-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-24-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-24-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-24-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-24-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-24-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-24-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-24-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of Ineos Grenadiers, this deal would secure some financial stability for the squad. While Ratcliffe’s other projects are struggling for cash, or getting shelved completely, Total’s proposed multi-million injection would allow the team to grow and rival the resources of Visma-Lease a Bike and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe. More importantly, this deal would see the budget increase to a point where they could even rival UAE Team Emirates XRG on a financial level, allowing the team to spend more on rider contracts, R&amp;D and staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the extra financial security, Remco Evenepoel may move into the crosshairs for a transfer. <em>Het</em> <em>Laatste Nieuws</em> speculates that the squad may switch to Specialized bikes in an attempt to lure in the Belgian, who has a personal deal with the bike brand. Ineos and TotalEnergies both have assets in Belgium, with the French firm <a href=\"https://totalenergies.com/news/press-releases/totalenergies-launches-new-battery-storage-project-belgium\" target=\"_blank\">acquiring a battery plant in Wallonia</a> last year to join their Antwerp refinery. Interest could, therefore, be high in securing Belgium’s biggest name onto their roster going forward, or at least when Evenepoel’s contract with Soudal-QuickStep ends in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Money aside, the team’s identity could change quite drastically if the dotted lign is signed.<em> <a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/ineos-grenadiers-totalenergies-merger-nearing-completion-according-to-times-report-as-new-links-to-remco-evenepoel-emerge/\" target=\"_blank\">Cycling News</a> </em>reported that TotalEnergies is keen to gain a controlling stake in the team and swap their licence to a French one, in keeping with the company’s homeland. This could also see the team change name to TotalEnergies-Ineos.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What could this mean for the current TotalEnergies squad?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250413PRX0046-970x647.webp\" alt=\"13/04/2025 - Paris-Roubaix - Compiègne / Roubaix (259,2 km) - Sandy DUJARDIN (TOTALENERGIES)\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250413PRX0046-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250413PRX0046-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250413PRX0046-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250413PRX0046-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250413PRX0046-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250413PRX0046-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250413PRX0046-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250413PRX0046-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250413PRX0046-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/20250413PRX0046-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Pauline Ballet</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The team currently sponsored by TotalEnergies is one of the longest-running squads in the pro peloton, having been founded in 2000 by Jean-René Bernaudeau. Through the years, the team has changed monikers several times, and has been known as Bonjour, Bouyges Telecom, Europcar and Direct Énergie. The most recent name change came in 2021, when Direct Énergie merged with TotalEnergies on both a commercial and sporting front. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The squad have been stalwarts of the ProTeam level over the past decade, albeit with a short-lived term in the WorldTour in 2014. They’ve been invited to the Tour de France throughout their lifespan, often fulfilling a role as a the team found in breakaways. A stage victory came their way last year courtesy of Anthony Turgis, but WorldTour promotion seems like a real longshot given <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\">the current state of the promotion and relegation battle</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the sponsor leaves for Ineos Grenadiers, a real hole will need to be filled in the squad’s budget. Total – and its former subsidiary Direct Énergies – has backed the team since 2017, often pumping in the vast majority of the budget. In this case, Bernaudeau’s team would need a new title sponsor and financial backer. They’ve done this before, but their recent results won’t be enticing for companies looking to gain a wide reach and convincing ROI. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the team completely folds – which could be likely if this deal goes through – then some riders may be offered lifeline contracts at Ineos. However, given the relative lack of WorldTour-ready names in TotalEnergies current roster, only three or four may receive a helping hand. This will leave many riders on the transfer market for 2026. Arkéa-B&amp;B is also rumoured to be in deep financial trouble, so the French scene may be on the brink of some serious trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another question to address is TotalEnergies’ current youth team, Vendée U. The project could be merged into Ineos’s new development roster at Lotto Kern-Haus to create a fully-fledged development team akin to UAE Team Emirates, Red Bull and Visma-Lease a Bike. However, their local focus on the Vendée region may have to be compromised if the team ends up merging, especially if local expert Berneaudeau hangs up his managerial boots.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When could this all take place?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-43.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-43.webp 1800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-43-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-43-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-43-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-43-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-43-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-43-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-43-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-43-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-43-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Initial reports given by <em>Gazzetta dello Sport </em>in the winter hinted that Ineos Grenadiers would be looking to gain a new sponsor by July, in time for the Tour de France’s Grand Départ in Lille on Saturday 5th July. This has been slightly squashed in recent weeks, with a full rebrand now expected for 2026 when the next UCI points cycle starts. This gives some time for the ProTeam to decide on their future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, approval from TotalEnergies’ board would be needed for this deal to get over the line. The next meeting scheduled in Total’s books is at the end of this month, so the motion may be discussed when that takes place From there, we could expect rumours to pick up quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ineos Greandiers’ Allert has said that he aims to communicate any details on a deal as soon as they can. If this is signed off over the coming weeks, it may come before the Tour de France, with a full rebrand expected for next year. If the rumours are true, the squad would need to wait until the end of the season before switching its nationality to French. The extra months will also allow TotalEnergies to respect its deal with the ProTeam and grant them enough time to find a new sponsor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'tasty morsels sent straight to your inbox, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ineos-grenadiers-totalenergies-merger\">Ineos Grenadiers and TotalEnergies partnership: What we know so far</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"14707dd6aaa7c5f4341998f1d69afd54869cb8fa842cf3f357545e228eb30317","category":"Cycling"}
