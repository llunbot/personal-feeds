The Brave VPN subscription is priced at $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year, and with the new cross-platform functionality, it can be used on a total of five devices at once.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBrave's browser is designed to block ads and trackers for a more private browsing experience that prevents tracking across websites, but the Brave Firewall + VPN protects against trackers outside of the Brave browser as well. It blocks websites and apps from accessing IP address and location information, while the firewall portion of the service blocks trackers and \"other online nuisances.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBrave VPN subscribers can activate the service on Mac by opening up the Brave browser, going to the Settings menu, and toggling on the VPN.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe desktop VPN option is rolling out to users in various regions over the next few days, and Brave says that users should check back \"soon\" if it is not already available today. ‌iPhone‌ and Android users can log into their accounts and link more mobile or desktop devices.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/brave/\">Brave</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/13/brave-vpn-expands-to-desktop/\">Brave Browser's Firewall + VPN Service Expands to Desktop, Gains Cross-Platform Functionality</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/brave-browsers-firewall-vpn-service-expands-to-desktop-gains-cross-platform-functionality.2383598/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1d13adcc1069d085e271a2ca1cceb049d9210f2e5e3ac4cd5c0d1f63ef30cd48","category":"Apple"}
