The namesake 1995 game and its hugely popular 1996 <em>Red Alert</em> sequel require some older dependencies, like DirectX 5 and the Greenleaf Communications Library (for a full build and tool access) and the Borland Turbo Assembler (TASM 4.0) to compile. <em>Renegade </em>and <em>Generals</em>, however, call for a whole lot more nostalgia: STLport 4.5.3, the SafeDisk API, the GameSpy SDK, the RAD Miles Sound System SDK, and at least eight more.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/command-conquer-source-release-promises-more-mods-and-updates-for-rts-legend/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/command-conquer-source-release-promises-more-mods-and-updates-for-rts-legend/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d7febc669d2531998b13232dd0a223064bbba241a0363860b797be1777cd2830","category":"Tech"}
