But sustainability-minded cycling advocates like the Shift Cycling Culture collective have spent years looking, not just at how bikes can make the world better, but how our beloved bike industry can work better to bring us the cycling products we desire to experience the natural world around us, without harming that very environment.</p><p>At the same time, a separate focused COP26 Cycling industry initiative seeks to spread the word outside of bike enthusiasts, about how cycling can be a powerful tool to help combat climate change globally.</p><h2>Shift cycling industry, halt climate change</h2><div><p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/538326573?h=3930aa09df\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p><br>The Shift Cycling Culture mission comes down to the idea that by working together as an industry leadership forum to share resources and know-how, the cycling industry can work smarter. With proper planning and action, cycling companies can continue to make and sell new products so we can all enjoy riding bikes, while also reducing the negative impacts on the environment from material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, and their end-of-life disposal.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03131053/Prague-bike-path-commuting_bike-to-work-April-2020.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03131053/Prague-bike-path-commuting_bike-to-work-April-2020.jpg\" alt=\"Prague bike commuting, old school\" width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03131053/Prague-bike-path-commuting_bike-to-work-April-2020.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03131053/Prague-bike-path-commuting_bike-to-work-April-2020-297x178.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03131053/Prague-bike-path-commuting_bike-to-work-April-2020-800x480.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03131053/Prague-bike-path-commuting_bike-to-work-April-2020-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03131053/Prague-bike-path-commuting_bike-to-work-April-2020-768x461.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p>Their Climate Commitment continues to be one of the greatest steps the cycling industry has taken towards the Paris Agreement goals of reducing the environmental impact of delivering new bikes and cycling gear towards net-zero. The Shift Climate Commitment basically amounts to the industry transparently reporting on their Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by the end of 2023, and then setting in motion actions to cut those GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030 to hit the Paris targets.</p><p>The pledge has already been adopted by some heavy-hitters in the industry – including the CEOs of big-name bike companies like Specialized, Dorel Sports (Cannondale, GT, Schwinn, Mongoose, Charge <em>et al.</em>) Pon group (Cervélo, Santa Cruz, Julian, Focus, Derby, <em>et al.</em>), BMC, Brompton, Rapha, Assos, Selle Royal, Schwalbe, and many more.
