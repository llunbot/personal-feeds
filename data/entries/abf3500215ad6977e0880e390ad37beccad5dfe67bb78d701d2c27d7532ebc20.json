Attackers can then reconstruct them in a way that allows them to view the words or images displayed by the latter site. This leakage violates a critical security principle that forms one of the most fundamental security boundaries safeguarding the Internet. Known as the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy\">same origin policy</a>, it mandates that content hosted on one website domain be isolated from all other website domains.</p>\n<h2>Optimizing bandwidth at a cost</h2>\n<p>GPU.zip, as the proof-of-concept attack has been named, starts with a malicious website that places a link to the webpage it wants to read inside of an <a href=\"https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-iframe/\">iframe</a>, a common HTML element that allows sites to embed ads, images, or other content hosted on other websites. Normally, the same origin policy prevents either site from inspecting the source code, content, or final visual product of the other. The researchers found that data compression that both internal and discrete GPUs use to improve performance acts as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack\">side channel</a> that they can abuse to bypass the restriction and steal pixels one by one.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971213#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971213&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"abf3500215ad6977e0880e390ad37beccad5dfe67bb78d701d2c27d7532ebc20","category":"Tech"}
