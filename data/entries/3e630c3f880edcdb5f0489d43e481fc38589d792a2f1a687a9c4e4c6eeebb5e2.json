{"title":"Sandwich Launches Theater for Vision Pro (and Will Livestream The Talk Show Tomorrow)","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/10/sandwich-debuts-theater-for-vision-pro-with-exclusive-the-talk-show-live-event-in-immersive-video/","date":1718052633000,"content":"\n<p>Zac Hall, 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Earlier this year, Sandwich Vision introduced its first-ever app\nwith the debut of <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/television-the-future-of-tv/id6475739340\">Television</a>. The app lets you watch\ncontent on a range of virtual TV sets that you can pin in your\nreal-world environment through Vision Pro.</p>\n\n<p>Television supports viewing your own video files as well as\ncontent from YouTube. You can even watch Television with friends\nsynchronously over spatial FaceTime on Apple Vision Pro.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, though, you just want to enjoy a film in a proper movie\ntheater setting. What if you could do that for every movie? Enter\n<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/theater-the-future-of-cinema/id6502666560\">Theater</a>: the new Apple Vision Pro app that transports you\nto the perfect venue for movies.</p>\n\n<p>Theater will let you experience the theatrical cinema release\nfeeling (even if the original <em>Star Wars</em> film isn’t showing at\nyour local movie chain). Want to watch a movie at the same time\nwith friends or family who can’t be together in person? Spatial\nFaceTime makes that possible in Theater.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You know the immersive theater environments in Apple’s own TV app and Disney’s VisionOS app? Theater is like that, but for <em>any</em> video. It’s like watching YouTube on a 100-foot screen from the best seat in a cinema. I’ve been testing it, and it’s so great. I love it. And:</p>\n\n<p>Sandwich is collaborating with the duo at <a href=\"https://haloclinetech.com/\">SpatialGen</a>, Michael Butterfield and Zachary Handshoe. See their expertise on display as they produce the first-ever stereoscopic livestream of The Talk Show Live.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The studio is also collaborating with SpatialGen to livestream\nJohn Gruber’s The Talk Show Live in stereoscopically-captured 3D\nvideo using high-end cameras and lenses. [...]</p>\n\n<p>“I started to think ‘what if John’s audience that can’t be at the\nCalifornia Theater could join us anyway?’ That’s when I pitched\nthe idea to my co-developer, the genius Andy Roth,” Adam\n[Lisagor] says. “He loved it, he found SpatialGen, and I pitched\nthem the idea. And we had roughly 8 weeks to make this happen, and\nI can’t believe it all came together.”</p>\n\n<p>Live-streaming an event and making it look good in realtime is\nhard enough. But doing it in 3D video? That’s new territory,\nespecially considering Apple Vision Pro was just previewed at last\nyear’s WWDC and launched in the United States in February.</p>\n\n<p>“Gruber was fascinated by the idea but a little skeptical it\ncould work — it just seemed too ambitious,” Lisagor adds. “The\nworld’s first livestreamed 3D video event? In an immersive\ntheater environment? Admittedly seems like a pipe dream. But\nnope, it’s real.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To be clear, the <em>exclusive</em> way to watch the livestream will be through Theater on Vision Pro. Murphy’s Law willing, it should be pretty cool.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/10/sandwich-theater\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3e630c3f880edcdb5f0489d43e481fc38589d792a2f1a687a9c4e4c6eeebb5e2","category":"Tech"}
