Our unobtrusive and stylish \nsystem monitor showcased the features of Apple’s new OS and <a href=\"https://blog.iconfactory.com/2003/04/ipulse-gets-four-mice-plus-update/\">was a \nhit</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Now, two decades later, we’re happy to announce that \ngroundbreaking product is coming to iOS and iPadOS. And just as it \ndid with macOS, it’s taking a new approach with its user interface \nto get the job done. An app that can monitor your device is a \ngreat thing to have when you need it, but can get in the way when \nyou don’t. On iOS we solved this problem by using <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/multitask-with-picture-in-picture-iphcc3587b5d/ios\">Picture in \nPicture</a> technology. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>$10 one-time purchase in the App Store. That’s a great deal for a great tool. </p>\n\n<p>There are zillions of “system monitor”-type apps in the App Store. Good luck finding one that works well, is attractive and well-designed, and has no ads.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/13/ipulse-for-ios\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4930c04dda3c4386dff1f70d1c1fea3901d65dd0274fe7a0e0f5ae19f063577a","category":"Tech"}
