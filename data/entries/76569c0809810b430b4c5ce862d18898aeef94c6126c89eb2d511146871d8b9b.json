Google tried <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/chrome-abandoned-safari-like-redesign/\">something similar in 2016</a> for its own home-grown browser before canning the idea following negative user feedback. Microsoft had a similar browser interface design on Windows Phone, and even Firefox has played with a bottom address bar on Android. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThat said, Samsung's timing is a bit curious, coming in the wake of Apple's much-publicized and highly divisive Safari interface redesign. Apple made sweeping changes to Safari browser in ‌iOS 15‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a>, making numerous alterations to the organization and layout of tabs and other tools. Following a user backlash, Apple walked back the most controversial changes in successive betas, and made the position of the address bar <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-safari-design-changes-ios-15-beta-6/\">optional</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/\">Safari</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/03/samsung-follows-apple-and-lets-users-move-mobile-browser-address-bar-to-the-bottom-of-the-screen/\">Samsung Follows Apple and Lets Users Move Mobile Browser Address Bar to the Bottom of the Screen</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-follows-apple-and-lets-users-move-mobile-browser-address-bar-to-the-bottom-of-the-screen.2321543/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=2hcaRQ6ReBg:4DsHPc9FiMw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=2hcaRQ6ReBg:4DsHPc9FiMw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/2hcaRQ6ReBg\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"76569c0809810b430b4c5ce862d18898aeef94c6126c89eb2d511146871d8b9b","category":"Apple"}
