That weight pertains to the Skinwall tire; the Black sidewall tire has a claimed weight of 820g. Both have an ETRTO of 59-622, aimed at 28-35mm internal rims, and run a foldable Kevlar bead. The added width means this tire is actually almost 100g heavier than the original 29″ x 2.25″ Onza Svelt.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/onza-svelt-xc-tire-tread-pattern-fast-rolling-low-profile-lugs.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/onza-svelt-xc-tire-tread-pattern-fast-rolling-low-profile-lugs-800x1200.jpg\" alt=\"onza svelt xc tire fast rolling tread dry hard pack trails\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/onza-svelt-xc-tire-tread-pattern-fast-rolling-low-profile-lugs-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/onza-svelt-xc-tire-tread-pattern-fast-rolling-low-profile-lugs-200x300.jpg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/onza-svelt-xc-tire-tread-pattern-fast-rolling-low-profile-lugs-80x120.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/onza-svelt-xc-tire-tread-pattern-fast-rolling-low-profile-lugs-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/onza-svelt-xc-tire-tread-pattern-fast-rolling-low-profile-lugs-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/onza-svelt-xc-tire-tread-pattern-fast-rolling-low-profile-lugs-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/onza-svelt-xc-tire-tread-pattern-fast-rolling-low-profile-lugs.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Onza Svelt maintains the very same tread pattern it was launched with at <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/soc16-onza-svelt-mountain-bike-tire-smooths-xc-rough/\" target=\"_blank\">Sea Otter back in 2016</a>. That sees a repeating set of three pairs of center tread blocks, with neighbors tapering narrower, followed by a single block, to form a series of arrows down the center. All are ramped to reduce rolling resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ONZA-svelt-v2-edge-tread-45a-rubber.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ONZA-svelt-v2-edge-tread-45a-rubber-800x534.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ONZA-svelt-v2-edge-tread-45a-rubber-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ONZA-svelt-v2-edge-tread-45a-rubber-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ONZA-svelt-v2-edge-tread-45a-rubber-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ONZA-svelt-v2-edge-tread-45a-rubber-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ONZA-svelt-v2-edge-tread-45a-rubber-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ONZA-svelt-v2-edge-tread-45a-rubber-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ONZA-svelt-v2-edge-tread-45a-rubber.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the edge, we see two types of knobs; one squared off and siped for added flex, and another more rectangular, buttressed for support. Between the center tread and edge knobs are some intermediate blocks, presumably to aid the transition of grip to the edge during cornering.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Onza-Canis-revamped-versatile-fast-XC-light-trail-mountain-bike-tire_tech-details.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"328\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Onza-Canis-revamped-versatile-fast-XC-light-trail-mountain-bike-tire_tech-details-800x328.jpg\" alt=\"Onza Canis revamped versatile fast XC light trail mountain bike tire, construction tech details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Onza-Canis-revamped-versatile-fast-XC-light-trail-mountain-bike-tire_tech-details-800x328.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Onza-Canis-revamped-versatile-fast-XC-light-trail-mountain-bike-tire_tech-details-297x122.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Onza-Canis-revamped-versatile-fast-XC-light-trail-mountain-bike-tire_tech-details-120x49.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Onza-Canis-revamped-versatile-fast-XC-light-trail-mountain-bike-tire_tech-details-768x315.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Onza-Canis-revamped-versatile-fast-XC-light-trail-mountain-bike-tire_tech-details-1536x630.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Onza-Canis-revamped-versatile-fast-XC-light-trail-mountain-bike-tire_tech-details.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the Canis, the updated Svelt runs the XCC Casing. It is very basic in its construction, composed simply of a single-ply of 60 TPI material with no puncture or sidewall support to speak of. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the former Onza Svelt was composed of a 55a/65a rubber, the new Svelt gets their 60 Medium Compound 60 – a combination of 60a and 45a durometer rubbers, a change that will likely enhance grip. The softer 45a rubber makes up the edge of the tread, while the harder, faster rolling 60a rubber makes up the center tread.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Onza Svelt XC &amp; Marathon tire is available now in Europe and the US at the following prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Color</td><td>Size</td><td>ETRTO</td><td>Casing</td><td>Claimed Weight</td><td>€ EUR</td><td>$ USD</td></tr><tr><td>Black</td><td>29″ x 2.3″</td><td>59-622</td><td>1-ply 60 TPI</td><td>820 grams</td><td>64,90 €</td><td>$69.90</td></tr><tr><td>Skin Wall</td><td>29″ x 2.3″</td><td>59-622</td><td>1-ply 60 TPI</td><td>780 grams</td><td>69,90 €</td><td>$74.90</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.onza-tires.com/en-gb\" target=\"_blank\">onza-tires.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/onza-svelt-xc-race-tire-goes-to-29-x-2-3-with-softer-compounds/\">Onza Svelt XC Race Tire Goes to 29″ x 2.3″ with Softer Compounds</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"575c11c74f3b344e3f0482a00429a32abc18219fd3224743cbc9ecf01878a5b7","category":"Cycling"}
