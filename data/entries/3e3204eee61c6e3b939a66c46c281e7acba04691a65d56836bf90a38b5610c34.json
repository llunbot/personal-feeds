It includes Mac-specific Command and Option keys and supports connectivity via Bluetooth or 2.4GHz wireless, with battery life rated at up to 266 hours on a single charge.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, Corsair's M75 Wireless mouse features an ambidextrous design weighing 89 grams and includes a 26K DPI Marksman optical sensor. The mouse connects via Bluetooth or Corsair's proprietary Slipstream wireless technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth peripherals can be customized through Corsair's iCUE software, which is now available for macOS, allowing users to adjust key assignments, lighting effects, and other settings. However, according to <em><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/hands-on-apples-corsair-gaming-keyboard-and-mouse-2000525304\">Gizmodo</a></em>, the keyboard requires the use of a bundled USB-C to USB-A converter from Anker to connect it to new Macs that don't come with legacy USB-A ports, so that's something to keep in mind.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Frost versions of the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRYS2ZM/A/corsair-k65-plus-wireless-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-for-mac-glacier-blue\">K65 Plus Wireless keyboard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRYU2ZM/A/corsair-m75-wireless-lightweight-rgb-gaming-mouse-glacier-blue\">M75 Wireless mouse</a> are available now through Apple's online store, priced at $179.95 and $129.95 respectively.
