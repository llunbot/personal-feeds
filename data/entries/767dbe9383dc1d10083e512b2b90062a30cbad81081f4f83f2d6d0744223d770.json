{"title":"iOS 17.1 is coming this week to fix everything wrong with your iPhone","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2112046/ios-17-1-fixes-significant-location-incoming-calls-image-persistence.html","date":1697991314000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the release of a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2084154/ios-17-1-beta-release-date-new-features.html\">second release candidate</a> late last week, Apple will launch the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2084154/ios-17-1-beta-release-date-new-features.html\">first major update to iOS 17</a> on Monday or Tuesday. While early iOS updates usually bring a slew of new features, this update will only bring a couple of small improvements to AirDrop and Apple Music. But the biggest reason to rush to update will be numerous bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple already fixed a couple of widespread issues with a flurry of small <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">updates to iOS 17</a>, but this release will fix numerous nagging bugs that have afflicted new and old iPhones alike. Among the fixes, according to Apple’s release notes, are the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes an issue that may cause the Significant Location privacy setting to reset when transferring an Apple Watch or pairing it for the first time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Resolves an issue where the names of incoming callers may not appear when you are on another call.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Addresses an issue where custom and purchased ringtones may not appear as options for your text tone.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fixes an issue that may cause the keyboard to be less responsive.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fixes an issue that may cause display image persistence.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That last fix is the most notable, as numerous reports around the web have claimed “burn-in” issues with the iPhone 15. Some have swapped out their devices at Apple Stores only to have the same issue pop up. Burn-in is possible with OLED displays but rarely happens after only a few weeks of use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple still has several iOS 17 features yet to be released, including the new Journal app, but it’s good that iOS 17.1 will be more of a maintenance update. Since iOS 17 launched in September, there have been countless reports of problems, a handful of which were fixed with the iOS 17.0.1, 17.0.2, and 17.0.3 updates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been reported that another widespread issue, where phones are randomly restarting overnight, has not been fixed as of the latest beta. It’s possible that Apple will quickly push a smaller iOS 17.1.1 to address that bug. </p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"767dbe9383dc1d10083e512b2b90062a30cbad81081f4f83f2d6d0744223d770","category":"Apple"}
