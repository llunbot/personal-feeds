{"title":"Overriding Gatekeeper Protections in MacOS 15 Sequoia Will Require Clicking Through Panels in System Settings","link":"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=saqachfa","date":1723084847000,"content":"\n<p>Here’s a developer note from Apple confirming another change in MacOS 15 that many of us were hoping was a bug or glitch in the developer betas:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In macOS Sequoia, users will no longer be able to Control-click to\noverride Gatekeeper when opening software that isn’t signed\ncorrectly or notarized. They’ll need to visit System Settings &gt;\nPrivacy &amp; Security to review security information for software\nbefore allowing it to run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why? Is there any evidence that the Control-clicking shortcut was insufficient? If so, what is that evidence? It seems to me that the sort of technically unsophisticated non-expert users whom these features are meant to protect are the same users who have no idea the Control-click shortcut to launch non-notarized apps even exists.</p>\n\n<p>I mean, if there are exploits running wild because unsophisticated Mac users are Control-clicking malware apps they’ve somehow downloaded, where are they? I can only see two possible explanations for <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/07/mac-os-15-sequoia-gatekeeper\">these changes</a>: (a) these decisions that are making MacOS increasingly annoying for expert and power users are being made by cover-your-ass bureaucrats for no good reason, and no one who knows better is shooting them down within Apple; or (b) there’s a serious rash of unreported abuse of these features and Apple is too timid to publicize them to justify the increased frequency and arduousness of these permission nags, lest they admit the Mac has any problems at all.</p>\n\n<p>Neither is a good look.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/07/mac-os-15-sequoia-gatekeeper\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dee5f26dd5e5c3f571cf540b14e1b002347f675d46cebe0c04114985edd3b4f3","category":"Tech"}
