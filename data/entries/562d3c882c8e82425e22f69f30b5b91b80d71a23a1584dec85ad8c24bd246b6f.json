As spotted by <a href=\"https://www.techpowerup.com/318628/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3050-6gb-formally-launched\">TechPowerUp</a>, Nvidia partners like <a href=\"https://www.gigabyte.com/Press/News/2146\">Gigabyte</a> have begun officially announcing a 6GB version of the old <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/01/nvidia-rtx-3050-review-for-an-overpriced-1080p-gpu-this-couldve-been-worse/\">RTX 3050</a> graphics card, albeit with less memory and memory bandwidth, fewer CUDA cores, and lower power requirements.</p>\n<p>The announcement follows a few days of leaked retail listings, which generally point to an MSRP of roughly $179 for the new-old card. This would make it Nvidia's first sub-$200 graphics card launch since the GeForce GTX 1650 Super came out in late 2019, a four-year gap caused partially by a cryptocurrency- and pandemic-fueled GPU shortage that lasted from late 2020 into mid-to-late 2022.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000798#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000798&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"562d3c882c8e82425e22f69f30b5b91b80d71a23a1584dec85ad8c24bd246b6f","category":"Tech"}
