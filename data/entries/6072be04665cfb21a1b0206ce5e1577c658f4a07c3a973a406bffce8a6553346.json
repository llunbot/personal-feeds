This information was previously hidden in the General &gt; About section of the Settings app. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Charging Optimization section continues to provide the same settings. Optimized Battery Charging preserves battery health by learning usage habits and limiting the amount of time that the battery sits at a 100 percent charge. There is also an option to limit charging to 80 percent to further preserve health, and a toggle for turning off optimized charging all together.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that these changes are limited to the ‌iPhone 15‌, ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max. Battery settings have not changed on older <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/ios-17-4-iphone-15-battery/\">iOS 17.4 Lets You See Your iPhone 15 Battery Health at a Glance</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-lets-you-see-your-iphone-15-battery-health-at-a-glance.2419984/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6072be04665cfb21a1b0206ce5e1577c658f4a07c3a973a406bffce8a6553346","category":"Apple"}
