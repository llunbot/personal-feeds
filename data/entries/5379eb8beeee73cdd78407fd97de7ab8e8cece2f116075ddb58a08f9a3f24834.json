Invitations went out to press this morning, and marketing SVP Greg Joswiak <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1435272731746979840\">tweeted</a> a short video teasing the event as well.</p>\n<p>You can see the image and copy that accompanied the invitation above. As usual, the invitation doesn't reveal much about what to expect. It does note that the event will be an online video stream and not an in-person gathering.</p>\n<p>That said, we know more or less what to expect. Apple has held an event like this during the same week every year for a while now, and the announcements have always focused primarily on two products: the iPhone and the Apple Watch. This year, rumors abound of an updated version of Apple's AirPods wireless earbuds, too.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792418#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792418&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5379eb8beeee73cdd78407fd97de7ab8e8cece2f116075ddb58a08f9a3f24834","category":"Tech"}
