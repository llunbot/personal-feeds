In fact, he said, his team used a new detection method to measure that the rate of satellite trails is <i>doubling</i>. But Stark was presenting his team’s idea for a Band-Aid fix: new software they described in a <a href=\"https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/acs/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/isr2208.pdf\">recent report</a> that is five to 10 times more sensitive at finding trails than previous software, and then masking them out. “It’s particularly good at finding satellite trails that can be missed by eye,” he said.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947734#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947734&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"13e07c0782d4f44733ba22d6051d9383f74797d0693d047d7e0f3e812ba4c73e","category":"Tech"}
