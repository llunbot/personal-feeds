It kept the “iPhone 8” design with its Home button and small form factor that appeals to some, but the aging design and minimal upgrades meant the new iPhone SE was coolly received by the masses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone SE is in desperate need of a big upgrade, and if you are wondering whether there be a new iPhone SE, it looks like a new model—maybe with a brand new name—could arrive very soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tim Cook has <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2608238/apple-to-release-newest-member-of-the-family-on-february-19.html\">teased</a> that “the newest member of the family” is coming on Wednesday, February 19. This is widely expected to be a replacement for the iPhone SE. Here’s what to expect from a big resign to AI capable specs and price hikes.  </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPhone SE release date: When is the new iPhone SE coming out?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>An X post from Apple’s CEO Tim Cook hints that the iPhone SE 4 will launch on February 19.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Otherwise, a launch at a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">Spring Apple Event</a> is expected.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s Tim Cook has ‘<a href=\"https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1890068457825394918\">tweeted</a>‘ on X: “Get ready to meet the newest member of the family” on February 19. That means a launch of something is imminent, which is likely the iPhone SE.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Days earlier, rumor-monger extraordinaire, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2605710/iphone-se-4-launch-pushed-to-next-week-but-something-smaller-is-coming-today.html\">initially said</a> the iPhone SE 4 would launch in the week of February 10, claimed we can expect the new iPhone SE to launch in the week of February 17, 2025. Gurman is saying that the iPhone SE will be included in product briefings being organized by Apple that week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an iPhone SE isn’t the mystery new family member coming on February 19, an update is expected soon, and there is precedence for Apple to launch the iPhone SE in March or April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s iPhone SE doesn’t follow the same predictable annual release schedule as the standard iPhone line, and it doesn’t tend to have its release party in September like that handset. There tend to be much longer intervals between updates too. But one thing seems sure: The iPhone SE tends to be updated in March or April. Here’s when the three models released so far made their debut:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/624052/iphone-se-2022-review.html\">iPhone SE (3rd gen)</a>: March 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668001/iphone-se-2020-review.html\">iPhone SE (2nd gen)</a>: April 2020</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667407/iphone-se-review.html\">iPhone SE (1st gen)</a>: March 2016</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Which-iPhone-do-I-have-iPhone-SE-2022.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Front panel of the iPhone SE 3rd Generation\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Which-iPhone-do-I-have-iPhone-SE-2022.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Which-iPhone-do-I-have-iPhone-SE-2022.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Which-iPhone-do-I-have-iPhone-SE-2022.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Which-iPhone-do-I-have-iPhone-SE-2022.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Which-iPhone-do-I-have-iPhone-SE-2022.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Which-iPhone-do-I-have-iPhone-SE-2022.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Which-iPhone-do-I-have-iPhone-SE-2022.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Apple’s current budget phone, the iPhone SE launched in 2022.</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What will the new iPhone SE be called? SE 4 or iPhone 16E?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While we assumed Apple would continue the iPhone SE for another generation, a rumor in January 2025 claims that Apple will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2566898/the-iphone-se-4-might-not-be-so-special-after-all.html\">introduce a new name</a>: iPhone 16E. That name would align it with the current generation and also could indicate an annual upgrade cycle. It may also mean that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 are removed from the lineup, or that the price of the iPhone 16E is more than the iPhone 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPhone SE price: How much will the iPhone SE 4 cost?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone SE currently from: $429/£429. New price could be $499 or more. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While the iPhone SE is Apple’s cheapest iPhone, it is possible we could see pricing increase with the arrival of the new model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Higher component pricing and the effect of higher import duties is likely to lead to higher prices for consumers wishing to purchase the new iPhone SE. Additionally, the 2025 iPhone SE may also no longer be positioned as the ‘budget’ option, depending on how Apple places it in the line up related to the iPhone 15.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some rumors claim the 4th-gen iPhone SE could start at $499, which while more than the current price, would still be less expensive than any other new iPhone Apple sells.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Apple tends to have a $100 jump between handsets, with the iPhone 16 starting at $799 and the iPhone 15 at $699. If the iPhone SE replaces the iPhone 14 in the lineup, it could mean a $599 starting price. That’s assuming that the new iPhone SE doesn’t replace the iPhone 15 at a $699 starting price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, Apple won’t push up the price that much. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman claims the next model is intended to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2475634/the-iphone-se-4-will-bring-back-the-notch-kill-the-home-button.html\">help Apple compete with low-end Android phones in China</a>, so a low price would be necessary to achieve this plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Will Apple adjust pricing due to exchange rates? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the iPhone SE (3rd generation) was released in 2022, Apple added a chunk onto the cost, making the current model somewhat less desirable than previous iterations, especially when you factor in the measly amount of storage that comes with the baseline model. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time prices were even higher in the U.K. but, in September 2023, after adjusting for inflation, Apple dropped the U.K. price back to match the U.S. price. Apple did the same thing for prices in euros in September 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company may be about to undo this positive price change. It seems likely that even if prices don’t chance in the U.S. price hikes will happen in the U.K. The pound has fallen against the dollar in recent months, and it is therefore likely that we will see some pricing adjustments correlating with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672257/apple-price-rises-uk-apple-brexit-price-hike-iphones-macbooks-apps-go-up.html\">Apple’s price hikes in the U.K. in January 2017</a>. So the current like-for-like pricing is unlikely to continue. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How much did previous generations of iPhone SE cost?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><br /></td><td>32GB</td><td>64GB</td><td>128GB</td><td>256GB</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone SE (3rd gen, 2022)</td><td><br /></td><td>$429/£429 (was £449 at launch)</td><td>$479/£479 (was £499 at launch)</td><td>$579/£579 (was £609 at launch)</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone SE (2nd gen, 2020)</td><td><br /></td><td>$399/£419</td><td>$449/£469</td><td>$549/£569</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone SE (1st gen, 2016)</td><td>$399/£379</td><td><br /></td><td>$499/£449</td><td><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>How the prices of the iPhone SE have changed over the past generations.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPhone SE design: What will the new iPhone SE look like?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Will the iPhone SE get a long-overdue design revamp? Rumors suggest that we could see a move away from the iPhone 8 chassis to something more like modern iPhones, with Face ID and a full-screen display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That could be good or bad news, depending on your viewpoint. Some people prefer the Home button as a means to interact with their iPhone, for some older people and those who are less dexterous it is helpful to have a physical button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors have long claimed the iPhone SE 4 will be based on the iPhone 14, the last iPhone to have a notch. However, there are suggestions that the new iPhone SE could take it’s design lead from the iPhone 15 and feature a Dynamic Island. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Touch ID or Face ID?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks very likely that the new iPhone SE will use Face ID. That means Touch ID, which has been a staple of the SE line since its debut, will go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A notch or not? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No Home button is likely to mean a notch (where the Face ID sensors reside), but it could also mean a Dynamic Island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A report on January 21, 2025, by leaker Evan Blass states that the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2583113/new-leak-changes-everything-we-know-about-the-iphone-se-4.html\">iPhone SE will have a Dynamic Island</a> and not a notch. Apple first introduced the notch with the iPhone 14 Pro followed by the iPhone 15 a year later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, a later X post on January 29, 2025, this time from Ross Young, a displays analyst, <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://x.com/dsccross/status/1884326503393214966&amp;xcust=1-1-2591605-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2591605/the-new-iphone-se-will-have-a-notch-after-all.html\" target=\"_blank\">stated</a> “Notch like iPhone 14 is correct.” Young has a very strong track record for display rumors as he relies on supply chain reports rather than leaks. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2591605/the-new-iphone-se-will-have-a-notch-after-all.html\">The new iPhone SE will have a notch after all</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A rumor back in July 2024 suggested Apple would change course with the iPhone SE 4 and instead use <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2405302/iphone-se-4-rumor-chassis-iphone-16.html\">the same body as the iPhone 16</a>, making it a true budget version of the latest iPhone lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPhone SE camera: One of two? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the defining features of the iPhone SE is a single camera on the back. This is probably not going to change, although if the new iPhone SE does adopt the chassis of an iPhone 14 or 16 it is possible. Rumors suggest a single 48MP camera, which would at least give the iPhone SE 4 a good 2x “optical zoom” mode using the center 12MP of the sensor, as the iPhone 16 does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple chooses to use the chassis of the iPhone 16 rather than the iPhone 14 that could allow the best alignment of two camera lenses for talking videos for the Vision Pro. But that would mean that the iPhone SE would have two cameras on the back, rather than just one, as it does currently. It would also make it hard to differentiate between models, pushing some users who might otherwise consider the iPhone 16 to buy the iPhone SE 4 at a lower price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We got our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2579700/iphone-se-4-dummy-model-reveals-key-features-of-apples-next-budget-phone.html\">first look at a “dummy model”</a> for the new iPhone SE in January from leaker Sonny Dickson, and it definitely looks like an iPhone 14 with a single rear camera.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-se-4-dummy-leak.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Sonny Dickson X post shoeing dummy models of the iPhone SE 4\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-se-4-dummy-leak.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-se-4-dummy-leak.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-se-4-dummy-leak.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-se-4-dummy-leak.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-se-4-dummy-leak.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-se-4-dummy-leak.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-se-4-dummy-leak.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-se-4-dummy-leak.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Sonny Dickson/X</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone SE 4 specs: Will Apple Intelligence be supported?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhones launched in 2024 were all about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a> AI features, which first arrived with iOS 18.1 and will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369986/apple-intelligence-siri-features-coming-after-ios-18-launch.html\">continue to get new features in iOS 18 updates</a>. It is therefore likely that when the new iPhone SE (or iPhone 16E) launches, it will support Apple Intelligence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, one of the biggest new features, a massive expansion of Siri capabilities, is due for release in iOS 18.4 around the same time the iPhone SE 4 is expected to be released.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Processor &amp; RAM</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2407667/iphone-se-perfect-apple-intelligence-device-spring-2025.html\">run Apple Intelligence</a> an iPhone requires an A17 Pro or A18 chip and 8GB of RAM. There is some expectation that the iPhone SE 4 could meet these requirements. It is common for the iPhone SE to have the same processor as the latest non-Pro iPhone but skimp on other features to differentiate itself, so we expect the iPhone SE 4 to have the A18 processor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5G modem</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone SE 4 might be the first iPhone to feature <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2548331/apples-first-5g-modem-will-kick-off-a-3-year-plan-to-leave-qualcomm-behind.html\">Apple’s own 5G modems</a> (codenamed Sinope). It will offer sub-6 support but no mmWave, and lower performance than Qualcomm’s best 5G modems but better power efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is also about to switch over to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2555406/apple-is-about-to-switch-to-its-own-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-chip.html\">its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a>, codenamed Proxima. The rumors say this chip will actually appear first in a refreshed HomePod mini and Apple TV, but there’s a chance it could be used in the iPhone SE 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Storage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the iPhone 13 range moving to a baseline of 128GB (and the 14-series handsets following suit), it’s hoped that the new iPhone SE might do likewise, as 64GB isn’t enough for most users anymore, especially since system files take up more than 10GB (and you can add a multi-gigabyte Apple Intelligence model to that).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there have been reports that iPhone users are opting to use iCloud, rather than spending more on an iPhone with more storage. So it may still be the case that 64GB is adequate. And by keeping the 64GB version Apple may still be able to offer an iPhone SE for $499. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2593366/study-fewer-iphone-users-are-springing-for-storage-upgrades.html\">Study: Fewer iPhone users are springing for storage upgrades</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no good rumors one way or the other about the minimum storage for the iPhone SE 4. However, since Apple has upped the entry-level storage in the iPad mini from 64GB to 128GB it may follow suit with the iPhone SE 4 (we hope so). </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>USB-C</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect the iPhone SE 4 to feature a USB-C port for charging, as all new iPhones do, and IP68 water resistance. The current SE is one of the last remaining Apple devices to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1341317/lightning-usb-c-iphone-ipad-airpods-magic-keyboard-mouse-trackpad.html\">still have a Lightning port</a>. Apple has been forced to stop selling the iPhone SE and 14 and 14 Plus in the EU because of the use of the Lightning port, so it would be illogical if it had anything other than USB-C.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Action Button</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2488725/button-less-case-leak-spills-key-details-of-next-iphone-se.html\">alleged leak of an iPhone SE 4 case</a> shows a cutout for the mute switch rather than an Action Button, and of course, there will be no Camera Control button—if the iPhone SE 4 had these features there would be little reason for anyone to buy an iPhone 16!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone history</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 16 range and the iPhone SE 3 are the current-generation models available from Apple. In addition to this SE 4 model, we’re also expecting iPhone 17 to launch in 2025. Below you can find links to our reviews of all iPhone models, including the latest generation.
