Times have changed compared to that first 1992 Manitou fork. Reverse Arch tech and much bigger stanchions mean so much more stiffness that it can’t even be compared. Anywhere between 110-150mm of plush travel out of the same fork almost seems inconceivable – with simple travel adjust spacers inside. And 29er rollover… can you believe we used to ride 26″ wheels?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, this new Mattoc Pro is worlds away from what Manitou had us riding 30 years ago. But we can still build up a beautiful modern trail mountain bike with old school black and chrome looks…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Manitou Mattoc Pro old school Ltd.

But thanks to Manitou’s simple travel spacers, even shade tree home bike mechanics can easily set it up with anywhere between 110mm XC to 150mm all-mountain travel thanks to the simple 10mm travel spacers. That means pretty much any trail bike can get a blast from the past with classy old school black &amp; polished alloy looks, matched with modern stiffness and damping.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_sideways.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_sideways-800x400.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Manitou Mattoc Pro LE, limited edition old school modern 110-150mm all-mountain bike fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_sideways-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_sideways-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_sideways-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_sideways-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_sideways-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_sideways.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pro-level Mattoc features a top-tier, lightweight  Dorado Air spring with self-balancing positive &amp; negative chambers and external bleeder screws.

Starting out at 140mm or up to 150mm travel (but quite a bit if you want to set it as short as 110mm). Manitou claims the reverse arch adds up to 13% extra stiffness with no extra weight. Thus, they boost the ability to have such a wide range of travel out of a single platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Manitou Mattoc Pro LE Retro – Pricing &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_angled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_angled-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Manitou Mattoc Pro LE, limited edition old school modern 110-150mm all-mountain bike fork, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_angled-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_angled-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_angled-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_angled-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_angled-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_angled-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Manitou-Mattoc-Pro-Ltd-LE_modern-all-mountain-MTB-suspension-fork-with-old-school-vibes_angled.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The limited edition retro Manitou Mattoc Pro fork sells for $1100.
