It’s all the above and more. It’s the Master of None by Bender Bicycle Co.With a nod to Fort Collins, where Bender is based, and the bike style favored by every local, it harmoniously fuses vintage visuals with contemporary elements. What caught our eye were the silver components, the fenderz, and casual lines.

Scorchers aren’t anything new to the niche framebuilding world. Fixed gear, dirt-oriented bikes date back to the genesis of fixed drivetrains, but those bikes of olden times didn’t look anything like this Black Cat Bicycles. Todd threw his signature fillet brazed and bi-lam construction techniques at this bike, complete with swoopy seat stays, at-home-cooked-up paint schemes, and a lot of clever problem-solving. By utilizing a <a href=\"https://www.squidbikes.com/products/oner-pf30-eccentric-bottom-bracket\" target=\"_blank\">Squid Oner PF30 EBB</a>, his client would get proper chain tension, even under all the torque generated by fixed gear riding.

This bike designed to take on the Colorado Trail, is stunningly clad in a durable powder coat fade, dons hints of vernacular notes ranging from the Penstemon plant and the almighty American Buffalo. This size XS/S hardtail was designed for a shorter rider with a 28” inseam and features a Columbus MTB downtube, inverted to give extra space at the bottom bracket cluster, optimizing every inch for a large framebag.

Designed for a rider with a low inseam, this may look like a dirt jumper but is a custom, rigid, singlespeed MTB. Tom designed and fabricated the unique track end dropouts, his signature “Capp” fork, and he custom formed the chain and seat stays to have the same profile and a matching brake and seat stay bridge. We were really impressed with this bike as it exemplifies the potential for all riders of all sizes to be able to experience both beauty and functionality via a custom bicycle.

Darren Larkin brought a prototype bike to the frame builder showcase. A true “just for me” creation that embodies the true nature of design ideation. The bike features a carbon fiber seat tube, custom lugs, a custom machined top headset cup, an integrated lower headset cup on the 1” head tube, a custom steerer tube to facilitate this, butted 3/4” chain stays, and custom lugs to strengthen the flat mount brake mounting. This size 59cm bike weighs a scant 22lbs and features approximately $200 worth of used parts that still have many years of life ahead of them.

The Fort Collins, CO fabricator and artist is consistently cranking out wild frame, fork, and handlebar designs and always brings fire builds to bike shows. This year marks his tenth year building bikes under the Oddity mark and, to commemorate the important occasion, he built a single speed mountain bike that is equal parts retrospective and contemporary in that he started building in chromoly steel and eventually graduated to using titanium. For this bike, he combined the two materials into the style Oddity is known for with house-shaped tubes, a single crown truss (Squid) fork, and the original handmade moto-style handmade handlebar, the Oddmone. Steel and titanium aren’t directly weldable, so Burnesey worked with Oakes Manufacturing to build a two-part titanimum/steel tube splitter enabling the use of both materials on the build signifying a love for one-speed and Oddity’s timeless style and modern performance.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-SaltAir-Single-Speed-MTB-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-SaltAir-Single-Speed-MTB-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-SaltAir-Single-Speed-MTB-1.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-SaltAir-Single-Speed-MTB-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-SaltAir-Single-Speed-MTB-1.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-SaltAir-Single-Speed-MTB-1.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-SaltAir-Single-Speed-MTB-1.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-SaltAir-Single-Speed-MTB-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.saltaircycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SaltAir Rigid Singlespeed MTB</a></h3>\n<p>We recently featured a wild build from SaltAir Cycles that received a lot of positive feedback – <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/saltair-cycles-twentysixie-fixed-gear-mtb/\" target=\"_blank\">Clint’s Twentysixie Fixed Gear MTB</a> – and builder Matt Nelson is here at MADE with some other super fun creations.

Fixed gear stage race around a volcano? Yes, please. 230-mile gravel ride through the desert? I am f*cking there. After a few years as a welder/fabricator for other bike manufacturers along the front range of CO, I started Significant Other Bikes; a place for me to explore, play and create that which brings me the most joy as a cyclist: all terrain adventure bikes.</em></p>\n<p><em>For Made, I took inspiration from my first bike and work fixie; re-imagining, designing and fabricating it as I would have loved for it to have been: a light, wide-tired ride with wide bars and a buttery smooth pedal stroke. Edgy without being intimidating. A bike capable of ripping a work day over the bridges in the snow with confidence, and equally as capable of spending a day off exploring Rockaway Beach.</em></p>\n<p><em>I kept the fixed gear drivetrain and road cranks, but updated the clearances to allow for a combination of 42mm tires and a 40T chainring. Using 3D-modeling software to draw out my ideas allowed me to design and print a custom yoke which provided for a healthy amount of space for All The Things. Custom drawn and laser cut dropouts coupled with custom-designed and printed chain and seat stay plugs rounded out the rear triangle. With the exception of the speed holes, I kept the front triangle relatively straightforward. The speed holes were placed in the seat tube as a personal challenge and as a nod to another fabricator I admire and a show bike of theirs. And, hey, you can fit your U-Lock through it! But I’m sorry, I will never do those again!</em></p>\n<p><em>The frame and Sig-O components are all TIG welded titanium, with frame paint by Flux Customs and Sig-O components finish by Mara at Metal Ink.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-LaMarche-Rigid-2622-MTB-31.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-LaMarche-Rigid-2622-MTB-31.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-LaMarche-Rigid-2622-MTB-31.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-LaMarche-Rigid-2622-MTB-31.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-LaMarche-Rigid-2622-MTB-31.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-LaMarche-Rigid-2622-MTB-31.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-LaMarche-Rigid-2622-MTB-31.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/2023-MADE-Bike-Show-LaMarche-Rigid-2622-MTB-31.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>We’ll be back tomorrow with another stacked gallery of bikes from MADE, so stay tuned!</p>\n<p>Let us know your favorite in the comments!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Thanks to 1-Up USA for supporting our continued coverage of the 2023 MADE Bike Show.
