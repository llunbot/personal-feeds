We are excited to bring this experience to even more users with today's rollout in Australia,\" said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Services. \"The map has been rebuilt from the ground up, with better navigation, richer detail, more accurate information for places, and remarkable features that only Apple can deliver, like Look Around, Share ETA, and more. Now it is easier than ever for users to find the places they love and get to where they're going.\"</blockquote>Apple Maps users in Australia can access features like lane guidance, speed camera alerts, information about accidents and road hazards, accident reporting, and the Share ETA feature.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has been working to expand its updated Maps experience worldwide after first introducing the new look in iOS 13.
