The European Championships week has come to an end, resulting in new jerseys for several riders including the Netherlands‚Äô Lorena Wiebes and Tim Merlier of Belgium in the elite road races. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time-trial victories went to Belgium‚Äôs Lotte Kopecky and Italy‚Äôs Edoardo Affini, and Affini picked up a second jersey by being part of the winning Italian team in the mixed relay, alongside Mattia Cattaneo, Elena Cecchini, Vittoria Guazzini, Mirco Maestri and Gaia Masetti.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Lorena Wiebes sprints to second European jersey</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"776\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Lorena-Wiebes-UEC-776x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Lorena-Wiebes-UEC-776x970.jpg 776w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Lorena-Wiebes-UEC-240x300.jpg 240w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Lorena-Wiebes-UEC-768x960.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Lorena-Wiebes-UEC-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Lorena-Wiebes-UEC-750x938.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Lorena-Wiebes-UEC-1140x1425.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Lorena-Wiebes-UEC.jpg 1440w\" /><figcaption>UEC - Limburg2024</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The elite women‚Äôs 162km road race came down to a sprint finish between the Netherlands, Poland, Italy and France. But once Dutchwoman Lorena Wiebes got her head in the wind, there was no stopping her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Launching her sprint in the final 200m, Wiebes catapulted to the front and remained there with an unmatchable power. Since the modern revamp of the European Championships in 2016, she is the only woman to double up after previously winning in 2022. Italy‚Äôs Elisa Balsamo finished second with Poland‚Äôs Daria Pikulik in third.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Belgium‚Äôs Lotte Kopecky won the elite women‚Äôs time-trial, ending the three-year reign of Switzerland‚Äôs Marlen Reusser. Kopecky beat the Netherlands‚Äô Ellen van Dijk by 44 seconds.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/european-championships-2018\">Flashback Friday: The first unified, multi-sport European Championships in 2018</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/european-championships-limburg\">Limburg, home of the 2024 European Championships and cycling in Flanders</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Tim Merlier comes out on top</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Tim-Merlier-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Tim-Merlier-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Tim-Merlier-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Tim-Merlier-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Tim-Merlier-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Tim-Merlier-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Tim-Merlier-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Tim-Merlier-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Tim-Merlier-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Tim-Merlier-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Tim-Merlier.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Team Visma-Lease a Bike</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The elite men‚Äôs road race would also come down to a sprint finish after 222.8km of racing.
