Slimmer bezels, a slightly different arrangement of cameras on the back, a new processor, and so on. Now, a pair of new rumors gives us some possible insight into other changes from last year’s iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we have a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://weibo.com/6315816381/5018345584463802&amp;xcust=1-1-2300915-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">leaker from Chinese social media site Weibo</a> with an unproved track record who claims to have battery figures for this year’s iPhone 16 models (compared to the iPhone 15 lineup):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 16: 3561mAh  (+6%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 16 Plus: 4006mAh (-9%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 16 Pro: 3355mAh (+2.5%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 16 Pro Max: 4676mAh (+5%)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The capacities for all models are just slightly different than this year’s iPhone 15 lineup, with the biggest change being a nearly 10 percent drop in overall capacity for the iPhone 16 Plus. However, measuring battery capacity in milliamp-hours doesn’t always give a good picture of battery life, as it doesn’t take into account nominal voltage output. How long your iPhone lasts is a factor of much more than battery capacity: the power utilization of the processor, RAM, storage, wireless radios, display, and other sensors all play a huge part. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, it’s still too early to know if the iPhone 16 models will last longer than the iPhone 15 or not. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://weibo.com/5821279480/O94iNbyF1&amp;xcust=1-1-2300915-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Another Weibo leaker</a> claims to have the scoop on colors for the iPhone 16 Plus. We expect the regular iPhone 16 to carry the same colors, though the Pro models usually differ. According to this leaker, the colors for the iPhone 16 Plus will be white, black, blue, green, pink, purple, and yellow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the same colors as the current iPhone 15 models with the addition of white and purple. Of course, these simple adjectives don’t give us a feel for what they will really <em>look</em> like. Green can be a very pale pastel mint color green as it is on the iPhone 15 today, or a deep forest green, or anything in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more rumors and leaks about Apple’s 2024 iPhone lineup, check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16 guide</a>.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8ce16e10d752730443c076f026b937b47958975bd74efd8759a8bbd6522e2e29","category":"Apple"}
