With Windows App, users can connect to Azure Virtual Desktop, Windows 365, Microsoft Dev Box, Remote Desktop Services, and remote PCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft announced that Windows App is available in a special preview run that is available for iPhones, iPads, and Macs through Apple’s TestFlight program and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664&amp;xcust=1-1-2141759-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">app</a>, but TestFlight limits the number of users. The preview is open to anyone, but users will not be allowed to try it if the capacity limit has been met. Windows App can also be used through a browser or Windows PC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows App lets users access Windows across multiple different services and remote PCs. The customizable home screen allows users to pin favorites for quick and easy access. Multiple accounts are also supported, and Windows App has a feature that allows users to switch between them. According to the <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*l6kYCuH720&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=1-1-2141759-1-0-0&amp;murl=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-app/overview\">Microsoft Ignite website</a>, other features include multiple monitor support, custom display resolutions, dynamic display resolutions and scaling, device redirection for audio, printers, storage devices, and webcams; and Microsoft Teams optimizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The preview limits access to Microsoft business accounts, and the company has not commented on whether consumer access will be allowed in a future update. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23963568/microsoft-windows-app-ios-ipados-macos-web&amp;xcust=1-1-2141759-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">The Verge</a> notes that the sign-in prompt indicates that a personal account can be used but it doesn’t work. However, it’s an indication that Microsoft is looking to bring Windows to the cloud and make it easily accessible on your Apple device without running virtualization software.</p>\n\nWindows</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a14771b5d20c72f84d35f3d19326f9380b1908ff3699d2478cf185744b262d39","category":"Apple"}
