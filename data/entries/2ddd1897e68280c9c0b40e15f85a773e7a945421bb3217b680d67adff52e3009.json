By carefully monitoring characteristics such as power consumption, sound, electromagnetic emissions, or the amount of time it takes for an operation to occur, attackers can assemble enough information to recover secret keys that underpin the security and confidentiality of a cryptographic algorithm.</p>\n<h2>Side-channel exploitation made simple</h2>\n<p>As Wired <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2008/04/nsa-releases-se/\">reported in 2008</a>, one of the oldest known side channels was in a top-secret encrypted teletype terminal that the US Army and Navy used during World War II to transmit communications that couldnâ€™t be read by German and Japanese spies. To the surprise of the Bell Labs engineers who designed the terminal, it caused readings from a nearby oscilloscope each time an encrypted letter was entered. While the encryption algorithm in the device was sound, the electromagnetic emissions emanating from the device were enough to provide a side channel that leaked the secret key.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947319#p3\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947319&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2ddd1897e68280c9c0b40e15f85a773e7a945421bb3217b680d67adff52e3009","category":"Tech"}
