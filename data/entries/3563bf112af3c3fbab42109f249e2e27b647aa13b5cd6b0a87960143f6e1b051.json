The so-called iPhone 17 Air has a similar rear camera bump, but with only a single lens. Last, the regular iPhone 17 has the same design as the iPhone 16.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese designs are starting to look like the real deal, based on several <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/\">reports</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/iphone-17-pro-camera-design-leak/\">mockups</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/revealed-entire-iphone-17-lineups-camera-designs/\">leaked CADs</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/video-shows-iphone-17-mockups-internal-documents/\">dummy models</a> over the past few months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Here’s your first look at the iPhone 17 dummies, Thoughts? <a href=\"https://t.co/WnOjD71Iba\">pic.twitter.com/WnOjD71Iba</a></p>— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SonnyDickson/status/1901133468912038374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 16, 2025</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nNotably, these dummy models reveal a few potential features for the iPhone 17 Air that we had yet to hear about, including MagSafe and the Action button. There were some concerns that the iPhone 17 Air might lack MagSafe due to its ultra-thin design, but it appears the device will offer the feature after all, if these dummy models are accurate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe inclusion of an Action button instead of a Ring/Silent switch is not much of a surprise, but it is still good to see the first evidence of this change.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA report earlier today said the iPhone 17 Air will also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-battery-life-more/\">have a Camera Control button</a>, and the dummy model reflects that.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA side-by-side view of the dummy models reveals that the iPhone 17 Air will look noticeably thinner than the other three iPhone 17 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs usual, Apple should announce its new iPhone lineup in September.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-magsafe-action-button/\">'iPhone 17 Air' Dummy Model Features MagSafe and Action Button</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-dummy-model-features-magsafe-and-action-button.2453275/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3563bf112af3c3fbab42109f249e2e27b647aa13b5cd6b0a87960143f6e1b051","category":"Apple"}
