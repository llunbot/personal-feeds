Van der Poel did not make the start at the recent Benelux Tour, a race he won in 2020, but he did return to road racing – and winning – at the Antwerp Port Epic on September 12. He has since raced the Primus Classic and Gooikse Pijl.</p><p>The Dutch cycling federation had included Van der Poel in its provisional plans for men’s road race at Flanders Worlds, whose lumpy course suits the 26-year-old’s skillset, and now he is confirmed to be taking part.</p><p>“Mathieu has not had the ideal run-up to this World Championships, but he certainly gives an extra dimension to our road team, it increases our chances of success that he participates,” said national coach Koos Moerenhout.</p><p>“He may not be the clear favorite due to his physical issues leading up to this World Championships, but he will certainly be a rider to watch. I’m glad he’s getting started.”</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"e8da9c45daa8b0421326c029bfcd467158b2921971d0bdb99b56ffe20cfefea6","category":"Cycling"}
