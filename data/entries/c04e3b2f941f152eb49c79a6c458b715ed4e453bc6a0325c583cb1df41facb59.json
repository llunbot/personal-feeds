The tool will become available to all users of Google Photos starting May 15.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle Photos for iOS and Android will include 10 Magic Editor saves per month. To use more than that, users will need to buy a Premium Google One plan, which starts at 2TB of storage for $10 per month or $100 annually.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to Magic Editor, Google is bringing <a href=\"https://support.google.com/photos/thread/268658175/ai-editing-tools-are-coming-to-all-google-photos-users\">several more editing tools</a> to Google Photos, including Photo Unblur, Sky suggestions, Color pop, HDR effect for photos and videos, Portrait Blur, Portrait Light (plus its add light/balance light features), Cinematic Photos, Styles in the Collage Editor, and Video Effects.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo use the AI features, Apple devices must be running iOS 15 or later. Google Photos is a free download for iPhone and iPad <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/google-photos/id962194608\">available on the App Store</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-photos/\">Google Photos</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/google-pixel-magic-editor-coming-to-iphone/\">Google Pixel 8's Flagship AI Photo Editing Feature Coming to iPhones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-pixel-8s-flagship-ai-photo-editing-feature-coming-to-iphones.2423988/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c04e3b2f941f152eb49c79a6c458b715ed4e453bc6a0325c583cb1df41facb59","category":"Apple"}
