It plays a role in energy metabolism and assists with normal muscle function, and the need for magnesium has been shown to increase at higher levels of physical activity.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A study conducted during the 2019 Vuelta a España, for instance, found that riders taking a daily 400mg magnesium supplement benefitted from improved muscle recovery and a lower risk of muscle damage than those who were given a placebo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, few if any of us will be signing up for a three-week Grand Tour anytime soon, but magnesium’s advantages don’t end there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Improved muscle relaxation is another key benefit, while magnesium also supports nervous system health and wellbeing, heart and bone health, bone density, sugar and carbohydrate metabolism, protein synthesis… the list goes on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, magnesium is a multitasking mineral that contributes to far-reaching improvements to your overall health and wellbeing, regardless of your age or level of physical activity. And with the Advanced Magnesium+ Powder providing a hit of three of the most easily absorbed forms of magnesium in each serve, it’s tailor-made to fit in with your self-care protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The JSHealth Vitamins story</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"878\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-4-878x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-4-878x970.jpg 878w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-4-271x300.jpg 271w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-4-768x849.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-4-750x829.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-4-1140x1260.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://uk.jshealthvitamins.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JSHealth Vitamins</a> was founded by Jessica Sepel, a clinical nutritionist whose passion for wellness and healthy living saw her start a health blog in 2012 that quickly grew into a global wellness community drawn in by her commitment and ability to simplify the often-confusing world of vitamins and supplements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the way to becoming a three-time bestselling wellness author, Jessica decided to put her knowledge into practice with her own range of products, launching the <a href=\"https://uk.jshealthvitamins.com/products/jshealth-hair-vitamin-60-capsules\" target=\"_blank\">Hair + Energy ingestible haircare formula</a> that remains a bestseller to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days the JSHealth Vitamins website offers a huge array of wellness products, from skin and haircare supplements to protein powders and hormone replacements.

By introducing a powder supplement, however, those wellness benefits take on the added dimension of a deliciously refreshing Raspberry Lemonade flavour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We wanted to provide our customers a new way to experience our best-selling triple-form magnesium blend by offering a powder format that fits in with a wide range of different lifestyle routines,’ Jessica says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Magnesium is an important nutrient for daily wellness and this delicious powder is a wonderful way to make a mindful moment of getting your daily dose.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As already mentioned, the supplement includes three different forms of magnesium – magnesium glycinate, magnesium citrate and magnesium amino acid chelate – all of which have high absorption rates for increased effectiveness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoying the Advanced Magnesium+ Powder is simple. Mix one level scoop with water, stir well and consume immediately. Take twice daily for a total of 402mg of magnesium, with a 180g bottle providing a month’s supply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All ingredients are sourced with care, and the Advanced Magnesium+ Powder contains no animal products and so is vegan-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Discover the Advanced Magnesium+ Powder difference</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-5-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-5-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/jshealth-5.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There’s no questioning the difference a magnesium supplement can make to athletic performance and recovery, as well as overall health and wellbeing.
