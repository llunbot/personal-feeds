The setup would use one 12Ã—12-inch \"core\" monitor that has a cable to the connected system. The computer's operating system (OS) would be able to view the display setup as one, two, or multiple monitors, and physical switches would let users quickly disable displays.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7b.jpg\" /></div>\n          <p>\n            The illustration shows a monitor made of a core unit and two extension panels viewed as three monitors (left), two monitors (middle), and two monitors with different orientations (right).
