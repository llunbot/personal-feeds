It arrives just a few weeks before <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2558637/apple-releases-first-ios-18-3-beta.html\">iOS 18.3</a>, which began testing in December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s release notes are very brief, merely stating that the update “provides important bug fixes and is recommended for all users.” It’s not clear what the update specifically fixes as there are no known widespread bugs in iOS 18.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Apple’s security site, it says the update has no published CVE entries, which is unusual for point updates. Additionally, there is no corresponding update for macOS or iOS 17 devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple released <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2499054/ios-ipados-18-2-features-apple-intelligence-siri-genmoji-security-release.html\">iOS 18.2</a> in mid-December with several new Apple Intelligence features including <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2556848/how-to-apple-intelligence-siri-chatgpt-iphone.html\">ChatGPT integration</a>, several <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2524355/ios-18-2-features-camera-control-mail-volume-messages-sudoku-airtag.html\">quality-of-life improvements</a>, and numerous security updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To update your iPhone or iPad, head over to the Settings app, then <em>General</em> and <em>Software Update</em>. The 500MB update will take several minutes to install.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"92eef48a89fc4ad1a06cd17b4a0a6508ea948f39c5a8e0114eaf061db6e07696","category":"Apple"}
