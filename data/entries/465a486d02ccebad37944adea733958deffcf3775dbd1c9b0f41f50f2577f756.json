Having your bicycle disappear is a sure way to put a dampener on your week/month/year. Whether it goes missing from a garage, a dedicated parking stand or is cropped from a set of railings, the outcome is the same. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution is investing in a lock as tough as the mean streets through which you pedal. Yet with a huge degree of choice between various types, dimensions and security certifications, the range of bicycle locks available to discourage thieves is potentially baffling. Fortunately, we’re here to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The principal thing we’d recommend is that you allocate sufficient money to this new lock of yours. If your bike will be out of your sight and is worth stealing – and that category is broader than you might presume – you need at least a solid Sold Secure Bronze lock, and having a better lock will help when it comes to getting cheaper <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/bike-insurance\" target=\"_blank\">bike insurance</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the bike theft arms race, portable angle grinders are the pro thief’s current top weapon, and there’s a new class of angle grinder-resistant bike locks, which makers claim to be impervious – or at least near-impervious – to attack. We’ve highlighted some of those, as well as more affordable but still well regarded bike locks below.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>The best Sold Secure Diamond and Gold bike locks </h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Angle grinder resistant bike locks</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Abus Granit Super Extreme 2500</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hiplok D1000</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Litelok X</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>OnGuard RockSolid</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>SkunkLock Chemical</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Full-size D locks</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Litelok X1</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Abus Granit X-Plus 540</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Kryptonite Evolution</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Oxford Shackle 14 Duo</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Onguard Pitbull</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Halfords Advanced 23cm D Lock</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Squire Stronghold D16/230</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Flexible and chain locks</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kryptonite Evolution Integrated Chain Lock</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Litelok Core Flex</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hiplok Gold</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Abus Bordo Granit X-Plus 6500</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Oxford Linklock GL</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mini D-locks</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hiplok DX</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Kryptonite Fahgettaboudit Mini</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Abus Ultimate 420 (inc. cable)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Master Lock U-Lock</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/safest-bike-helmet\">Bike helmet safety: Standards, testing and tech, plus Virginia Tech’s top-rated helmets</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/bike-insurance\">Bike insurance: All you need to know and compare quotes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-storage-ideas\">Best bike storage ideas: Smart ways to store and display your bicycle</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes of 2024 reviewed by Cyclist’s experts</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is ‘Sold Secure’?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sold Secure is a rating bestowed on locks independently tested by the Master Locksmiths Association. Being non-partisan, we’d always rely on its evaluation as a guide instead of any manufacturer’s claims. In our experience, anything below Bronze level will be susceptible to prying, hammer strike, hacksaw and bolt-cutter type attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while various styles of lock manage to score a Bronze rating, we’d steer clear of any kind of flexible cable design regardless of its certification. This is because although they might stall an opportunist thief, we’ve not yet found one that couldn’t be defeated with a set of quality bolt croppers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, stick to a solid chain or D-lock that’s Bronze-rated or above, and any thief will at least need to be in possession of an angle grinder to be in with a chance of nicking your bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hard like a diamond</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, if you live in a high-crime area, we suggest you invest in a Sold Secure Gold or Diamond certified lock if you can afford one. Formerly the highest certification you could find, Gold locks tend to start from around £40, and many insurers now demand this rating if you want to cover yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more recently introduced Diamond standard is intended to distinguish between locks at the top of the market. As locks have improved, the previous rating system provided little to differentiate the better ones. The Diamond class is reserved for the best of the best. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that this isn’t a market where product novelty is rewarded by anything other than a missing bike, expect to see the same names appear in our list multiple times. Want a lighter lock? The best you’re going to get is one that’s smaller, which might work if you’ve got a skinny-tubed bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost all locks are based around a tempered steel construction, and weight is usually directly correlated to strength. So while a lock might seem weighty, it’ll be less heavy than your heart should you return to find your bike isn’t where you left it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, you should aim to spend 10% of the cost of your bike on its lock – if you can’t find a lock that matches the price of your bike, it means it’s probably too expensive to leave unattended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just a question of having a great lock though – you need to know how to use it correctly, so read our post on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/lock-it-or-lose-it-reformed-bike-thiefs-advice-could-stop-your-bike-being-stolen\" target=\"_blank\">how to lock a bike</a>, with tips from a reformed bike thief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many bikes are stolen by opportunist thieves, when their owners just leave them for a minute or two. A <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-small-and-lightweight-bike-locks-compact-and-transportable-locks\" target=\"_blank\">lightweight cafe lock</a> won’t stop a determined bike thief, but you’re more likely to carry and use it if you’re running an errand or stopping mid-ride. A bike alarm, such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/alterlock-review\" target=\"_blank\">AlterLock</a>, or an alarmed lock can also help deter theft or tampering.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The best angle grinder-resistant bike locks</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Abus Granit Super Extreme 2500</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"960\" height=\"717\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/96050_Granit_Super_Extreme_2500_USH2500_Lifestyle_5844_abus_960.jpg\" alt=\"Abus Granit Super Extreme 2500 lock\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/96050_Granit_Super_Extreme_2500_USH2500_Lifestyle_5844_abus_960.jpg 960w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/96050_Granit_Super_Extreme_2500_USH2500_Lifestyle_5844_abus_960-300x224.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/96050_Granit_Super_Extreme_2500_USH2500_Lifestyle_5844_abus_960-768x574.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/96050_Granit_Super_Extreme_2500_USH2500_Lifestyle_5844_abus_960-750x560.jpg 750w\" /><figcaption>Abus</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Type:</strong> D-lock</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sold Secure rating:</strong> Diamond</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 23cm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 2.5kg</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Extras:</strong> Bike mount</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Abus houses the hardened 27mm thick steel shackle and body of the Granit Super Extreme 2500 in an ultra-tough tungsten carbide shell to deflect angle grinders.

Rubber coating protects your frame too.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>SkunkLock Chemical</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"779\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SkunkLock-Chemical-970x779.jpg\" alt=\"SkunkLock Chemical lock\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SkunkLock-Chemical-970x779.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SkunkLock-Chemical-300x241.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SkunkLock-Chemical-768x616.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SkunkLock-Chemical-750x602.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/SkunkLock-Chemical.jpg 1125w\" /><figcaption>SkunkLock</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Type:</strong> D-lock</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sold Secure rating:</strong> Not tested</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 23cm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 2.0kg</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Extras:</strong>  None</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It hasn’t been Sold Secure tested, but the SkunkLock Chemical has a trick up its sleeve to deter thieves – cut into it and they’ll spray themselves with an aerosol of its contents of foul-smelling, vomit-inducing chemicals, which soaks into clothing and will coat the tools used.

It scores the maximum 10/10 on Kryptonite’s security scale. Your bike will be safe and sound in the highest-risk urbanised areas, Kryptonite even offers a scheme where it will pay up to £2,500 toward a replacement bike if a thief defeats the lock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been lucky enough to have a test sample of the Fahgettaboudit for a few months. From that, we’d say, with the twang of Donnie Brasco’s New York accent ringing in our ears, this lock from Kryptonite is as tough as an American-Italian nonna talking about her cannolis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smaller than average, the Fahgettaboudit’s narrow width makes it even tougher. However, it’s worth noting that it’s no lightweight. It’s actually one of the heaviest on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its 18mm steel-hardened U-lock specs and Gold standard are reassuring, but the U-bar is small so can be tough to fit around bike stands. You need a narrow frame tube and a slender anchor point to really make the most of this lock. On the plus side, it’s easily fitted into a backpack to transport. A great choice if you’re happy to spend time picking your spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/45m5onA\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclestore £119.99</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Abus Ultimate 420/140</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Abus-Granit-lock-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Abus-Granit-lock-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Abus-Granit-lock-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Abus-Granit-lock-768x510.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Abus-Granit-lock-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Abus-Granit-lock-750x498.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Abus-Granit-lock-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Abus-Granit-lock-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Abus-Granit-lock-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Abus-Granit-lock-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Abus-Granit-lock.jpg 1562w\" /><figcaption>Abus</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Type:</strong> Mini D-lock</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sold Secure rating:</strong> Gold</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 15cm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 1.25kg</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Extras:</strong> Replaceable coded keys</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Abus Ultimate uses a double-locking mechanism and a 13mm shackle that extends through the lock body to better protect against torsion/twisting attacks.
