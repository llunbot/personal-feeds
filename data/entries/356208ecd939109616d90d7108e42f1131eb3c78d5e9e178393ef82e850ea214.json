Ewan, who <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/caleb-ewan-ineos-grenadiers\">signed a one-year deal</a> with Ineos Grenadiers for 2025, impressed on his first race, winning the opening stage of the Coppi e Bartali, but has called it quits just a few months into the season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ewan said, ‘The last few years haven’t been easy but in 2025 I found something again – not just legs, but belief – thanks to Ineos Grenadiers. They gave me space, trust and the environment to rediscover what I am capable of. I won again. I felt like myself again and I felt respected again. For that, I can’t thank them enough.<br /><br />‘But the truth is that even when I crossed the line first, that feeling – the one you chase for years – faded quicker than it used to. My experiences of the past two seasons, in particular the second half of 2024, has taken a significant toll on my relationship with the sport. I’m happy I didn’t let that period define the end of my career and I am proud of what I achieved in a short but successful time with Ineos Grenadiers.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His last victory came at Stage 2 of the Itzulia Basque Country in April. Throughout his 11-year career, the Australian was a prolific sprinter known for his ability to contort himself into an extremely low, aero position on the bike. He has achieved the prestigious Grand Tour hat-trick, winning five stages each at the Giro d’Italia and the Tour de France plus one at the Vuelta a España.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+2\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'get the magazine for people who love cycling, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>More TTT madness at the Vuelta</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1790\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2213336212-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2213336212-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2213336212-300x210.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2213336212-970x678.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2213336212-768x537.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2213336212-1536x1074.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2213336212-2048x1432.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2213336212-750x524.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2213336212-1140x797.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Szymon Gruchalski/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a chaotic start to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-vuelta-femenina-preview\">La Vuelta Femenina</a> on Sunday. Several teams were late to the start of the team time-trial after delays having their bikes inspected. Uno X’s Katrine Aalerud was delayed getting to the start, as were two Visma-Lease a Bike riders, including Imogen Wolff, who ended up losing 1min 16sec. All Movistar riders were fined 200 CHF for being late to their bike checks. The day was won by Lidl-Trek, with Ellen van Dijk crossing the line for the first leader’s red jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike filed an official complaint with the UCI jury, saying, ‘Although the riders arrived well in time for the mandatory bike check prior to the team time-trial, delays occurred due to another team arriving late. In addition, the check was initially carried out by only one official, further extending the wait time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘A second inspector was deployed later, but by then, Team Visma-Lease a Bike Women was no longer able to benefit from the extra capacity. As a result, some riders received their bikes back so late that they could not reach the start on time.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an Instagram post that was later deleted, Visma rider Pauline Ferrand-Prévot said: ‘WTF!! Can’t believe what happened this afternoon, in one of the biggest races of the season. This is SO amateur. The entire team have been preparing hard for this event, and we were all on time for the bike check (20min before). Seems like the jury didn’t take us seriously when we said to them that we will be late for our start if they don’t hurry up a bit. [UCI] we prone for a fair sport, but this is nothing to do with our values.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully Marianne Vos turned things around for the team by winning Stage 2, but wasn’t within reach of the overall lead due to those Stage 1 losses.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-winners-losers-april-2025\">Pro cycling winners and losers in April</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-women-preview\">Tour of Britain Women 2025: Route, how to watch and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-watch-la-vuelta-femenina-2025\">How to watch La Vuelta Femenina 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/la-vuelta-femenina-preview\">La Vuelta Femenina 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch, and start list</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Giro d’Italia 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch and start list</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Red Bull KM is the Giro’s newest addition</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1120\" height=\"615\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-06-122233.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-06-122233.webp 1120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-06-122233-300x165.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-06-122233-970x533.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-06-122233-768x422.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-06-122233-750x412.webp 750w\" /><figcaption>Red Bull</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A new feature for the 2025 Giro d’Italia will be the Red Bull KM, a twist on the usual intermediate sprints with a focus on the general classification. Taking place on all but the two time-trial stages, the kilometre leading up to the line works as a ‘gateway’ to an intermediate sprint for bonus seconds. The winner of the Red Bull KM will receive a time bonus of six seconds, with second place receiving four and third place getting two seconds.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be held at varying points in each stage, for example 48km from the finish on Stage 1 and on top of a climb on Stage 9, 14km from the finish. On the penultimate stage, the Red Bull KM will be positioned on the dirt track just 4.3km from the Colle delle Finestre. Only time will tell if it adds some spice to the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Women’s Tour of Britain route released</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2156499083-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2156499083-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2156499083-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2156499083-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2156499083-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2156499083-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2156499083-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2156499083-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2156499083-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2156499083-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/GettyImages-2156499083-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Matt McNulty/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage routes have been released for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-women-preview\">Tour of Britain Women</a>, which will take place from Thursday 5th June to Sunday 8th June in England and Scotland.
