This is a top-tier flagship that <em>of course</em> is not coming to the US but is available in Europe for a whopping 1,499 euros ($1,624).</p>\n<p>Let's get the specs out of the way: This has a 120 Hz, 3200×1440 OLED, a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and a 5000 mAh battery. A proprietary 90 W wired \"HyperCharge\" will get the phone from 0–100 percent battery in 33 minutes, while a wireless 80 W version will charge the phone in 46 minutes.</p>\n<p>Xiaomi is very proud that all four sides of the screen are curved. The whole screen kind of rises up and bubbles out from the aluminum body. Xiaomi says the glass has \"<span>deep bending around all four sides and corners, creating a seamlessly elegant curved form.</span>\" All images, videos, websites, and apps expect to display on a flat surface, so curved displays serve to distort the picture you're looking at, and thankfully some manufacturers have started <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/the-pixel-8-pro-heralds-the-death-of-curved-screen-smartphones/\">to drop</a> the idea. Having the display be a big glass bubble also means you now have four glass corners on the front of the phone, so uh, don't drop it!</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006628#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006628&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9d0ead97a98ea03b06f34995fedfbfa772c5af525e3e81d0e413fae3e5e1663e","category":"Tech"}
