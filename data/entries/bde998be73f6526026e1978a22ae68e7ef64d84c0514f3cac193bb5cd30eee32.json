Often the scene of GC moves and heroic efforts, the mountains are where the Italian Grand Tour will be won and lost once more in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s Giro will take the riders through the Alps and the Apennines during <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">the three-week expedition around Italy</a> (and Albania). Starting across the Adriatic, the race will get stuck into the mountains as early as week one, with the first summit finish scheduled for Stage 7. After that, the race will move northeastwards, eventually crossing the Alps to the French border in the final week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both familiar names and fresh faces will make an appearance in this year’s Corsa Rosa. The race racks up a total elevation gain of 52,000m over the 21 stages – almost 10,000 more than last year’s race. In preparation for the 2025 edition, we’ve broken down a handful of the most notable and iconic climbs to feature in this year’s Giro d’Italia route.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Stage 7: Tagliacozzo</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"639\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/CxO22b85FhCtQaKEpKvx_280425-015241.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/CxO22b85FhCtQaKEpKvx_280425-015241.webp 639w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/CxO22b85FhCtQaKEpKvx_280425-015241-225x300.webp 225w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The first summit finish of the Giro comes on Stage 7 between the football historian’s favourite Castel di Sangro and, the climb in question, Tagliacozzo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Serving as the first proper mountain test of the 2025 race, its importance is obvious. After the opening nine or so kilometres at a 4.6% average gradient, the brutal final 3km kicks up to a 10% average, with the steepest ramps tipping up to 13% around a series of hairpins. Luckily for the peloton, the final 300m or so are on a gentle 3%, but after such a test before, the final is likely to be contested by a reduced group of early GC favourites. Primož Roglič, this looks perfect for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be Tagliacozzo’s Giro debut. In fact, it’s only hosted one bike race of any kind before, the 1935 Giro del Lazio. It’s fair to say the sport has changed since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+5\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the finest writing and photography delivered every month, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-5-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stage 9: Colle Pinzuto and the Via Santa Caterina</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-1305658972-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-1305658972-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-1305658972-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-1305658972-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-1305658972-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-1305658972-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-1305658972-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-1305658972-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-1305658972-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-1305658972-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-1305658972-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Luc Claessen/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been greedy with this choice by throwing two climbs into one: the Colle Pinzuto and the Via Santa Caterina. If the names seem familiar, it’s because they’re mainstays in the iconic Classic Strade Bianche.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, the gravel roads will be making a welcome return to the Giro in 2025 on Stage 9, which is effectively a fully fledged homage to Strade Bianche. In following the Classic’s <em>parcours</em>, the final two obstacles of the day will be familiar to Strade Bianche specialists, starting with the gravel climb of the Colle Pinzuto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually the penultimate sector in Strade Bianche, the main part of the Pinzuto climb is a 500m-long ramp at an average of 11%. Given that it’s the last gravel sector on offer, it’ll be the perfect springboard for some gutsy riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"956\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/santa-caterina-climb.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/santa-caterina-climb.webp 956w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/santa-caterina-climb-300x267.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/santa-caterina-climb-768x684.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/santa-caterina-climb-750x668.webp 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although not on gravel, the Via Santa Caterina is the most iconic climb in Strade Bianche. It usually concludes the race as the frontrunners duke it out on the incredibly narrow and very steep ramp into Siena. Luckily, that well-trodden finale will be mirrored on Stage 9 of this year’s Giro. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 500m in length, the incline hits 16% at its toughest. There’s not much room to overtake either, so the riders will be swinging across the road like bumper cars before turning right at the crest. It’ll be a real spectacle seeing how the riders fare and whether there’s any GC action.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

on Stage 20. This year, it’s back again, this time earlier on in the race on Stage 16. There’s some difference this time around too, as the riders will be approaching the climb from Romano d’Ezzelino. It’s slightly easier than last year’s ascent at a 5.7% average gradient but a little longer at 25km, however 2024 featured a double ascent where this time around there’s only one and it falls in the middle of the stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mountain’s history goes far beyond the Giro d’Italia. The Battles of Monte Grappa marked an important turning point on Italy’s northern front against Austro-Hungarian advancements in World War I. In memory of the fallen, an ossuary and memorial can be found at the summit of the climb. In World War II, Monte Grappa played a different role as a hiding spot for Italian Partisans seeking refuge from Nazi occupation. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"639\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-2025.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-2025.webp 639w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-2025-225x300.webp 225w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/monte-grappa-italy-cycling\">Monte Grappa Big Ride</a> </strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stage 16: San Valentino</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-1483283120-min-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-1483283120-min-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-1483283120-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-1483283120-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-1483283120-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-1483283120-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-1483283120-min-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-1483283120-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-1483283120-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-1483283120-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-1483283120-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/GettyImages-1483283120-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim Dde Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One for the romantics, the San Valentino climb will be a brutal finale to Stage 16’s testing day. This will be the climb’s first appearance on the Giro, so it might come as a surprise to the contenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>San Valentino is one of these staircase climbs. It’s split into three neat sections, all followed by around 1km of descent to allow the riders to catch their breath – except for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-news-2025-caleb-ewan\">Red Bull bonus </a>after 8km in Brentonico – a new feature for this year’s Giro where bonus seconds are on offer. The first of these steps comes in the first 7km, averaging out at a 6.7% gradient. The middle section of the climb is the toughest by far, with a 4km stretch at over 9%.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"639\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/san-valentino-climb-2025.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/san-valentino-climb-2025.webp 639w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/san-valentino-climb-2025-225x300.webp 225w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Although it hasn’t featured on the Giro route, it has been used at the Tour of the Alps.

In an interview with <em>Gazzetta dello Sport </em>in the early 2000s, L*nce *rmstrong described it as the ‘hardest climb he had ever ridden’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Monno, the average gradient is deceiving at only 7.6%, but the climb ramps up to a maximum of 16% in its final phase. Once the race hits these slopes, the gradient stays in double digits until they crest the summit.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"639\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/mortirolo-2025.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/mortirolo-2025.webp 639w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/mortirolo-2025-225x300.webp 225w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Mortirolo was first included on the Giro route in 1990, when it was raced in the opposite direction. But after a brutally steep descent on a chaotic stage to Aprica, it was decided to swap things around and since then the climb has featured on the Giro <em>percorso </em>on 15 occasions, most recently in 2024 on the stage to Livigno, when Tadej Pogačar attacked away from the peloton, gained three minutes and hoovered up the breakaway one by one – business as usual then.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read</strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/big-ride-good-cop-bad-cop-on-the-mortirolo-and-gavia\"><strong> </strong></a><strong>our</strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/big-ride-good-cop-bad-cop-on-the-mortirolo-and-gavia\"><strong> Mortirolo Big Ride</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stage 19: Col de Joux</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-12.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-12.webp 1200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-12-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-12-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-12-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-12-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-12-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-12-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-12-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Adobe-Express-file-12-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Giro Ciclistico della Valle d'Aosta - Mont Blanc</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 19 will be one of the most gruelling at this year’s Giro, with 4,900m of elevation gain through the Valle d’Aosta region. There’s a total of five categorised climbs on the day, the most crucial being the French-named Col de Joux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to be confused with the similarly-titled Col de Joux Plane towards Morzine, the Col de Joux is the penultimate test on this 166km-long stage. At 15km in length and a 7% average, it’s a slog. To make matters harder, a bonus second sprint will come at the base of the climb in Saint-Vincent.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"639\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/col-de-joux-giro.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/col-de-joux-giro.webp 639w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/col-de-joux-giro-225x300.webp 225w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The gradient is steady throughout, with some pinch points at 8% in the opening and closing kilometres of the climb. The crest comes at 20km to go, so some key moves could be made on the climb. Alternatively, a pivotal filtration of the group could be churned out by the likes of UAE Team Emirates or Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe setting a relentless pace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been over ten years since the Giro last visited the Col de Joux. In fact, it was in 2012 when it last made a cameo, back on a stage won by Movistar and Ineos alumni Andrey Amador. On that day, it also played a role as the penultimate climb of the day. This time, it comes closer to the finish line, and is the final climb before the finish down the road in Champoluc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stage 20: Colle delle Finestre</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/02194953/classic_climb_finestre_13-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"classic_climb_finestre_13\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/02194953/classic_climb_finestre_13-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/02194953/classic_climb_finestre_13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/02194953/classic_climb_finestre_13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/02194953/classic_climb_finestre_13-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/02194953/classic_climb_finestre_13-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/02194953/classic_climb_finestre_13-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/02194953/classic_climb_finestre_13-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/02194953/classic_climb_finestre_13-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/02194953/classic_climb_finestre_13.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve waited seven years for the gravelled slopes of the Colle delle Finestre to make their return to the Giro d’Italia. This year, it will come on Stage 20, the final day in the mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The opening 14km of the Finestre are tarmacked at an average gradient of 9%. The remaining 40% of the climb is on gravel, with the gradient sticking just above the 9% marker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 4km remaining on the climb, the riders will be given the added challenge of fighting for six, four and two bonus seconds through the Red Bull KM. Riders will have to measure their efforts going for that if they want to remain in the fight at the top though.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"639\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/colle-delle-finestre.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/colle-delle-finestre.webp 639w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/colle-delle-finestre-225x300.webp 225w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The climb has been given Cima Coppi status this year, so a special prize will be handed out to the first rider over the top as well as a huge 50-point mountains package for the leader on the road. The Finestre has been the Cima Coppi on its two most recent occasions, and interestingly the pink jersey at the time was dropped by the leader over the top of the climb on both times of asking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last time the Corsa Rosa tackled this test, Chris Froome turned the 2018 Giro d’Italia on its head with a mighty attack on the climb, distancing race leader Simon Yates en route to taking the <em>maglia rosa</em> with one day of racing left between himself and the finale in Rome. It’ll be a hard act to follow, but if the GC is on a knife-edge, the Finestre could provide another race for the history books in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is if they reach the climb at all. Reporters on the ground have shared photos of the summit caked in knee-deep snow. Let’s hope that all clears away by the time the Giro arrives there later this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/colle-delle-finestre-cycling\" target=\"_blank\"> </a>our<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/colle-delle-finestre-cycling\"> Colle delle Finestre Classic Climb</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'tasty morsels sent straight to your inbox, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-climbs-2025\">The key climbs of the Giro d’Italia 2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"bde998be73f6526026e1978a22ae68e7ef64d84c0514f3cac193bb5cd30eee32","category":"Cycling"}
