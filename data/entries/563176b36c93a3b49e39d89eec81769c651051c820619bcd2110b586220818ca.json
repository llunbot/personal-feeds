It has been issued because “certain batches [of the stem] can develop cracks in particular conditions”, according to Shimano (Pro’s parent company).</p>\n<p>The defect is caused by corrosion, which can lead to cracks forming in the clamping area of the fork steerer tube, says Shimano.</p>\n<p>Affected riders should stop using the stem immediately and contact the dealer they purchased the stem from.</p>\n<p>Shimano says any questions should be sent to <a href=\"mailto:provibe_recall@shimano-eu.com\" target=\"_blank\">provibe_recall@shimano-eu.com</a>. Riders in Australia should contact <a href=\"mailto:pro_recall@shimano.com.au\">pro_recall@shimano.com.au</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.pro-bikegear.com/uk/news/recall-notice-vibe-stem\" target=\"_blank\">full recall notice is available on the Pro website</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"563176b36c93a3b49e39d89eec81769c651051c820619bcd2110b586220818ca","category":"Cycling"}
