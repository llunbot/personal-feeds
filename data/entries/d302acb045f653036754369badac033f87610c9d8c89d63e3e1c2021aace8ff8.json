You can now even buy a custom 3D printed saddle, where it’s designed to precisely match how you sit on your saddle and your ride style, alleviate saddle pressure problems and give you a five star ride experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll still pay a premium price for a 3D printed saddle, due to the time and expense of 3D printing. Thus saddle makers tend to use their premium carbon bases and rails for their 3D printed saddles, although that’s changing and the same saddle with lower priced metal rails is often a slightly cheaper option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below, you’ll find our pick of the best 3D printed road and gravel cycling saddles, while further down you can read our guide to how to choose the best 3D printed saddle to help improve your ride comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best 3D printed saddles and reviews</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Specialized S-Works Romin Evo with Mirror: RRP £350</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fizik Tempo Aliante R1 Adaptive One-to-One: RRP £499 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-review\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Posedla Joyseat: RRP £390 – read our full review – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/posedla-joyseat-3d-printed-custom-saddle-review\">read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Selle Italia Novus Boost Evo: RRP £399.99</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Prologo Nago R4 PAS 3DMSS: RRP £349</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Selle San Marco Shortfit 2.0 3D Carbon FX: RRP £359.99</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Elves Magic Osse Pro: RRP £158</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Why trust <em>Cyclist</em>‘s advice?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Man riding bike on indoor rollers\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-4.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve ridden many of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\">best road bikes</a> here at <em>Cyclist</em>, as well as reviewing many premium saddles.

The Romin Evo comes in either 143mm or 155mm width and according to Specialized each has 22,200 struts and 10,700 nodes to support you and distribute weight, supported on a carbon saddle shell and carbon rails. There’s a central cut-out and Specialized says that the Romin Evo has the thickest 3D printed pad in its range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top spec S-Works models are pricy, but you can save a little cash with the Pro models, which swap carbon rails for titanium. The Pro saddles still aren’t cheap and add around 50g to the saddle weight, but they do open up 3D printed saddle tech to a wider consumer base and are competitive with high-end conventional saddles.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a

with Specialized, Fizik offers a range of different saddle models and spec levels with its Adaptive 3D printed upper. Standard Fizik Adaptive saddles are available at 00, R1 and R3 spec levels, with a corresponding range of prices. Most saddles are sold in multiple widths too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fizik has gone better though with its One-to-One custom saddle printing, which will 3D print a saddle specific to your needs, based on pressure mapping of how you sit on the saddle. This is used to determine what Fizik believes is the best saddle shape for you from its available Adaptive range and to custom design the 3D printed padding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a small number of One-to-One dealers, with the saddle taking around two weeks to produce after the pressure mapping session. It can be shipped either direct to you or to the dealer, for a second pressure mapping session to confirm the change in saddle pressure distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-review\">Fizik One-to-One custom saddle review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3462&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.condorcycles.com%2Fpages%2Ffizik-one-to-one\" target=\"_blank\">Condor Cycles (from £459)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Posedla Joyseat 3D printed custom saddle</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/posedla-joyseat-saddle-review-4-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Posedla Joyseat saddle\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/posedla-joyseat-saddle-review-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/posedla-joyseat-saddle-review-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/posedla-joyseat-saddle-review-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/posedla-joyseat-saddle-review-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/posedla-joyseat-saddle-review-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/posedla-joyseat-saddle-review-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/posedla-joyseat-saddle-review-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/posedla-joyseat-saddle-review-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/posedla-joyseat-saddle-review-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/posedla-joyseat-saddle-review-4.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£390 | <a href=\"https://posedla.co.uk/products/joyseat?variant=49839199748426\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another bespoke 3D printed saddle option, the Posedla Joyseat comes from a Czech company and is available for road, gravel or MTB use.

We loved the comfort of the 3D printed padding and the weight is competitive, although our reviewer reckoned that she’d have been better suited to a slightly narrower shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/posedla-joyseat-3d-printed-custom-saddle-review\">Posedla Joyseat 3D printed saddle review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://posedla.co.uk/products/joyseat?variant=49839199748426\" target=\"_blank\">Posedla (£390)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Selle Italia SLR Boost 3D Kit Carbonio Superflow</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1743\" height=\"1163\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/selle-italia-3d-saddle-1-e1743599490305.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/selle-italia-3d-saddle-1-e1743599490305.jpg 1743w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/selle-italia-3d-saddle-1-e1743599490305-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/selle-italia-3d-saddle-1-e1743599490305-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/selle-italia-3d-saddle-1-e1743599490305-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/selle-italia-3d-saddle-1-e1743599490305-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/selle-italia-3d-saddle-1-e1743599490305-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/selle-italia-3d-saddle-1-e1743599490305-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/selle-italia-3d-saddle-1-e1743599490305-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/selle-italia-3d-saddle-1-e1743599490305-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/selle-italia-3d-saddle-1-e1743599490305-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£399.99 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3462&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.Selle-Italia-SLR-Boost-3D-Kit-Carbonio-Superflow-Saddle_259209.htm\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All the main saddle brands now offer 3D printed saddles and Selle Italia is no exception, with three of its saddles available with 3D printed padding: the Novus Boost Evo, SLR Boost and Watt.

You probably know which saddles suit you, but if not it’s worth seeing which saddles might work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most saddle brands have a saddle selection tool online or that one of the brand’s dealers can use to suggest a saddle for you. The flashiest systems use a pressure mapping pad to see where your weight is concentrated and identify any asymmetries, while online tools typically use a small range of factors such as width of sitbones, how flexible you are and the type of riding you do. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Next try out a saddle</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most saddle brands have a try-before-you-buy or money-back scheme to help you to choose a saddle, which may include a saddle library from which you can loan a saddle to try. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many saddles are available at different spec levels, so if you’re thinking of spending money on an expensive 3D printed saddle, it may be worth the outlay to buy a cheap version to make sure that you like the shape first. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do you want to go custom?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>3D printing should give you the acme of saddle comfort, but if you want to go further, a custom saddle might help address asymmetries or other persistent saddle problems. Once you’ve opted for a 3D printed saddle, the incremental cost of a custom saddle isn’t huge, so this might be an extra step worth taking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting, however, that we didn’t feel that our custom saddle fits for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-review\">Fizik </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/posedla-joyseat-3d-printed-custom-saddle-review\">Posedla </a>saddles produced a saddle that was quite right for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Choose your base and rails – and how much you want to pay</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the saddles above are available at multiple spec levels and price points, characterised by different rail materials. Carbon rails are the lightest, but a metal railed saddle could prove to be more durable and will save a little cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-3d-printed-saddles-2025-and-custom-bike-saddles-reviewed\">Best 3D printed saddles 2025 and custom bike saddles reviewed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d302acb045f653036754369badac033f87610c9d8c89d63e3e1c2021aace8ff8","category":"Cycling"}
