They're available now in the U.S., Canada, and China, with launches in other countries to follow in the coming months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus Rumored to Feature 48-Megapixel Camera Like Pro Models</h2>\r<br />\nWhile the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max received an upgraded 48-megapixel Main camera last year, the lower-cost iPhone 14 and 14 Plus did not get the same upgrade. It looks like those cheaper options may catch up this year, however, as a new report claims the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/14/iphone-15-and-15-plus-48mp-camera/\">iPhone 15 and 15 Plus will get that 48-megapixel camera</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/iPhone-15-Cyan-and-Magenta-Frosted-Back-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAs for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, those devices <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/17/iphone-15-pro-max-camera-redesign-periscope/\">may be seeing a rearranged rear camera layout</a> to accommodate the higher-zoom periscope camera that will be exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Testing 'M3 Pro' Chip for MacBook Pro With 12-Core CPU and 18-Core GPU</h2>\r<br />\nApple's next-generation M3 chips for the Mac and iPad aren't coming until later this year, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has shared some details on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/14/m3-pro-chip-potential-specs/\">what to expect for the \"M3 Pro\" chip</a> that will likely make its way into the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro and other devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/m3-feature-black.jpg\" alt width=\"1810\" height=\"1018\" />\r<br />\nAccording to Gurman, the M3 Pro will feature a 12-core CPU, an 18-core GPU, and up to 36 GB of memory. That's up from a 10-core CPU, 16-core CPU, and up to 32 GB of memory on the current M2 Pro chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Previews iOS 17 Accessibility Features Ahead of WWDC</h2>\r<br />\nApple this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/apple-previews-ios-17-accessibility-features/\">previewed a wide range of new accessibility features</a> for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac that are set to arrive later this year, presumably as part of iOS 17 and macOS 14.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Apple-accessibility-iPad-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Home-Screen-Feature-1.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nNew features include Assistive Access to distill iPhone and iPad apps to their core features for the ultimate in interface simplicity, Point and Speak in the Magnifier app to automatically read text labels from the real-world aloud as the user points to them, Personal Voice to allow those at risk of losing their ability to speak to create a digital voice that sounds like them, and much more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/may-18-2023\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/20/top-stories-ios-16-5-release-headset-rumors/\">Top Stories: iOS 16.5 Released, Apple Headset Rumors, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-ios-16-5-released-apple-headset-rumors-and-more.2390060/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ba84da0afc80bca7773f0a6f1a316fd431011aebd49dd7de606a9e048bc3f6cb","category":"Apple"}
