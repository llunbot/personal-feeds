Last week, the company <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/7-million-pounds-of-meat-recalled-amid-deadly-outbreak/\">recalled more than 7 million pounds of its meats</a>, which was in addition to a recall of over 200,000 pounds of meat from July 26. In all, 71 types of products made between May 10, 2024, and July 29, 2024, and sold nationwide have been recalled.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/delimeats-7-24/index.html\">an update Thursday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, the outbreak has now sickened a total of 43 people, an increase from 34 last week. There have been 43 hospitalizations, up from 33 last week. The illnesses are reported from 13 states. The three deaths in the outbreak include one from Illinois and one from New Jersey, and the newly reported death is from Virginia. The CDC expects the tally of illnesses so far to be a significant undercount of actual cases, and additional states may be affected.</p>\n<p>The illnesses in the outbreak are caused by <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>, a foodborne bacterium that is particularly dangerous to people who are pregnant, people aged 65 years or older, and people who have weakened immune systems. In these high-risk groups, the bacteria are more likely to move beyond the gastrointestinal system to cause an invasive infection called listeriosis. During pregnancy, listeriosis can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or a life-threatening infection in newborns. For non-pregnant people who develop listeriosis, nearly 90 percent require hospitalization, and one in six die.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042033#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042033&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cd7ca6650d68cd1fa5843b9f77c00e277a5a3a780a9a75d4f3675df36c987306","category":"Tech"}
