The project seeks to match Deep Research's performance while making the technology freely available to developers.</p>\n<p>\"While powerful LLMs are now freely available in open-source, OpenAI didn’t disclose much about the agentic framework underlying Deep Research,\" writes Hugging Face on its announcement page. \"So we decided to embark on a 24-hour mission to reproduce their results and open-source the needed framework along the way!\"</p>\n<p>Similar to both OpenAI's Deep Research and Google's implementation of its own \"Deep Research\" using Gemini (first <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/\">introduced in December</a>—before OpenAI), Hugging Face's solution adds an \"agent\" framework to an existing AI model to allow it to perform multi-step tasks, such as collecting information and building the report as it goes along that it presents to the user at the end.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/after-24-hour-hackathon-hugging-faces-ai-research-agent-nearly-matches-openais-solution/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/after-24-hour-hackathon-hugging-faces-ai-research-agent-nearly-matches-openais-solution/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a7d96ef7a8af836b1cc55082c234fa6f3c8b1dd2b8d235426e5d7108b9273a65","category":"Tech"}
