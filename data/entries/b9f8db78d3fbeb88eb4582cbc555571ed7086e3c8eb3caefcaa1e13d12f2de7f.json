You’ll have to stick the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/criterium-du-dauphine-preview\" target=\"_blank\">Dauphine</a> on your TV, because live coverage of the Tour of Britain Women will only be available via the internet, with ITV4 showing daily highlights packages at 8pm each evening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Never fear though, because although the race will be streaming live on Discovery+ in the UK, Italy, Netherlands and Germany, on Max in the US, Scandinavia, Spain and central and eastern Europe, and on the Eurosport app in the rest of Europe, the Tour of Britain Women will be streamed live on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@britishcycling/streams\" target=\"_blank\">British Cycling’s YouTube page</a> for free. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coverage will be hosted by an all-women commentary team of Rebecca Charlton, Hannah Walker, Dani Rowe and Joanna Rowsell.
