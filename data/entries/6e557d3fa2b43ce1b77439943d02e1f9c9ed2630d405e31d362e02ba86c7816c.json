The more traditional bike shop element came later, in 2016, seeing the business through the tumult of Covid lockdowns and the various associated ravages on the bike industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the bike shop is open while the DIY element is closed, but Gwiazdowski is hoping to raise £15k by the end of May (25% complete at the time of writing), which will enable the DIY space to reopen with an energised new offering.  </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"776\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-01-776x970.jpg\" alt=\"London Bike Kitchen\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-01-776x970.jpg 776w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-01-240x300.jpg 240w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-01-768x960.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-01-750x938.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-01-1140x1425.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/london-bike-kitchen-01.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Fred MacGregor / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>LBK will continue to be a female and non-binary led operation that is first and foremost a place for riders to learn how to fix their own bikes. Going forward, in addition to Gwiazdowski, mechanics Amie, Silvi and Jamie will lead tutorials and supervise workshop hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once up and running, the workshop will allow punters access to a work stand, every tool imaginable, a parts washer and, of course, support from a mechanic. Funds raised will go towards clearing out the old workshop, installing new lighting, refreshing tool stocks, overheads and website redesign. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find out more at <a href=\"https://www.lbk.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">LBK’s website</a>, sign up for <a href=\"https://londonbikekitchen.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">the excellent Substack newsletter</a> or head straight to <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/bring-the-diy-workshop-back-to-life\" target=\"_blank\">the GoFundMe donation page</a>.  </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-team-staff-mechanic\">The people behind a WorldTour team #4: The mechanic</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sportive-bike-maintenance-checks\">RideLondon bike check: 5 maintenance tips and what to avoid ahead of the big day</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/london-bike-kitchen\">London Bike Kitchen: We’re here to fix things</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-mechanics\">On the road with the Tour de France mechanics</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/london-bike-kitchen-diy-workshop\">London Bike Kitchen is fundraising to reopen DIY bike workshop</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6e557d3fa2b43ce1b77439943d02e1f9c9ed2630d405e31d362e02ba86c7816c","category":"Cycling"}
