We have an article that explains <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675869/how-to-connect-two-or-more-external-displays-to-apple-silicon-m1-macs.html\">How to connect two or more external displays to an M1, M2, or M3 MacBook</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with the release of the M3 MacBook Air, Apple introduced a new feature for M3 laptops. These MacBooks can now run two external displays, but the laptop must be closed. It’s a handy feature for production environments or presentations. This feature is also available on the M3 MacBook Pro after installing the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2370203/macos-sonoma-14-6-features-security-fixes-install-html.html\">macOS Sonoma 14.6 update</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two external displays must support a video connection over USB-C or Thunderbolt 3. Also, the two displays can each be 5K at 60Hz, for example, two <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">Apple Studio Displays</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to use dual external displays on M3 MacBooks. This demonstration involves a 15-inch M3 MacBook Air, an Apple Studio Display, and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2195286/dough-spectrum-one-review.html\">Dough Spectrum One</a>, which is a 4K display with a variable refresh rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><div><div>At a glance </div></div><ul><li><span>Time to complete: </span><span>  3 minutes</span></li><li>Tools required: M3 MacBook, two external Thunderbolt/USB-C displays, external input devices</li></ul></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Get your Bluetooth input devices ready</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/magic-keyboard-mouse-trackpad-lightning.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Orange Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, Magic Keyboard\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>A closed laptop means you can’t use the MacBook’s keyboard and trackpad.

Plug the cables from the displays into the two <a></a><a>MacBook Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the M3 MacBooks have only two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, all of the ports on the laptop will be occupied. The Studio Display has three USB-C ports, so if you need to connect USB-C devices, you need to plug them into the Studio Display. If you are using non-Apple displays, they may have hub support built in. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>3.</span>\n<h3>Close the MacBook</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/m3-macbook-external-displays-laptop-closed.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"m3 macbook external displays laptop closed\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>The M3 MacBooks can run only two displays at a time–that includes the laptop display.
