These sophisticated pieces of malware hijack the UEFI—short for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface\">Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</a>—the low-level and complex chain of firmware responsible for booting up virtually every modern computer. As the mechanism that bridges a PC’s device firmware with its operating system, the UEFI is an OS in its own right. It’s located in an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface\">SPI</a>-connected flash storage chip soldered onto the computer motherboard, making it difficult to inspect or patch.</p>\n<p>Because the UEFI is the first thing to run when a computer is turned on, it influences the OS, security apps, and all other software that follows. These traits make the UEFI the perfect place to launch malware. When successful, UEFI bootkits disable OS security mechanisms and ensure that a computer remains infected with stealthy malware that runs at the kernel mode or user mode, even after the operating system is reinstalled or a hard drive is replaced.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921876#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921876&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5e00fe8643d45e57c60fc43a790248cb3147693e7838adf09ac68a6dab83e72e","category":"Tech"}
