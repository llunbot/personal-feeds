I say “American” because there are plenty of examples throughout history of balloon tire bikes with flat bars designed to traverse rough terrain, many of these bikes included racks and portage equipment to carry items for travel by bicycle.</p>\n<p>With their lifestyle-centric approach to marketing, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1978-breezer-series-i/\" target=\"_blank\">Californian personalities</a> of the era took components from <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1982-ritchey-tamalpais-review/\" target=\"_blank\">moto, touring, and BMX to assemble somewhat of a bricolage bicycle</a> designed to transport its owner deep into the backcountry. Many of the first production models of the early mountain bikes, like <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1983-ritchey-everest-restoration/\" target=\"_blank\">my Everest</a> (above), featured rack mounts for bicycle touring and bike camping.</p>\n<p><em>In a somewhat serendipitous, self-reflective, and referential manner, I made the notes for this very review on a ride up Mount Tam in Marin County late last summer with some friends, the very place where cruisers became klunkers, and the modern mountain bike was born…</em></p>\n<p>First and foremost, a mountain bike can have racks. This is nothing new. Those racks can hold panniers or bags and do not inhibit the bike’s ability to be absolutely shredded (albeit lightly) on legitimate singletrack. Granted, I do not ride my 1983 Everest in the same manner as I pilot the Tumbleweed Sunliner, but that’s because vintage bicycles were not built as robustly as their modern counterparts. They had considerably lighter-duty frame materials.</p>\n<p>We’ve come a long way in terms of chassis engineering in 40+ years.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Ponderosa-Adventure-Gravel-Bike-Review-01-1.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Ponderosa-Adventure-Gravel-Bike-Review-01-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Ponderosa-Adventure-Gravel-Bike-Review-01-1.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Ponderosa-Adventure-Gravel-Bike-Review-01-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Ponderosa-Adventure-Gravel-Bike-Review-01-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Chassis: Light vs. Heavy Duty</h3>\n<p>The Sunliner is a flat bar version of the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tumbleweed-stargazer-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Stargazer</a>, Tumbleweed’s flagship <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/drop-bar-29er-mountain-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">drop-bar 29er touring mountain bike</a>, with a few geometry tweaks to accommodate for the loss of extension “fit” when switching from drop bars with hoods to flat bars with levers. This includes a slightly longer top tube and an increase in stack. The Stargazer is still the bike to this day that I recommend to people who want <em>one drop bar bike that can do it all</em>.</p>\n<p>For gravel roads, doubletrack, and even light singletrack, the Stargazer can very much be wielded to great success on various surfaces. I jokingly called it a “mixed terrain bicycle,” or MTB, to someone once – referring to how people are willing to label a bicycle with fat tires an ATB without rhyme or reason or qualifiable classification – just to avoid calling it a mountain bike. But I digress – back to the bike at hand.</p>\n<p>Tumbleweed’s crowning achievement with the Sunliner comes down to two points: it is comfortable, so it is easy to control in rough terrain, and its tubeset is designed to carry a heavy load associated with fully loaded touring, but it still rides very mild-mannered when unloaded.</p>\n<p>Tumbleweed and their manufacturers have really nailed the tubing here!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/meriwether-ponderosa-gravel-bike-review/\" target=\"_blank\">My Meriwether Ponderosa</a> (above, right) is <em>not</em> a fully loaded touring bike. It’s lighter and flexier than the Stargazer, but what differentiates it is the chassis. Its light-duty chassis has more road DNA than MTB DNA since it’s not boost-spaced and features a road bottom bracket (68 mm wide).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-27.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-27.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-27.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-27.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-27.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The Stargazer and Sunliner are 148 mm boost-spaced with 73 mm bottom brackets, so they are mountain bikes.

Tumbleweed can actually built any size Sunliner with 27.5+ wheels, but they don’t recommend anything narrower than a 27.5 x 2.6” due to bottom bracket height concerns.</em></p>\n<h3>Run the Numbers: Sacred Geometry</h3>\n<p>Ride quality is as much about the tubing selection as it is geometry – and parts spec for that matter, which we’ll touch on in a bit – and the Sunliner offers one of the best geometries I’ve tested in this class. The bottom bracket drop of 65 mm is in line with a 29 x 2.6″ wheeled mixed terrain bicycle as I reviewed it here – while noting the Sunliner can fit up to a 3″ 29er tire – offering sure-footed pedaling without rock strikes on singletrack and even-keeled cornering, even when loaded down.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-58.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-58.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-58.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-58.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-58.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>I, a 6’2″ 190 lb human, somehow made this massive bike look relatively small!</em></p>\n<p>A 69º head and 73º seat angle aid in the Sunliner’s off-road prowess, and the 456 mm chainstays mean your rear panniers (if you choose to use them) will be heel-strike-free, even with my size 12 or 13 shoes (depending on flat or clipless pedals). Thank fucking god the Sunliner has an appropriate stack number for a non-suspension corrected bike!  The XL sports a glorious 664 mm stack with a 210 mm head tube. Nothing bums me out more than to have to put 4 – 6 cm of spacers under a bike like this to have it fit me. The tall head tube puts the bars level with the saddle – a must for any touring bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-12.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-12.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-12.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-12.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1334\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-10.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-10.jpg?w=1334&amp;quality=75 1334w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-10.jpg?resize=1200,1799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-10.jpg?resize=768,1151&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-10.jpg?resize=1025,1536&amp;quality=75 1025w\" /></p>\n<h3>Detailing</h3>\n<p>Racks rule. They really do. If you can buy a bike like the Sunliner and simply tighten down eight bolts to have a completely secure and painless off-road touring experience, why wouldn’t you? Bags that strap to your saddle rails and handlebars are great for many reasons but in my opinion, the optimized experience for touring on gravel or double/singletrack on a rigid mountain bike relies on front and rear racks. For riders that use smaller frames, no more hassle of having your saddle bag or handlebar pack hit your tires. Strap stuff to the top of the rack, or modern panniers to the sides. It’s easy.</p>\n<p>Lightweight panniers like the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/san-util-mini-and-light-weight-panniers-review/\" target=\"_blank\">San Util models</a> pictured here or the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/an-ode-to-bicycle-touring-a-look-at-buckhorn-bags-new-made-in-new-mexico-waxed-panniers/\" target=\"_blank\">Buckhorn</a> or <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/revelate-nano-panniers-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Revelate</a>, offer plenty of cargo capacity and keep the weight lower on the bike, making it easier to control off-road.

If the first mountain bikes were specced with rack mounts, it makes sense that modern bikes like the Sunliner also ought to. This is the main difference between a mountain touring bike and just a mountain bike; the latter doesn’t have rack mounts.</p>\n<p>Apologies for the digression. This is a passionate subject matter, but it’s a worthwhile note to make clearly. Bikes like this are exquisitely detailed for bicycle camping, sub-24-hour overnighters, short and long bicycle touring, and straight-up bicycle overlanding, like what Ryan Wilson is doing. If you want the best experience of all the above, go with a bike that is engineered to offer just that: <strong>the best possible experience</strong>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-39.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-39.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-39.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-39.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-39.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The Sunliner has cargo bosses on the fork blades, as well as fender, and rack mounts. The frame has cargo bosses under the downtube, as well as the seat tube, with water bottle bosses on the downtube and rack/fender mounts at the dropouts.

Whereas I’ll take bikes like the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/kona-sutra-ltd-review-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">Kona Sutra LTD</a> or my Meriwether Ponderosa on the more XC-friendly trails, I threw the Sunliner in head-first onto my more rocky “all-mountain” trails; rides I’d normally undertake on a hardtail or full-suspension bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-47.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-47.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-47.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-47.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-47.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Since the Sunliner is a heavy-duty chassis bike, meeting all necessary ISO or ASTM testing for mountain bike riding, I felt more comfortable jamming through our rocky chutes and glissading across chunder at top speed. There were plenty of “oh shit” moments during these rides but I was genuinely curious just how comfortable this “mountain” bike was in actual mountains.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-8-1.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-8-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-8-1.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-8-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-8-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>People get so swept up in angles these days, with seat tube angles being a <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/measuring-mtb-seat-tube-angles/\" target=\"_blank\">hot topic over here</a> and <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/otso-cycles-hoot-titanium-hardtail-review/\" target=\"_blank\">modern hardtails going to 77º</a> you might think a seat angle of 73º would suffer on steep switchback climbs.

Bolt on the racks, strap on some bags, and load them up, and it redefined what it means for a bike to be “sure-footed” on climbs. My theory is that having the weight both over the front and rear hubs aided in the “planted” sensation while climbing, and then it was all up to gearing and pilot strength to do the rest.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-53.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-53.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-53.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-53.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-53.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Cari for nailing these riding photos.

On a recent overnighter with Radavist co-owner and my better half, Cari Carmean, she kept calling me crazy as I flew through rock gardens that I’d normally ride a bit more reserved on a rigid bike.

Looking back to why chassis engineering matters so much, this is how the Sunliner is designed to be ridden and why when bikes aren’t designed to be abused like this, the brands will often add a disclaimer and use words like “lightweight tourer.”</p>\n<p><em>I wouldn’t dare ride a gravel bike like this with a full load on these trails. </em></p>\n<p>The Sunliner ain’t a lightweight tourer.

Simply adding a rack mount on a dropout does not by itself make a bike good for touring.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-People-27-1.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-People-27-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-People-27-1.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-People-27-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024-MADE-BIke-Show-People-27-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Daniel at the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2024-made-bike-show-people-and-products/\" target=\"_blank\">2024 MADE Bike Show in Portland</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>In my experience, a lot, but not all, of a bike’s perceived stiffness comes from its downtube diameter; what’s the diameter of the Sunliner’s downtube?</strong></p>\n<p><em>The downtube is one part of the equation, and ours is oversized (36.4mm) and reinforced where it counts. Our entire tubeset is oversized compared to most metal bikes designed for gravel or light-duty mountain biking, and the heat treating process also helps with stiffness and overall strength.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What are you most pleased with on this model?</strong></p>\n<p><em>For touring, I think the fit will be great for a lot of people. We gave the Sunliner quite a bit of stack for a flat bar bike, which offers a ton of latitude with cockpit positioning, and gives a monster front triangle since we decided to not to make it suspension corrected (98% of our customers don’t use suspension for touring and never will) for large volume framebags. This is our first bike model where you can just take an off-the-shelf wheelset and drivetrain and build it up. The Prospector and Stargazer are both a bit quirky in their own ways, mainly because I’m super opinionated about what a mountain touring bike should be and what I want to put my name on. The Sunliner ticks all of the boxes for me while being a bit more mainstream than our other models.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-11.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-11.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-11.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>What would you want to change in the future?</strong></p>\n<p><em>For all of our bikes, we do extensive long term testing and quite a few revisions of the pre production samples (usually over the course of at least a year), and we don’t release them into production until we iron out any potential kinks. What ends up happening is that we make a series of small evolutionary changes with each production run. We build up a bunch of them and agonize about little tweaks to the cable routing, or other design details that would make the bike 2% better, and anybody who doesn’t build them every day would never notice. I’m constantly tinkering with and thinking about the future of our bikes, frowning about novelty drivetrains, and lamenting the loss of mechanical components and standards. I’d love for SRAM to not give up on mechanical shifting. I’m strongly against components that become less user-serviceable and more proprietary, especially from a remote touring perspective.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Thanks, Daniel!</strong></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-2.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-2.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-2.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Tumbleweed-Sunliner-Touring-Bike-Review-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>The Rhubarb-colored Sunliner sitting pretty against a moody, monsoon sky…</em></p>\n<h3>TL;DR and the Wrap-Up</h3>\n<p>Tumbleweed’s flagship bike, the Prospector, led the brand to go all-in on bikes designed for fully loaded off-road touring. From there came the Stargazer, which is still best in class as far as I’m concerned. This inspired the Sunliner, a flat-bar counterpart.</p>\n<p>This stout, heavy-duty chassis tourer epitomizes the brand’s dedication to self-sufficient bicycle travel. Yet it’s not just for fully loaded exploits; the Sunliner excels as a rough-and-tumble trail sled, making even the most familiar singletrack trails more engaging.</p>\n<p>After nine months of having Daniel from Tumbleweed’s personal Sunliner build, I’ve put it through the wringer here in the Southern Rocky Mountains in Santa Fe both as an unloaded trail bike and a fully loaded camper. If there truly is a single bike for all things dirt, the Sunliner and Stargazer remain reigning champions of that space. It all depends on whether you prefer drop or flat bars.</p>\n<p><em>By the way, the Rhubarb color really grew on me!
