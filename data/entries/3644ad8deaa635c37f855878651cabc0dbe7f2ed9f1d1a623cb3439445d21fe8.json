Samsung is down 27 percent, in second place overall with 24 percent market share in Q2 2023. Motorola is next with a 25 percent decline and only 8 percent market share. TCL, a TV company that feels like it only briefly dabbled in smartphones, is the single biggest loser, down 30 percent, with 5 percent market share.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-980x776.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3.jpg\"></a> (credit: <a href=\"https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/north-american-smartphone-market-Q2-2023\">Canalys</a>)</p></div>\n<p>Only a single company survived this quarter unscathed, and it's actually Google! The company might be at the bottom of the smartphone charts, but Pixel phone sales are up 59 percent, earning Google 4 percent of the market. It was the same story last year, when Google jumped from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/google-pixel-sees-huge-sales-growth-has-2-of-north-american-market/\">1 to 2 percent</a>. In a few quarters, the company might hit fourth place.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971434#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971434&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3644ad8deaa635c37f855878651cabc0dbe7f2ed9f1d1a623cb3439445d21fe8","category":"Tech"}
