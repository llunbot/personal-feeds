{"title":"Life after racing - why I'm training to be a doctor, by Max Walscheid","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/i-know-where-my-future-lies-beyond-pro-cycling-by-max-walscheid","date":1736249953000,"content":"\n      <p><span>It might be a little bit cheesy and I don’t want to sound like a hero, but nothing is worth anything if you’re not healthy and I think helping people with ill health is the highest good you can do. Working as a doctor has been my ambition since I left school – in fact, I didn’t ever think about being a pro cyclist as I don’t come from a family of sportspeople and I never knew anybody who earned a living from sports. My parents and older sister are also doctors so you could say it runs in the family. </span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>Before you start a medical degree in Germany you have to do a three-month internship in a hospital, so I did that when I was 19 in 2012. I began university in Heidelberg, and was riding as an U23 rider for a small Continental team, Stölting. Cycling was a big passion, but I was a full-time student and could only participate in one or two stage races a season because I had to attend so many courses. At the weekends I was racing a fair bit, but during the week I was at uni most of the time. In Germany, it’s very difficult to combine studying with having a proper job – no one gives a fuck about you being a sportsperson. I’m not whining, but the mentality is that you don't compete in sports at a professional level alongside your studies.</span></p>\n<p><span>That all changed, though, in my last U23 year when I joined a different Conti team, Kuota-Lotto. I went from full-time to part-time studying and suddenly there were options on the horizon for me to turn pro. In 2016 I joined Giant-Alpecin, and though I did continue studying for a little bit while I was out injured after a crash at a team winter camp, I had to eventually pause my studies during my first years as a pro because I was so busy with being a professional cyclist that everything was overwhelming. </span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/RLR_InMyWords_MaxWalscheid_WebImage1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1736182157\" alt=\"Max Walscheid\" /></div>\n<p><span>I broke my hand at Paris-Nice in 2020, right before Covid hit, and I was at home unable to train properly and not even sure what I would be training for, so when I learned that my uni would be doing online classes, I decided to restart my studies. I was really scared to go back after a couple of years away and I had the feeling that I’d forgotten almost everything, but it was the right decision. It was definitely stressful, but I realised I was still interested in it and enjoyed it. My team in 2020 and 2021 was Qhubeka and it was good to be working again towards a back-up career given the uncertainty over their future.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are two degrees I have to complete overall. The first major degree – the first </span><i><span>staatsexamen</span></i><span> – I have completed and I have to complete a couple of other courses before I can register for the second and last degree, the second </span><i><span>staastsexamen</span></i><span>. Think of it as needing to complete a Bachelor’s degree before you start a Master’s. If I started studying full-time now, it would take me one more year of studying and one year of practical experience as an assistant doctor until I can officially call myself a doctor. But because I’m fitting it all in around my cycling, it’ll take a little bit longer.</span></p>\n<p><span>I’ve done a few internships over the years and do a little bit of practical experience every year in hospitals to slowly gain experience, but I definitely need more. Last winter I was studying neurology and I needed to do some practical training before I passed the exam. I was in an emergency department and went into a room with a patient with multiple sclerosis, and the real doctor said to me: ‘OK, do the check up, I’ll be back in 10 minutes’. I was like: Oh my God, I hardly know the theory, but now I’m in the real world, this person is very sick, and I have to do a full neuro status of them despite having zero experience. In the end it worked out fine, but I was so scared. </span></p>\n<p><span>At the moment I don’t know what field I’d want to specialise in and I’d like to do practical time in all professions before I make a decision. Choosing a specialisation in medicine is not only about what interests you: being a surgeon, for example, would be nice but it would mean mostly giving up your private life and I’m not ready for a job that requires 100% of your capacity. I’d also be happy to start as a general doctor, but I also want to stay involved in cycling. I don’t think an ex-pro has ever become a cycling team doctor before so that could be interesting for me, and I think I’d have high credibility from the riders because I’ve been a pro. I have a lot of respect for team doctors because though 95% of the time it’s the same issues – saddle sores, respiratory infections, wounds from crashes – the other 5% of the time it could be absolutely anything so you need to be able to understand all of professional medicine to judge the problem and treatment.</span></p>\n<p><span>Throughout my career I’ve not spoken much about my studies because I wasn’t very eager to be seen as the wannabe doctor. I’ve wanted to be taken as Max Walscheid the pro cyclist, a very solid WorldTour cyclist for 10 years. But Jayco-Alula has been a dream for me because they’re really interested in it and encourage me to speak about it.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/RLR_InMyWords_MaxWalscheid_WebImage2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1736182211\" alt=\"Max Walscheid\" /></div>\n<p><span>I also think that most other pros would benefit from having experience in other work settings – it doesn’t have to be a degree, it could be education as a car mechanic. I see now how professional U23 riders are getting, but how poorly they perform socially and in normal life. I am one of the last guys who had a pretty non-professional amateur period, and I had so much fun on weekends and in the off-season. Now they think they have to put all their energy into living like a pro – why would they start an education, they say, as it would hinder their performance – but I don’t agree that’s the right approach. When you learn how to put a car together or write an essay, you have a little bit more credibility for yourself and you know your purpose. Having that alongside your cycling gives you more self-confidence and I am convinced makes you a happier and better rider.</span></p>\n<p><span>I’ve reached a point in my career where I’ve figured out what I am able to achieve and not able to achieve. I’d like to go back to the Tour next year; it’d be nice to be national champion; and Roubaix is always on my mind as it’s the one Monument I’m able to potentially win. Once my career ends, though, I know where my future lies. </span></p>\n<p><strong><em> - Max</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>You can read more from the In My Words series <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/in-my-words\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"a92d7402f223f9f7f6791ffa22ccd15c55418777bd2083b1c4bb2b8b567ec6bf","category":"Cycling"}
