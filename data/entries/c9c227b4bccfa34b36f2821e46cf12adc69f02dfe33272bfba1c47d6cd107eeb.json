You can type in whatever you like, but Apple will suggest costumes, locations, and items that you can add to an image. You can generate images that resemble your friend and family, and you can choose a photo for ‌Image Playground‌ to use as inspiration.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe update also adds ChatGPT integration to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, which is an opt-in feature. When enabled, ‌Siri‌ is able to hand complicated requests over to OpenAI's ChatGPT. ‌Siri‌ ChatGPT can essentially do much of what the dedicated ChatGPT app can do, but with the convenience of using ‌Siri‌ instead of a third-party app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChatGPT can generate text and realistic looking images from scratch, which isn't possible with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, and it can tell you what you're looking at on your screen using a screenshot.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.2 also adds new features to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> and Safari, with Apple's release notes for the update available below.\r<br />\n<blockquote>This update introduces new features powered by Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that unlocks powerful new ways to communicate, work, and express yourself, all while protecting your data with an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNew features include Image Playground which lets you create delightful, fun images, ChatGPT support integrated right into Siri and Writing Tools, and more. This release also includes enhancements to Photos and Safari, as well as other features, bug fixes, and security updates for your Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome features may not be available for all regions, or on all Apple devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor detailed information about the security content of this update, please visit: https://support.apple.com/100100</blockquote>\r<br />\nMore information on the features that are new in ‌macOS Sequoia‌ can be found in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">our macOS Sequoia roundup</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-macos-sequoia-15-2/\">Apple Releases macOS Sequoia 15.2 With New Apple Intelligence Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-macos-sequoia-15-2-with-new-apple-intelligence-features.2445117/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c9c227b4bccfa34b36f2821e46cf12adc69f02dfe33272bfba1c47d6cd107eeb","category":"Apple"}
