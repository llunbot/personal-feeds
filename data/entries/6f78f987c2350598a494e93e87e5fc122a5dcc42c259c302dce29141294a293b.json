At the time, fixed-gear bicycles were very fashionable, and as an Italian looking at the American cycling panorama through a screen, I was amazed at how components for racing road bicycles (Campagnolo, Masi, Colnago, Cinelli, etc…) were considered valuable and rare objects by American cyclists, while the same components where I live can literally be found abandoned among the garbage bins.</p>\n<p>Then the years passed and things changed. Today, I observe that track or racing bicycles are less fashionable, the local cycling panoramas are merging with each other and together they give life to a single global panorama.</p>\n<p>It also seems to me that today the cycling world has an interest in the “old” (vintage) Mountain Bikes. I realize that in Italy very little is found or known about them, while I imagine that in America it is possible to easily find a lot of material. I imagine that in America it is as easy to find a 90s Cannondale MTB as it is to find a 70s Colnago road bike here.</p>\n<p>Off-road bicycles came onto the scene in Italy when I was a child and were immediately termed “Mountain Bikes,” using the English name, and everyone pronounced it as they saw fit (“mountain baik”). They were extravagant bicycles, for extravagant people, a novelty, a trend.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0714-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0714-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0714-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0714-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0714-scaled.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0714-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0714-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0714-scaled.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0714-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0714-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>I don’t think that the large and prestigious Italian manufacturers of components and bicycles wanted to invest much in these new bicycles and, today, after many years the most important and recognized companies in the MTB sector are American.</p>\n<p>Nevi is certainly among the most famous and prestigious Italian manufacturers of handcrafted titanium frames. The brand has been on the market for a long time and produces, in particular, racing bikes but today also offers very high-end MTBs and Gravel bikes in its catalog.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0708-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0708-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0708-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0708-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0708-scaled.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0708-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0708-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0708-scaled.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0708-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0708-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Perhaps it is difficult to notice the similarity from the photos, also due to the different fork mounted, but the two frames are practically identical in terms of geometries and technical solutions, in particular for the steering tube which must house Cannondale’s proprietary system “fatty” fork and which it certainly required specific studies and tubes from the craftsman at Nevi. Today the shape (geometry) of this frame may seem common, but at the time it was very different from all the others on the market.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0712-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0712-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0712-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0712-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0712-scaled.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0712-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0712-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0712-scaled.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0712-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0712-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>A customer sought out Nevi to create a customized titanium frame in an attempt to reproduce what, at the time, could be considered among the most innovative and effective frames on the market; a true American novelty. At the time in Italy a high-quality Cannondale cost as much as a small F.I.A.T. car.</p>\n<p>The bike was fitted with high-end American SRAM X0 components with grip shift controls and an American seat tube. German disc brakes, high-quality Italian handcrafted double crankset and Italian saddle, American handlebars, and many fine details in the small parts.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0707-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0707-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0707-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0707-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0707-scaled.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0707-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0707-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0707-scaled.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0707-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/IMG_0707-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Today this bicycle, which at the time was prepared for racing, has been converted by me into a bicycle for travel, bikepacking exploration and easy off-road fun.
