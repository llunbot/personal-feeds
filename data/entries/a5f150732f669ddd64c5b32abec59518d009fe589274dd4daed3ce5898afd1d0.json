This remains the lowest price we've tracked on this model, and as of writing Amazon is the only major Apple reseller offering this discount.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/14in-MacBook-Pro-Deals-Red-Orange.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

The 14-inch MacBook Pro (8-Core M1 Pro, 512GB) is available for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQSLL92%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$1,949.99</strong></a>, down from $1,999.00, but it won't ship until late November. The same estimate can be found for the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQML3NL%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">1TB 16-inch model</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis will likely continue to be a trend as we head further into the holiday season, as Apple's own website has most models of the 2021 MacBook Pro shipping in late November and early December. If you're looking at these for holiday presents, the earlier you order the more you'll ensure a timely delivery.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYou can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-pro-air-deals/\">Best Deals guide</a> for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.
