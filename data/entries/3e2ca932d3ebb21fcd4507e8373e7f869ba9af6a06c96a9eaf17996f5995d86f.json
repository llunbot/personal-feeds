The tire cradles open wide, extending to the ground to create mini-ramps leading onto the tire trays. As you push the bike onto the rack and into the opposite tire cradle, it rocks back to level and locks into position so you can secure the rear wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire rack is overbuilt to handle heavy bikes, up to 100lbs per tray with a total static tongue weight of 280lbs (including the rack itself, which weighs 52-82lbs depending on number of trays).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1093\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-2.jpg\" alt=\"QuietKat pivot pro hitch rack with tilting design for easy e-bike loading\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-2.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-2-297x180.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-2-800x486.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-2-120x73.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-2-768x466.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-2-1536x933.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While it was made with QuietKat’s fat-tired e-mountain bikes in mind, they say it works great for everything from kids bikes to road bikes to DH MTBs, too, from 24″ to 29″ wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"471\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-1.jpg\" alt=\"QuietKat pivot pro hitch rack with tilting design for easy e-bike loading\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-1.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-1-297x78.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-1-800x209.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-1-120x31.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-1-768x201.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-1-1536x402.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tire cradles use a quiet, ratchet-less design that opens and closes without any clickety-clackety sounds. The mostly steel construction and heavy-duty pivot points should keep the rest of the rack quiet and solid, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1976\" height=\"1318\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-3.jpg\" alt=\"QuietKat pivot pro hitch rack with tilting design for easy e-bike loading\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-3.jpg 1976w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-3-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-3-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/quietkat-pivot-pro-tilting-hitch-rack-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s available in 1-bike and 2-bike configurations for 2″ hitches only.
