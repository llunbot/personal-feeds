An achievement of immense magnitude, some might say is at least the cycling equivalent of Roger Bannisters sub-four-minute mile in 1954. While Bannister achieved what many considered physiologically impossible at the time and broke down an apparent collective mental barrier for humanity, there was a certain inevitability about someone, sometime soon, breaking the four-minute 4km pursuit barrier.</p><p>That is not to detract from Lambie’s achievement but is rather a collective acknowledgement of the progression in modern sport. The sub-four-minute pursuit became an equation; massive human engine + sports science and physiology understanding + technological advancement = 3:59.930</p><p>Lambie has the engine, the biggest part by far of that whole equation. His team has an advanced understanding of physiology and advancements in training, and this bike provided the platform to deliver all that potential onto the board of the Aguascalientes track. We have these photos of Lambie’s groundbreaking bike to attempt to encapsulate all that tech advancement into one gallery from photographer Kit Karzen.</p><p>So find yourself a quiet place, sit back, marvel at this “giant leap for mankind” level of advancement, and ponder the fact that for 99.999% of us, all the marginal gains in the world still wouldn’t have been enough to keep us on the same lap as Lambie.</p><figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-8-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>If it looks like a fast bike, and it goes like a fast bike, its not a duck! Lambie rode an Argon18 Electron Pro Tko Pursuit frameset, a cool £7,999 per frame.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-10-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Zipp is a relatively new sponsor for Lambie and live streamed the record breaking ride on its Instagram account. Lambie used the Zipp Super 9 discs front and rear. £2,800 x 2, front and rear.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-2-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Lambie rides with the Huub-Wattbike team and has a the full catalog, and then some, of Wattshop optimisation products to choose from. One of the most notable upgrades to the bike are these Wattshop Cractus Aero cranks at a cool £1,595 a set. The crank’s aerodynamic profile is said to reduce turbulence and separation around the spider, crankarm, and chainring. Hidden beneath that aero exterior is a huge 140bcd (bolt circle diameter), an incredibly narrow 132mm q-factor, and adjustable crankarm length.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-24-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>We are reliably informed Lambie opted for a 64 tooth chainring (paired to a 15 tooth sprocket). The Wattshop Cractus chainrings are said to be infused with a low-friction additive for improved drivetrain efficiency.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-3-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>That chain, in case you are wondering, is a KMC x101, no doubt with some form of optimising wax treatment.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-1-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Many of the Huub-Waatbike team opt for Speedplay pedals for lower stack height and the claimed improved aerodynamics, but Lambie sticks with the Look Keo platform, the aero penalty, if any, must be fairly small given the aero look of Look’s blade pedal. Look Look Keo Blade Carbon Ceramic – £180</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-6-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Lambie was perched on an ISM PN 1.1 saddle. The PN 1.1 is ISM’s softer padding option, measure 110mm wide, and features ISM signature stubby two-prong/cut out, nose-less front. ISM PN 1.1 – £150</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-4-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>A saddle’s role in maintaining an aero position is often overlooked. Too much pressure on the pressure on the perineal area will eventually force a rider out of position or to over load other areas leading to quicker fatigue onset.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-7-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>If Lambie wanted a warm up for his arms and shoulders, he could have got it pumping these Vittoria Pista Oro tyres. Again we are reliably informed Lambie had the maximum 15 bar (215 psi) in both tyres for the record breaking ride. Pista Oro tyres – £174 each</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-9-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Lambie looked warped after the ride, needing assistance to first get off the bike and then lower himself to the ground. Emptying the tank – priceless.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-11-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>A little customisation goes a long way.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-12-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-13-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>You go wide, we’ll stay narrow. Argon18 has stuck with the narrow is fast design philosophy.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-14-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-15-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>The pièce de résistance? If the Cractus cranks are next level, the Wattshop Anemoi Olympic Edition Pentaxia Cockpit is arguably next galaxy. Even with a claimed mahussive 36w saving at 64kph versus the far from standard Argon18 Electron Pro cockpit, it’s still hard to fathom an £8,500 track-only handlebar. That is what we are looking at though. The Pentaxia base bar is only compatible with the Argon18 frame and measures in at 37cm wide. The aero extensions are an evolution of the Wattshop Anemoi extensions are designed to within a hairs width of the UCI regulations, with an aero profile to smooth out the transition from extension to the rider’s arm, an off centred two-finger grip to maximise the height of the extension within the UCI 10cm rule, 15° armrest angle, and high sided arm rest walls for added support.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-27-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-16-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>If no one has yet done so, I hear by name these pinky grips.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-18-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Like an F1 wing for your forewarms.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-19-of-27-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Ah here, wait a minute!

Vortez is the British brand providing many top performing track athletes with clothing specifically designed to perform best at the incredible speeds riders are now hitting. Lambie will have opted a suit fastest at 60+KPH, that might not be the fastest for the rest of us going much slower than that. Here we have the much talked about £600 overshoes from Vorteq.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2-ashton-lambie-4-minute-4k-bike-4-of-4-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>No motors here, they checked!</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure><p>So there we have it, the world’s first 3:59 4km pursuit bike.
