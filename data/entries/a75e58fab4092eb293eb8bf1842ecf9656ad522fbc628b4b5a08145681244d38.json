If none of those options are suitable, you can feed the end of a screwdriver through the two slotted holes and use the tool to turn the nut.</p>\n<p>Although Look opts for an integrated seat clamp located on the top face of the top tube, it has chosen a larger T30 Torx bolt.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Look 795 Blade RS seatpost and Selle Italia saddle\" title=\"Look 795 Blade RS seatpost and Selle Italia saddle\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Thumbs up for the T30 Torx bolt.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott Windsor / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Most manufacturers use a smaller 4mm hex bolt or, if they go with Torx, it’ll typically be a T25 size. The larger T30 bolt will be harder to round and allow for more purchase on the bolt.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for a full review of the Look 795 Blade RS soon.</p>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a75e58fab4092eb293eb8bf1842ecf9656ad522fbc628b4b5a08145681244d38","category":"Cycling"}
