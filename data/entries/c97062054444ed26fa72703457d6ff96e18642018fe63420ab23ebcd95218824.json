A total of 68 people in 16 states have been infected with a rare, extensively drug-resistant <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> strain linked to the eye drops. In addition to the deaths, eight people have reported vision loss and four have had their eyeballs surgically removed (enucleation).</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2802947\">a case report</a> published this week in JAMA Ophthalmology, eye doctors at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, part of the University of Miami Health System, reported details of one case linked to the outbreakâ€”a case in a 72-year-old man who has an ongoing infection in his right eye with vision loss, despite weeks of treatment with multiple antibiotics. When the man first sought treatment he reported pain in his right eye, which only had the ability to detect motion at the point, while his left eye had 20/20 vision. Doctors noted that the white of his right eye was entirely red and white blood cells had visibly pooled on his cornea and in the front inner chamber of his eye.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926844#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926844&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c97062054444ed26fa72703457d6ff96e18642018fe63420ab23ebcd95218824","category":"Tech"}
