Very few of those riders go on to landing a double backflip. But a quadruple? That’s just nuts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or it’s just the natural progression of the sport when you’re as dedicated as Christian Arehart. Following Jed Mildon’s quad flip on a BMX bike in 2015, Christian just became the first person to land a quad flip on a mountain bike. The jump went down at Mid America Outdoors after Christian drove his own ramp cross-country to take on the challenge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After dialing it in on the airbags, Christian landed the quad flip to the massive resi landing. Clearly a quad flip <em>is</em> possible. Will we see more in the future?</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/christian-arehart-lands-the-first-ever-quadruple-backflip-on-an-mtb/\">Christian Arehart Lands the First Ever Quadruple Backflip on MTB</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"3553e3b5d750b945e0ce65c196999ebae64f78e0b7e70f79f98ac348506fcb18","category":"Cycling"}
