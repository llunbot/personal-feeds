A slimmer, lighter model than the Karoo 1, Hammerhead has focused on the experience cyclists actually want from a computer, with the Karoo 2 also being the choice of Chris Froome and his team Israel Start-Up Nation.</p>\n<p>Here’s a rundown of the five standout features of the Karoo 2 – ranging from a 3.2in touchscreen to the ability to carry a SIM card and make use of mobile data on the go, there’s a lot to be excited about.</p>\n<h2>A stunning screen</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The computer features a high-resolution, full-colour screen.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Hammerhead</i></span></div>\n<p>The 3.2in display is a key feature of the Karoo 2. The high-quality screen has a colour spectrum similar to a smartphone and a resolution of 292 PPI. This is especially useful for providing finely detailed mapping, which could make it perfect for off-road adventurers.</p>\n<p>The computer also features a touchscreen interface that’s paired with buttons on the side of the device. These buttons will come in handy when fine motor control is limited – when riding on rough terrain, in heavy rain or when wearing thick gloves, for example.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are also buttons on either side of the computer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Hammerhead</i></span></div>\n<p>Additionally, the touchscreen gives you the ability to move around the map easily. Pinching to zoom in and out, and dragging to move around the map adds flexibility when you’re out riding.</p>\n<p>The screen itself is protected from wear and tear by toughened scratch-resistant Dragontrail glass, and despite the screen size and quality, the Karoo 2 offers a battery life of up to 12 hours.</p>\n<p>Beyond maps and routes, the screen will also display a new Karoo 2 feature – Climber.</p>\n<p>This provides information on climb gradient profile, distance and elevation remaining, as well as your current VAM while climbing. Whether you use it as a training tool, for racing or exploring your local climbs, it’s a feature that data lovers will embrace.</p>\n<h2>Seamless integration</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The computer syncs with all common training and route-planning apps.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Hammerhead</i></span></div>\n<p>If you’re a data lover, you’ll also appreciate the Karoo 2’s seamless integration with all of your favourite apps.</p>\n<p>It’s compatible with Strava Live Segments for those chasing KOMs and QOMs. For riders working with structured training plans, the Karoo 2 can also pair with apps such as Training Peaks to bring sessions to life on your computer.</p>\n<p>Route loading is also straightforward and user-friendly, integrating with all the major apps with ease.</p>\n<h2>Excellent customer support</h2>\n<p>Investing in a new cycle computer can be a stressful experience, but Hammerhead offers the Karoo 2 with a 45-day satisfaction guarantee, allowing you to return it if you’re not satisfied.</p>\n<p>If you’re in need of help or have a problem, Hammerhead also offers responsive customer support services, along with a useful and thorough set of help articles on its website, with step-by-step how-to guidance.</p>\n<h2>Continuous enhancement</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Climber is one of the latest features to be added to the Karoo 2.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Hammerhead</i></span></div>\n<p>Continuous development from the Hammerhead team means the Karoo 2 comes with regular software updates, with the device’s capabilities and user experience continually evolving and improving.</p>\n<p>This helps to keep it at the cutting edge of cycle computer technology, with new updates rolled out every two weeks, keeping everything fresh and functional.</p>\n<h2>Full connectivity</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The computer can also sync with smart trainers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Hammerhead</i></span></div>\n<p>The Hammerhead Karoo 2 features full Bluetooth and ANT+ connectivity, allowing you to pair it with all common external sensors. It will also pair with most turbo trainers and can even work with electronic groupsets such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-di2-or-sram-etap/\">SRAM eTap or Shimano Di2</a>.</p>\n<p>Going beyond Bluetooth and ANT+ connectivity, the Karoo 2 also features a SIM card slot.</p>\n<p>This gives it the capacity to work independently of your phone, with the computer directly accessing mobile data.</p>\n<p>If you have paired it with a phone, you can also receive notifications through the Karoo 2.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Shop for the latest Hammerhead Karoo 2 deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.hammerhead.io/?UTM_Source=bikeradar&amp;UTM_Medium=editorial\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Karoo 2 direct from Hammerhead</a></li>\n</ul>","author":"Alice Thomson","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"b9632a83d77a07d8b8c6fb53cec10ef3f9ae15278c41b0f9f1333e3eddb6d026","category":"Cycling"}
