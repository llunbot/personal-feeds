All with the brand’s signature polished aesthetic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-sprint-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-sprint-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Trail DH collection sprint\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-sprint-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-sprint-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-sprint-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-sprint-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-sprint-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-sprint-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-sprint-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Named after the infamous trails of Finale Ligure, the Trail Finale collection steps up as Rapha’s first dedicated gravity MTB range. The brand’s been dabbling in the dirt since 2021, but this launch shows they’re serious about going toe-to-toe with the established heavy hitters in DH and enduro apparel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Trail DH collection\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Who’s Riding Rapha for Gravity?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Years ago, if you told me that Rapha would have a gravity/DH line, I would have asked if it was an April Fool’s joke. The brand has undergone significant changes over the years and with the most recent change of ownership, Rapha is expanding its off-road offerings, gaining traction with the mountain crowd that appreciates the brand’s distinctive aesthetic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-front--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-front--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Trail DH collection front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-front--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-front--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-front--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-front--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-front--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-front--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-front--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, gravity and DH are their own subcultures, not something a brand can casually dabble in and make a quick buck. Much like a good DH run, you have to go all in and show the world that you’re committed.   </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-hike--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1441\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-hike--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Trail DH collection hike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-hike--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-hike--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-hike--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-hike--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-hike--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-hike--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-hike--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>So, will it hold up?</em></strong> So far, the gear has been pushed and punished by elite racers like Ella Conolly, Miranda Miller, Mariano Mari, and Megan Giblin. Their feedback directly informed the final designs, refining fit, function, and durability for a lifetime between the tape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Trail Finale is made for full-speed riding in high-pressure conditions,” says Rapha CPO Joel Natale. “It’s built to last a season, not just a stage.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-jersey-.png\"><img width=\"1088\" height=\"1166\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-jersey-.png\" alt=\"Rapha Trail DH collection jersey\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-jersey-.png 1088w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-jersey--280x300.png 280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-jersey--112x120.png 112w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-jersey--768x823.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Trail Finale Windblock Jersey</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed for unpredictable weather and all-day efforts, this race-fit jersey pairs windproof and splash-resistant panels with a super-light, breathable base fabric. The cut’s been tweaked for gravity — longer in the back, roomier sleeves, and a redesigned collar that sits right even with a neck brace or chest protector. <strong>Price: </strong>$135</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-pants-.png\"><img width=\"1108\" height=\"1242\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-pants-.png\" alt=\"Rapha Trail DH collection pants\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-pants-.png 1108w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-pants--268x300.png 268w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-pants--107x120.png 107w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-pants--768x861.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Trail Finale Pants &amp; Shorts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Building on Rapha’s existing trail bottoms, the Finale versions offer tighter tailoring for reduced flap at speed and increased space in the knees for pads. The new side-mounted waistband system stays out of the way when you’re tucked or standing tall. Cordura reinforcements guard the high-wear zones (think seat and shin), and clever pocket placement makes snack and tool access easy without digging mid-descent. <strong>Prices: </strong>$165 (shorts), $230 (pants)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-glove-.png\"><img width=\"1746\" height=\"1540\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-glove-.png\" alt=\"Rapha Trail DH collection glove\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-glove-.png 1746w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-glove--297x262.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-glove--1536x1355.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-glove--120x106.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-glove--768x677.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Trail Finale Gloves</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Forget fiddly fasteners — these are your go-fast, no-fuss gloves with a minimalist feel and pro-level grip. The palm features recycled suede for all-weather traction, and Cordura reinforces the top hand to protect against trail rash from stray branches or the occasional off-the-bike or over-the-bars (OTB) incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: </strong>$50</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-gloves--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-gloves--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Rapha Trail DH collection gloves\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-gloves--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-gloves--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-gloves--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-gloves--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-gloves--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-gloves--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rapha-Trail-DH-collection-gloves--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gravity-Ready, Race-Focused</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trail Finale kit pairs with Rapha’s existing Trail Knee Pads and Short Liners, allowing you to build a complete race-day system from head to toe. And if you’re wondering whether this kit holds up when the timing chip’s running — ask Ella Conolly, who snagged a win at the Loudenvielle round of the UCI Enduro World Cup last weekend while rocking Trail Finale head to ankle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Available now in select markets.
