When BikeRadar quizzed RockShox on the reason for sticking with 700c, it told us the reason gravel riders usually opt for </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-650b/\"><span>650b wheels</span></a><span> is to take advantage of the extra tyre volume the smaller wheel size allows for, and thus extra comfort, but a suspension fork takes care of that.</span></p>\n<p><span>You also get the increased rolling speed afforded by a larger diameter wheel – plus the Rudy offers a massive 50mm of clearance for 700c tyres.</span></p>\n<p><span> It will, of course, be possible to still unofficially run a 650b wheel in the fork, but this could affect front-end geometry and handling.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The fork is designed around 700c wheels, with clearance for 50mm gravel tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>RockShox says this is a completely new fork – not a slimmed-down </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/2021-rockshox-sid-ultimate-fork-review/\"><span>SID mountain bike fork</span></a><span> or an old model reinstated. </span></p>\n<p><span>The design features 30mm upper tubes to make for a lightweight unit, fixed to an all-alloy machined and anodised crown. For comparison, most modern </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-suspension-forks/\"><span>mountain bike forks</span></a><span> use stanchions that are 34mm, 36mm or 38mm in diameter (the SID is 35mm) depending on their intended use.</span></p>\n<p><span> The fork is compatible with three-bolt, short arch-mounted fenders, but it will also take a full fender (mudguard) because the fork lowers have eyelets too.</span></p>\n<p><span>Internally, the Rudy uses a new version of the Charger Race Day damper usually found in the SID. It’s RockShox’ lightest-ever damper unit and is matched to a Solo air spring that’s tuned for short travel to complement the Rudy’s 30mm and 40mm options. It all runs on Maxima Plush damping fluid. </span></p>\n<p><span>The Solo air spring, by the way, is a RockShox design that uses a single Schrader air valve to charge both positive and negative spring chambers simultaneously, making for a fast setup. It’s also the lightest air spring on the market.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-set-up-your-mountain-bike-suspension-video-guides-to-help-you-get-the-most-from-your-bike/\"><span>Suspension fork setup</span></a><span> will be a mysterious new world to a lot of gravel riders coming from the road. Like all RockShox forks, the Rudy comes with the usual air pressure settings (by rider weight) on the lowers and the Rudy specifications will be added to the clever Trail Head app, too.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>The system has been designed with a ‘bottomless’ feel, according to RockShox, ramping up resistance before you get a tell-tale clunk. The maximum of 40mm of travel may seem minimal to mountain bikers, but RockShox claims it won’t suffer from any clumsy bottoming out, even on high-speed hits. </span><span>The fork comes with a lockout for tarmac sections. </span></p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/SRAM-RockShox-XPLR-32-97e70e5.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The fork comes with a lockout to stiffen things up on road sections.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/SRAM-RockShox-XPLR-31-07817fc.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Schrader air valve to charge both positive and negative spring chambers simultaneously.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span>As standard, it has a 45mm offset and is designed around bikes with a 405mm to 410mm axle-to-crown length, so it’s worth checking your gravel bike’s geometry before taking the upgrade plunge. </span>\n<p><span>The Rudy’s claimed weight is 1.3kg but that’s dependent on steerer tube length/options.

Both are cable-actuated, so your bike needs dropper-compatible routing and a remote control mounted on your bar.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Reverb AXS XPLR, however, works wirelessly and is powered by a standard eTap battery mounted on the rear of the seatpost. Actuation is via the bike’s AXS shifters; in 1x configuration (as SRAM’s XPLR drivetrain is set up) you press both buttons at the same time to operate the post. </span></p>\n<p><span>It’ll work the same way with a 2x system if you set up sequential shifting through the AXS app, which takes care of front ring shifts automatically, therefore freeing up the double-button function for the dropper. </span></p>\n<p><span>The Reverb is compatible with all AXS levels from third-tier Rival, through Force and up to top-of-the-range SRAM Red eTap shifters.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Reverb AXS XPLR is based on the clever wireless </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/seatpost-and-seat-pin/rockshox-reverb-axs-wireless-dropper-post-review/\"><span>Reverb AXS mountain bike dropper post</span></a><span>, but in a gravel bike-friendly 27.2mm diameter. </span></p>\n<p><span>Unlike its mountain bike inspiration, however, the XPLR model is stripped down and lighter: the 400mm option with 75mm of travel is 597g with battery, while the 350mm post with 50mm of travel is 567g with battery (the mountain bike Reverb AXS is 650g). </span><span>It’s a suspension post, too, which we’ll come on to. </span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM, RockShox and Zipp’s XPLR collection is designed to allow riders to fine-tune their gravel setup depending on the type of riding they do.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>There are also key differences between the gravel and MTB droppers beyond weight. </span></p>\n<p><span>First, the internals are air only (Reverb AXS for mountain bikes is an air/oil shock, which makes the unit heavier and more complex), with RockShox saying it’s been designed this way as the XPLR Reverb is more than just a dropper. </span></p>\n<p><span>When the post is fully extended (set at your correct saddle height), it’s rock-solid and fully locked out, but by dropping the post even a few millimetres you’ll add some suspension into the mix. </span></p>\n<p><span>The post’s ‘Activeride’ feature allows what are effectively air shock internals to work like rear suspension. Of course, it’ll also drop all the way down and out of the way for technical terrain (or if you want to get into a super-tuck on a descent). </span></p>\n<p><span>Through the AXS app you’ll also be able to customise the post’s setup, so that means if you’re running Force AXS or Red AXS with additional ‘blip’ remote buttons, you can assign these to operate the Reverb.</span></p>\n<p><span>The post will be available in 350mm (50mm travel) and 400mm lengths (50mm and 75mm travel options). The newly-designed head is compatible with both 7×10mm oval rails and 7×9mm oval or round seat rails, so it should fit all types of saddle rails, including carbon.</span></p>\n<h3><span>RockShox Reverb AXS XPLR pricing</span></h3>\n<p><span>The Reverb AXS XPLR doesn’t come cheap at £500 / €600 / $600 – a considerable jump from our current favourite cable-operated 27.2mm dropper, the Crankbrothers Highline at £274.</span></p>\n<h2><span>SRAM expands its gravel reach</span></h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> XPLR drivetrain options are offered across

start to wonder why we need yet more options when it comes to gravel gearing.</span></p>\n<p><span>Well, SRAM thinks there’s more to be had from a wide-range 1x setup – one that increases the gearing range of the current road/gravel line-up, without extending to MTB levels.</span></p>\n<p><span>As a result, we’ve got the new XPLR crankset, cassette and </span><a

levels.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Gearing sweetspot</span></h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The XPLR 12-speed cassette has a 10-44t range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>The centrepiece of the XPLR drivetrain is the 10-44t cassette. </span></p>\n<p><span>SRAM says it has been testing gearing options with the engineering team and sponsored athletes for more than a year to try and nail down the ideal spread across such a broad cassette, and finally settled on a 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 24, 28, 32, 38, 44 combination. </span></p>\n<p><span>As you can see, the tooth jumps between gears compress as you run down the block into ‘harder’ gears. SRAM says the feedback they had from riders using a mullet setup was that the jump from 10 to 12 teeth at the bottom of the cassette was noticeable on flatter, fast sections. For comparison, a 10-50t Eagle cassette starts with 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 21 teeth, but for XPLR a tighter running order was preferred.</span></p>\n<p><span>SRAM still thinks the 10-50t cassette is a suitable mullet option for gravel riders looking to ride the toughest of trails, while the existing 10-36t cassette is well-suited for those looking for speed on the road and fast gravel. </span></p>\n<p><span>The new XPLR option is – no surprises here – designed to fill the gap. SRAM says the 10-44t option is aimed at both rough and road, with smoother gear progression – no big jumps at the top or bottom of the range. It’s a happy medium between the two extremes, according to SRAM.</span></p>\n<p><span>XPLR cassettes will be available in two options, both using SRAM’s mini-cluster design, whereby the first four sprockets are machined from a single steel billet with the remaining eight pinned together. </span></p>\n<p><span>The high-grade XG-1271 uses a lighter alloy at the top end and weighs a claimed 373g, while the XG-1251 comes in at a claimed 412g and is all-steel. </span></p>\n<h2><span>XPLR rear derailleur capacity extends to 44 teeth</span></h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The XPLR rear derailleur has capacity for 44 teeth, broadening SRAM’s range of 1x gearing options for gravel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Alongside the cassette, SRAM has also introduced a new XPLR rear mech design. Compared to the </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-12-speed-red-etap-axs-hrd-review/\"><span>standard AXS mechs</span></a><span>, which have a maximum capacity of 33 teeth, and the </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-red-etap-axs-max-36t-rear-derailleur/\"><span>Wide option</span></a><span>, with its 36-tooth maximum, the new mech ramps up the range to 44 teeth to match the XPLR cassette. </span></p>\n<p><span>The XPLR mech is 1x only. Its design differs from the standard AXS systems in that the upper pulley on the mech is offset, meaning it’ll only provide optimal chainline to a single chainring. The pulleys are also oversized compared to the standard AXS mechs.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>The XPLR derailleur is designed to work only with the flat-top chains from SRAM’s road AXS groupsets, so mixing it up with mountain bike SRAM Eagle chains isn’t an option. </span></p>\n<p><span>Like standard AXS, the XPLR rear mechs come with a chain management system.

The XPLR 101 is based around the single-wall carbon rim technology that debuted on the radical </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/zipp-3zero-moto-2021/\"><span>Zipp 3Zero Moto wheelset</span></a><span> and will come in both 700c and 650b sizes.</span></p>\n<p><span>The single-wall design features what Zipp calls ‘ankle compliance’, which allows the rim to rock on the spoke nipple. The result, Zipp claims, is a vibration-damping rim and compliance that reduces rider fatigue. </span></p>\n<p><span>While the Moto MTB rim has a huge 30mm internal width, the 101 reduces this down to a more manageable 27mm. According to ETRTO (European Tyre and Rim Technical Organisation) guidelines, that allows for a maximum tyre size of 65mm (2.5in), though we can’t think of many gravel bikes that’ll allow for that sort of volume (only Cairn’s monster truck-like Brave e-gravel bike springs to mind – we’ve a test coming soon). </span></p>\n<p><span>Externally, the rim is a broad 35mm wide and just 15mm deep, making these by far the shallowest 700c wheels Zipp has ever produced.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The single-wall construction is said to improve comfort.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zipp</i></span></div>\n<p><span>With the allowances for such big </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\"><span>gravel bike tyres</span></a><span>, the 101s will allow plenty of scope for experimenting with tyre size and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/road-bike-tyre-pressure/\">tyre pressure</a>.  </span></p>\n<p><span>The wheels can be used with Quarq’s clever Tyrewiz for Moto, which fits flat onto the rim surface, as opposed to the standard </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/maintenance/tools-kits-and-boxes/pressure-gauge/quarq-tyrewiz-tyre-pressure-monitor-review/\"><span>Quarq Tyrewiz</span></a><span>, which fits on the valve stem. Still, it’s not cheap at £304 / €269.</span></p>\n<p><span>The rims are built onto Zipp’s new ZR1 hub set, which impressed us on the new </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/zipp-303-firecrest-wheelset-review/\"><span>Zipp 303 Firecrest wheels</span></a><span> recently launched, thanks to the fast freehub with 66-point engagement. </span></p>\n<p><span>The new 101 wheelset weighs in at a claimed 1,665g for 700c and 1,590g for 650b. Compared to the flyweight of the new 303 Firecrest (1,352g) that doesn’t sound that impressive and plenty of gravel riders have already chosen the 303 as their go-to gravel option.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/SRAM-RockShox-XPLR-10-c97529c.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Zipp’s XPLR range already includes the G40 gravel tyres. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/08/SRAM-RockShox-XPLR-12-1cd0a37.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>There’s an XPLR handlebar from Zipp, too.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p><span>However, it’s worth noting the new 101 is actually lighter than the previous-generation 303 (1,678g a pair) and the 101’s rim technology is designed to offer increased comfort. </span></p>\n<p><span>It’s something we’ll put to the test, but due to global production and shipping delays, it’s the only element of the new XPLR range we haven’t managed to get our hands on at launch. Instead, our test rigs have come with 303 Firecrests. As soon as the new hoops land, we’ll be well placed to make a direct comparison and see if Zipp’s ‘ankle compliance’ really does live up to the claims.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Zipp 101 XPLR pricing</span><span> </span></h3>\n<p><span>The Zipp 101 XPLR is priced at £780 / $850 / €870 for the front wheel and £866 / $950 / €970 for the rear, so that’s £1,646 / $1,800 / €1,840 a pair in both 700c and 650b (compared to the 303 Firecrest at £1,600 pair).</span></p>\n<p><span> You can choose from either ‘Kwiqsand’ (sand) or standard Zipp graphics.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Coming soon</span></h2>\n<p><span>We’ve got two bikes built up with XPLR kit, one is with our mountain bike supremo Rob Weaver and the other with me (senior technical editor for road, Warren).
