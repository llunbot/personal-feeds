The company claims 99.75 percent of accounts weren't affected, but for some, that revelation doesn't eradicate feelings of \"disgust\" and concern.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/wyze-outage-leaves-customers-without-camera-coverage-overnight/\">Wyze claims that an outage</a> on Friday left customers unable to view camera footage for hours. Wyze has blamed the outage on a problem with an undisclosed Amazon Web Services (AWS) partner but hasn't provided details.</p>\n<p>Monday morning, Wyze sent <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/1auizlh/update_on_investigation_of_21624_security_issue/\">emails</a> out to customers, including those Wyze says weren't affected, informing them that the outage led to 13,000 people being able to access data from strangers' cameras, as reported by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/19/24077233/wyze-security-camera-breach-13000-customers-events\">The Verge</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004402#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004402&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"66e6b909641d0efa8ce69b70070074f626c0a4d161d59167241ee9114477d43a","category":"Tech"}
