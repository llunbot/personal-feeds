Winter is still here, and we’re still on the trainer. There is good news, though. After the latest update for Zwift, TrainerRoad users have a new way to work out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zwift already offers several structured workouts, but it doesn’t offer personalized training plans the way that TrainerRoad does. Now, you can ride those same training plans inside the immersive world of Zwift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you connect your TrainerRoad account to Zwift, your planned workouts will automatically appear on Zwift. You can also get recommended daily workouts from TrainerRoad on Zwift if you don’t have a current plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more details, <a href=\"https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/trainerroad-zwift-together-at-last/\" target=\"_blank\">check out the TrainerRoad page</a> and get after it!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>There’s still time to Zwift In Real Life</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/zwift_community_live_intro_1x1.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/zwift_community_live_intro_1x1-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Zwift Community Live\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/zwift_community_live_intro_1x1-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/zwift_community_live_intro_1x1-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/zwift_community_live_intro_1x1-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/zwift_community_live_intro_1x1-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/zwift_community_live_intro_1x1.webp 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the tail end of 2024, Zwift announced that they would be hosting their first-ever gathering of Zwifters in real life. Zwift Community Live is taking place April 3-6, 2025, and is expected to bring together riders from around the world to celebrate all things Zwfit. Guests will include Sir Chris Hoy, Matt Stephens, Kristin Armstrong, GP Llama, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better still, the event will take place at the Iberostar Playa de Muro Village resort in Mallorca, Spain. And even though it’s for Zwift, there will be plenty of riding in real life to sample the legendary roads of Mallorca. Group rides will take place from the 4th-6th, and will include options from the Pretzel (50-70km), the Mega Pretzel (80-95km), and the Uber Pretzel (110-120km) which delivers the full Mallorca experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still a few spots available, with package pricing starting at €1150. That breaks down to €385 for the event ticket, and Hotel accommodations start around €752 for the duration, and you’ll have to pay your way to get to Palma de Mallorca Airport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t want to travel with your bike, CUBE rental bikes will be provided by Huerzeler starting at €168.00 for 4-7 days, which represents a 20% discount for Zwift guests. <a href=\"https://www.huerzeler.com/en/diverses/zwift\" target=\"_blank\">Register here</a>, book those plane tickets, and Ride On!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Iberostar_Playa_de_Muro_Village_Hauptbild.webp\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Iberostar_Playa_de_Muro_Village_Hauptbild.webp\" alt=\"Zwift Community Live Iberostar resort\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Iberostar_Playa_de_Muro_Village_Hauptbild.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Iberostar_Playa_de_Muro_Village_Hauptbild-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Iberostar_Playa_de_Muro_Village_Hauptbild-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Iberostar_Playa_de_Muro_Village_Hauptbild-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>Iberostar Playa de Muro Village, exclusive to Zwifters for this event! </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h5>Hotel stay (April 3-7, 2025) – From €752</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Accommodation at the 5-star Iberostar Selection Playa de Muro Village is exclusively reserved for Zwift Community Live guests.
