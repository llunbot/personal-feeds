Orbea says their latest step forward on urban strategy is centered on three main pillars of Performance, Smart Design, and Personalization.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Orbea is no stranger to making high-performance bikes. They’ve taken that expertise and applied it to their new Urban bicycle. For example, using lightweight frames, and components, and tech that is specifically relevant to Urban mobility. This provides a greater focus on rider confidence, comfort, and appropriate power. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-side-e1709759285755.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"757\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-side-e1709759285755.jpeg\" alt=\"Orbea Diem front side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-side-e1709759285755.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-side-e1709759285755-297x176.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-side-e1709759285755-800x473.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-side-e1709759285755-120x71.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-side-e1709759285755-768x454.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Orbea)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-back-side-with-rack-e1709759264704.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"731\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-back-side-with-rack-e1709759264704.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-back-side-with-rack-e1709759264704.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-back-side-with-rack-e1709759264704-297x170.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-back-side-with-rack-e1709759264704-800x457.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-back-side-with-rack-e1709759264704-120x69.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-back-side-with-rack-e1709759264704-768x439.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Diem: The New A to B</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Riding from point A to point B should be fun, not something to dread. The Diem is not just a powerful tool for city riding, but a classy and trustworthy partner that you can count on every day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The quality components, attention to detail, and clever frame design give you the smoothest ride. The dynamic motor and precise handling make it a breeze to slot into traffic. The wraparound lights will keep you safe while jockeying through the urban jungle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s see what Orbea says about what sets the Diem apart from the others. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quality, a Step Above</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Diem is built with a deep understanding of performance, design, and a belief that riding should be enjoyable. The elegant frame design “removes anything superfluous”, while pursuing simple solutions. With high-quality components and accessories, the Diem is a collection of details that work together to “give a riding experience way beyond other city bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-close-up.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-close-up.jpeg\" alt=\"Orbea Diem close up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-close-up.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-close-up-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-close-up-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-close-up-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-close-up-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-close-up-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hydroformed, butted aluminum tubing gives Orbea more control over the material. This enhances the frame design while reducing weight and optimizing frame rigidity. A bike that has a nice balance of rigidity and weight makes for a fun riding bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final step of a “High Polish” finish, where the welds are “polished” to make them invisible, giving the Diem its smooth look. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-at-night.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-at-night.jpeg\" alt=\"Orbea Diem at night\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-at-night.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-at-night-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-at-night-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-at-night-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-at-night-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-at-night-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Diem’s intelligent lighting system will help keep you seen whether riding during the day or at night. The rear light gets brighter as you brake, alerting traffic behind you. The front light has an “auto-on” when the daytime light fades to night, allowing you to be seen, while illuminating the road ahead. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Performance, Enjoy Every Ride</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Orbea used their patented design called Diamond Glide when designing the Diem’s frame. This design allows the frame to be vertically compliant, absorbing bumps and smoothing out the rough, un-maintained roads. The combo of the carbon fork and wide tires lend to the overall smooth ride of the Diem.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-in-action.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-in-action.jpeg\" alt=\"Orbea Diem in action\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-in-action.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-in-action-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-in-action-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-in-action-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-in-action-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-in-action-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Diem uses Orbea’s new “Urban geometry” which keeps the weight low and centered. This, in turn, means fast reflexes and inherent stability, helping navigate the urban area.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Safety, Safety Built into Every Journey</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-headlight.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-headlight.jpeg\" alt=\"Orbea Diem integrated headlight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-headlight.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-headlight-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-headlight-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-headlight-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-headlight-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-headlight-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Every Diem will come with a built-in, high-tech lighting system that will automatically switch itself on to help keep you safe. The front beam will automatically come on at night, and the wrap-around lights make sure you are always visible day or night, even from the side. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-light.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-light.jpeg\" alt=\"Orbea Diem rear light\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-light.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-light-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-light-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-light-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-light-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-light-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, the rear brake light will get brighter when the rider is braking. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-Supernova-headlight.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-Supernova-headlight.jpeg\" alt=\"Orbea Diem integrated Supernova headlight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-Supernova-headlight.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-Supernova-headlight-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-Supernova-headlight-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-Supernova-headlight-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-Supernova-headlight-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-integrated-Supernova-headlight-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-rack-and-lights.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-rack-and-lights.jpeg\" alt=\"Orbea Diem front rack and lights\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-rack-and-lights.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-rack-and-lights-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-rack-and-lights-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-rack-and-lights-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-rack-and-lights-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-front-rack-and-lights-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Diem’s headlight is the Supernova Starstream and is integrated into the handlebar, or the front rack if that’s the option you choose. Integrating the light into the handlebar will help prevent damage, theft, and obstructions from the light beam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, this helps you stay visible. There is an option to pick the Supernova Starstream dual beam, allowing the rider to easily switch between low and high beams. All of the lights that come equipped on the Diem are StVZO compliant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping you load and unload the Diem easily is the integrated Spin Block system, which keeps the handlebars from rotating too far. All Diem models will come equipped with high-quality tires that are puncture-resistant and have reflective sidewall stripes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, hidden on the Diem’s motor cover is a spot to hide your AirTag if you see fit. It doesn’t have to be an Airtag, it can be any compatible tracker. the Diem also comes equipped with a lifetime warranty.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Full Power, Intelligent Control</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Diem is equipped with a 630Wh battery, integrated into the downtube, and uses the “latest cell technology” packing more charge into a smaller space. This equates to around 150 km, or 9 hours, between charges, which could mean that many riders may need to charge their bike less than once a week. A typical charge takes around 4 hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-Shimano-and-Gates-belt-drive.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-Shimano-and-Gates-belt-drive.jpeg\" alt=\"Orbea Diem Shimano and Gates belt drive\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-Shimano-and-Gates-belt-drive.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-Shimano-and-Gates-belt-drive-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-Shimano-and-Gates-belt-drive-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-Shimano-and-Gates-belt-drive-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-Shimano-and-Gates-belt-drive-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-Shimano-and-Gates-belt-drive-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Shimano EP motor offers simple, reliable service day after day, as well as an extensive network of service centers if needed. The rider can control the subtle LED backlit remote without moving their hands from the bars. For more info, the rider can easily connect to the mobile app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SBS system securely fixes the battery inside the bike frame. This not only makes the battery impossible to steal, SBS allows Orbea to design better-looking, slimmer frames that are lighter and stiffer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a 252Wh range extender that slots easily into the bottle cage, making it easy to remove it and take it up to the office to top it off. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Everything You Need, and Nothing You Don’t </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 20kg and 30kg rear carriers available for the Diem. Both of these carriers are compatible with Ortlieb and MIK systems along with an optional 10kg front rack and basket.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-rack.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-rack.jpeg\" alt=\"Orbea Diem rear rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-rack.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-rack-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-rack-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-rack-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-rack-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-rear-rack-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also an available adaptor that makes the Diem 10 and Diem 20 compatible with Thule, Burley, Croozer, and Hamax trailers. Diem 30 works with conventional thru axle adaptors. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-clever-integrated-kick-stand.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-clever-integrated-kick-stand.jpeg\" alt=\"Orbea Diem clever integrated kick stand\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-clever-integrated-kick-stand.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-clever-integrated-kick-stand-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-clever-integrated-kick-stand-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-clever-integrated-kick-stand-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-clever-integrated-kick-stand-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-clever-integrated-kick-stand-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The lower step-through frame makes it easy to mount and dismount. It could even add security when the need for a sudden stop occurs. The integrated kickstand pivots from the bike’s center, and neatly “hides” when not in use. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-intgrated-phone-mount.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-intgrated-phone-mount.jpeg\" alt=\"Orbea Diem intgrated phone mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-intgrated-phone-mount.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-intgrated-phone-mount-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-intgrated-phone-mount-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-intgrated-phone-mount-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-intgrated-phone-mount-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Orbea-Diem-intgrated-phone-mount-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrated cables and switches in the handlebar mean that everything you need is at your fingertips, keeping your hands on the bars.
