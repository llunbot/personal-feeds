Every time they hit the brakes on their Jeep, they <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/1iij34r/jeep_puts_an_ad_covering_my_entire_screen_and_it/\">wrote</a>, a promotion for an extended warranty plan popped up in the center console. “Press the ‘call’ button to speak to a specialist,” they say the ad encouraged, welcoming the user to use their Bluetooth connection to complete the upsell then and there.</p>\n<p>Ads are annoying and occasionally insidious; an ad that repeatedly appears inside one’s own car more so.

He acknowledged, though, that Stellantis shows other drivers in-vehicle promotions too. Dodge owners, for example, get an infotainment push after 60 days of purchase offering the Dodge Complete Performance Package, a comprehensive warranty offering. Stellantis says that, on average, customers receive about two in-vehicle messages annually, containing safety, maintenance, or marketing information.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/in-car-advertising-glitch-may-be-preview-of-a-distracting-future/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/in-car-advertising-glitch-may-be-preview-of-a-distracting-future/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Aarian Marshall, wired.com","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1f86b56f4c5ad2b3c073d3198f2b6c20492b1f3d20b260a51ba1e4b050f97a59","category":"Tech"}
