For those who frequent the dirt jumps, skateparks or pumptracks, Revel Bikes is re-releasing their Tweedy dirt jumper as both a complete bike and a frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revel named the Tweedy after their team rider Brady Tweedy, who helped with the development of the bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“This bike represents our passion for creating a product simply for the joy of making something excellent that we all wanted. The fact that it’s a pro model for Brady is even more special. He’s one of the kindest people I know, hilarious, and can ride a bike like no other. I’m honoured to have him representing Revel” –</em> Adam Miller, Founder.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Revel Bikes Tweedy – Frame Details:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-frame.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"571\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-frame.jpg\" alt=\"Revel Tweedy dirt jumper, frame, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-frame.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-frame-297x141.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-frame-800x381.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-frame-120x57.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-frame-768x365.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tweedy is built from steel, but not just any steel: The frames are made using durable, high-quality Reynolds 853 double-butted tubing sourced from the UK. They are built in Taiwan at what Revel calls one of the best artisan steel bike manufacturing facilities – that just happens to be in Taiwan. The Tweedy was designed around 26” wheels and a 100mm fork. The frame is pretty lean and simple, but Revel uses a gusset at the head tube/down tube junction and a slim chainstay yoke to keep it good and strong.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-BB-yoke.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-BB-yoke.jpg\" alt=\"Revel Tweedy dirt jumper, BB, chainstay yoke\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-BB-yoke.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-BB-yoke-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-BB-yoke-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-BB-yoke-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-BB-yoke-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tweedy frame features a threaded BB shell, and horizontal dropouts for a bolt-on rear axle. Revel has included an integrated seat clamp and the frame runs an integrated headset. Seat post diameter is 27.2mm. With just one brake hose to corral, they’ve kept the routing external for easy maintenance. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-graphics.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-graphics.jpg\" alt=\"Revel Tweedy dirt jumper, graphics\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-graphics.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-graphics-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-graphics-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-graphics-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-graphics-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Revel-Tweedy-DJ-graphics-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Revel has introduced a new limited edition ‘Johnny Green Jeans’ color to celebrate the Tweedy’s re-release (which looks to have a nice metallic flake in it). The Tweedy is available in it’s original raw color as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the new paint job Revel kept the bike’s aesthetic simple with an engraved head tube logo, the brand name, the model name and a sticker to advertise its Reynolds tubing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tweedy is available in one frame size.
