The score is based on your exercise history, sleep, and heart rate, and is used to recommend what exercise routine you should undertake each day.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Fitbit Charge 5<br />179 USD<a href=\"https://t.co/6bhJFPBI6x\">https://t.co/6bhJFPBI6x</a></p>— Snoopy (@_snoopytech_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_snoopytech_/status/1429512996510912516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 22, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nEvery device purchased comes with a six-month trial of Fitbit Premium, which is clearly competing with Apple Watch and its Apple Fitness+ integration, with guided workouts and programs on offer on top of sleep tools and other health insights.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Fitbit Charge will be available in at least three colors, and there's no word on the specific release date for the fitness tracker-cum-smartwatch, but Google is likely to place it strategically around the launch of the Apple Watch Series 7 that's expected to be announced in the next month or so.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fitbit/\">Fitbit</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/24/fitbit-charge-5-tracker-leaked-video/\">Fitbit Charge 5 Tracker Design and Features Leaked in New Video</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fitbit-charge-5-tracker-design-and-features-leaked-in-new-video.2308492/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kfRE8FFw6GI:7h-G76x0Va8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kfRE8FFw6GI:7h-G76x0Va8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/kfRE8FFw6GI\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5c4c84385315c078bb2c9c802f88ad42381655496bdb09598b0af759703a3c58","category":"Apple"}
