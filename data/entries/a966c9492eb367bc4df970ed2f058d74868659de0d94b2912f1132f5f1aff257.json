I’m \nconvinced the answer is no — that (a) there will never be an \niPhone with a built-in hardware keyboard; and (b) Apple will not \nsuffer for it. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Are software touchscreen keyboards good for everyone? Certainly \nnot. But this is another aspect of the Apple Way. Apple tries to \nmake things that many people love, not things that all people \nlike. The key is that they’re not afraid of the staunch criticism, \nand often outright derision, that comes with breaking conventions. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Holds up. In 2023 it seems wild that Apple’s all-in bet on touchscreen keyboards for iPhones was controversial at all, let alone the subject of vociferous debate for years.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/04/mobile-phone-keyboards-2009\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a966c9492eb367bc4df970ed2f058d74868659de0d94b2912f1132f5f1aff257","category":"Tech"}
