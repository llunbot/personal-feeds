Well, if you need a handful of AirTags right now, you can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542LL-A-AirTag-Pack/dp/B0D54JZTHY/\">get a four-pack for $73 at Amazon</a>, a savings of $43 off Apple’s $29 price for a single AirTag or just $18.25 per tracker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tiny devices look great, and they’re super easy to set up with your iPhone or iPad. Once they’re connected to your devices, you can easily use the Find My app to pinpoint their exact location. During those hectic mornings when you can’t find your keys, you can just launch the app on your phone and make the AirTag play a sound so they’re easier to locate, cutting down minutes of panic searching the house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when the AirTag is out of range, the device will simply ping off of nearby Apple devices, helping you locate it as precisely as possible. If you lose something with an AirTag, you can just set it to Lost Mode from the app, and anyone who finds it can contact you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346345/apple-airtag-review.html\">our review of the AirTag</a>, we appreciated the small design, the fact that it has a removable battery, and its tremendous versatility with the Find My network.
