{"title":"Getting Your `head` Straight: A New CSS Performance Diagnostics Snippet","link":"https://smashingmagazine.com/2021/09/css-head-tag/","date":1632322800000,"content":"<p>There are plenty of ways to <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/01/smashingmag-performance-case-study/\">detect performance bottlenecks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/css-auditing-tools/\">audit CSS</a>. We can look into common performance bottlenecks and the complexity of stylesheets, the way we load assets, and the order in which it happens. </p>\n<p>One helpful way to spot common problems easily is to use some sort of a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/tkadlec/683b26344cde774170b94c0fcf0088b4\">performance diagnostics CSS</a> — a dedicated stylesheet that highlights potential problems and errors.</p>\n<p>Today, during his talk at Webexpo Prague 2021, <a href=\"https://csswizardry.com/\">Harry Roberts</a>, a web performance consultant and front-end engineer, introduced a little helper that helps him spot common performance bottlenecks easily. And that is mostly related to the order of how assets are loaded in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>As Harry says,</p>\n<blockquote>“I spend a lot of my time looking through clients’ <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags to ensure everything in there is in the best possible shape it can be. There are a lot of complex and often conflicting rules that constitute ‘good’ <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags, and cross-referencing everything can soon grow unwieldy, so to make my life easier, I developed <a href=\"https://csswizardry.com/ct/\">ct.css</a> — a quick and dirty way of seeing inside of your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.”</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://csswizardry.com/ct/\"><code>ct.css</code></a> is a little diagnostic snippet, named after Computed Tomography (CT) scans, that exposes potential performance issues in your page’s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags, and will disappear as soon as you’ve fixed them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b713dab1-412a-4a4c-883c-a3fb06c2a8df/head-article-1.png\" /></p>\n<p>Harry has put all the insights he’s learned from his performance work to a perfect <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> order, and the tool exposes some of the issues that often result from a suboptimal arrangement of <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b5bbafda-ded4-4bd3-bb2a-8c4188693d30/head-2.png\" /></p>\n<p>With the bookmarklet in the browser’s toolbar, browse to a website of your choice, click or activate the bookmarklet, and the tool <strong>highlights useful pointers</strong> for you to double-check when working around performance bottlenecks. Just a little helper to make your work a bit easier, and find all those hidden issues faster.</p>\n<p>If you just want to play with the snippet, you can get it at <a href=\"https://csswizardry.com/ct/\">csswizardry.com/ct</a>.
