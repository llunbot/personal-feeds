As the primary handling interface of your bike, your handlebar is critical not only for control but can have a significant impact on your comfort as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While mountain bike handlebars all look relatively similar, there are some pretty significant differences among the myriad options on the market. Working with modern materials and construction methods, brands have been able to design handlebars with different performance characteristics to suit just about every need and preference, and that’s a great thing. It turns out that the handlebar is, in fact, a performance component that can provide varying benefits, whether you’re seeking something stiff and precise, compliant and forgiving, or if you’re trying to lighten up your ride or dial in the fit of your cockpit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, there are so many different mountain bike handlebars on the market it could make your head spin. Made from materials ranging from carbon fiber to aluminum – even titanium, coming in 31.8mm and 35mm clamp sizes, and a whole range of different rise and sweep options, it can be hard to figure out which is the best handlebar for you. It doesn’t help that every handlebar is claimed to be the best for (insert adjective here) by their respective manufacturers. So how do you choose the right one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, we <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/does-handlebar-compliance-make-a-difference-faction-bike-studio-blind-test/\" target=\"_blank\">teamed up with Faction Bike Studio to do a first-of-its-kind group compliance test of 42 different handlebars</a> in their lab, followed by rider testing to see how those findings translated to use out on the trail. Armed with the information gathered during lab and rider testing, along with months of testing the bars included here in the real world, we’ve got recommendations to suit every need and budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our favorite mountain bike handlebars are listed below, along with the best of the rest which are also great options worthy of serious consideration.

Components Carbon</a> is one of the most popular aftermarket handlebars on the market because it beautifully manages to balance the seemingly disparate characteristics of low weight, comfort, and responsive handling. It’s rare when we can’t find any fault with a product, but we feel there is literally nothing wrong with the OneUp Carbon handlebar. </p><p></p><p>OneUp has hung their hat on the patented oval design which is clearly visible in the taper/rise section of the Carbon handlebar. This ovalized section allows the handlebar to flex slightly for vertical compliance but remains stiff horizontally for precise steering control. If that sounds like marketing lingo, well, it is, but this handlebar works exactly as advertised out on the trail. The compliance takes the edge off larger impacts while the carbon construction helps to dampen the buzz of high-frequency vibrations to keep your hands feeling fresher for longer. Faction’s lab testing backs this up as well, with the OneUp Carbon (20mm rise) falling just below the average in terms of compliance.</p><p></p><p>Our editors have been riding OneUp carbon bars for several years and have always been pleased by the balanced ride quality and comfort they provide. In addition to the compliance and vibration-absorbing properties mentioned above, they have a crowd-pleasing shape with a neutral 8° back sweep and 5° upsweep. They only come in a 35mm clamp diameter, but they come in both 20mm and 35mm rise options so you can dial in the fit of your cockpit to suit most people’s needs. The 800mm width is plenty wide without being too wide, and we expect many riders will likely be trimming them down anyway, and they can be cut as narrow as 750mm if needed. </p><p></p><p>At just 228 grams (20mm rise), the OneUp carbon is competitively lightweight. There are lighter options for XC bikes, but it’s impressive for a bar made for aggressive trail, enduro, and gravity riding. It also looks pretty darn good with a matte black finish and super subtle gloss black logos, plus you can get decals ($7) in a huge range of colors to match other parts or show a touch of flair. OneUp also sells bundles at a slight discount where you can get the bar, stem, grips, and decals to replace your whole cockpit at once.</p><p></p><p>We’ve tested a lot of different bars over the years and for this review, and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F166238%2Foneup-components-carbon-handlebar\">OneUp Components Carbon</a> is one that we keep going back to. We absolutely love it and at $160, it’s reasonably priced for carbon. And, if you’re not willing to spend that much, they also make an Aluminum version that we think is one of the best options if you’re operating on a tighter budget.</p><p></p><p>You can find out more in our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-oneup-components-carbon-handlebar/\">full review of the OneUp Components Carbon Handlebar</a>.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F166238%2Foneup-components-carbon-handlebar\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RB7RHLV/?tag=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Value Carbon Mountain Bike Handlebar\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F221930%2Ffsa-gradient-carbon-riser-30-handlebar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFSA Gradient Carbon Riser 30\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$146</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Carbon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>237g (31.8mm clamp, 30mm rise)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>800mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Clamp Diameter</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>31.8mm (35mm also available)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rise Options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>20mm, 30mm (tested)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Sweep</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>8° back, 5° up</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FSA-Gradient-Carbon-Riser.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1001\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FSA-Gradient-Carbon-Riser.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Handlebars of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FSA-Gradient-Carbon-Riser.jpeg 1001w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FSA-Gradient-Carbon-Riser-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FSA-Gradient-Carbon-Riser-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FSA-Gradient-Carbon-Riser-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FSA-Gradient-Carbon-Riser-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FSA-Gradient-Carbon-Riser-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Reasonably priced for carbon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightweight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Great middle-of-the road compliance (other sizes are much stiffer)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Available in both clamp diameters</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Pretty loud branding</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Other sizes tested much stiffer</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Full Speed Ahead (FSA) makes a surprisingly large range of products for all types of cycling including road, gravel, and mountain biking. They’ve got a full line of mountain bike handlebars in both carbon and aluminum, with the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F221930%2Ffsa-gradient-carbon-riser-30-handlebar\">Gradient Carbon</a> models representing the top of their line of Trail/Enduro bars. </p><p></p><p>In the Faction Bike Studio test lab, we measured the compliance of four FSA Gradient Carbon bars which represent both both rise options (20mm and 30mm) in both clamp diameters. In the lab, 3 of those were in the top ten stiffest of the 42 bars measured, and the two 35mm clamp options were in the top 5. The 31.8mm models were notably less stiff, particularly the 30mm rise version that we’re including here. In fact, it falls right around the average in terms of stiffness/compliance compared to the rest of the group. On the trail, that compliance is certainly noticeable, as is this bar’s ability to filter out vibration for a nice, damp feel, though it’s certainly not lacking in responsiveness either. </p><p></p><p>FSA gave the Gradient Carbon bars a somewhat unique appearance with the rise/taper section being ovalized, but in the opposite way of the OneUp handlebars. While it seems somewhat counterintuitive, it provides a ride feel that we got along with well, at least in the 31.8mm clamp, 30mm rise version. Again, the other sizes tested quite a bit stiffer. The 8° back sweep and 5° upsweep should suit most riders just fine, as should the 800mm width that can be trimmed to suit your preference. Our test bar weighed in at 237 grams at its full width, which is competitive with similar models.</p><p></p><p>With a raw carbon finish and loud but relatively tasteful silver logos, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F221930%2Ffsa-gradient-carbon-riser-30-handlebar\">Gradient Carbon</a> are nice-looking handlebars. And at $146, they undercut the price of even the other reasonably priced carbon options on the market by just a bit. So, if you’re looking for an affordable carbon handlebar, the FSA Gradient is a good option to consider, and we were especially fond of the balanced feel of the 31.8mm clamp, 30mm rise version.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F221930%2Ffsa-gradient-carbon-riser-30-handlebar\">Check Price at REI</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T9GDDD6/?tag=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Overall Aluminum Mountain Bike Handlebar\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Foneup-components-alloy-handlebar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOneUp Components Aluminum Handlebar\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$90</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Aluminum</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>342g (35mm rise)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>800mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Clamp Diameter</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>35mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rise Options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>20mm, 35mm (tested)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Sweep</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>8° back, 5° up</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OneUp-Components-Aluminum-Handlebar.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1272\" height=\"848\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OneUp-Components-Aluminum-Handlebar.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Handlebars of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OneUp-Components-Aluminum-Handlebar.jpeg 1272w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OneUp-Components-Aluminum-Handlebar-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OneUp-Components-Aluminum-Handlebar-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OneUp-Components-Aluminum-Handlebar-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OneUp-Components-Aluminum-Handlebar-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/OneUp-Components-Aluminum-Handlebar-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Slightly more compliant than the carbon version</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Less expensive than carbon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Sold in bundles with stem, grips, and decals</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Heavier weight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Doesn't mute vibration as well as the carbon version</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Building off the success of their popular Carbon handlebar, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Foneup-components-alloy-handlebar\">OneUp Components Aluminum</a> was launched last year with the goal of providing the same performance in a less expensive aluminum version. One of the biggest challenges was creating the same unique ovalized design in aluminum, but OneUp managed to pull it off, and in doing so, created “my favorite aluminum handlebar ever” according to <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/editors-choice-tylers-top-picks-from-2023/\">Tyler’s 2023 Editor’s Choice Award list</a>.</p><p></p><p>Just like the carbon version, the unique, patented oval shape in the taper/rise section of the bar allows for more vertical compliance while remaining horizontally stiff for steering control. The result is a bar that is more forgiving on the hands and wrists, especially on larger impacts, and that ride feel is backed up by Faction Bike Studio’s lab testing that showed the Aluminum version was even slightly more compliant than the carbon versions. It doesn’t feel quite as damp as the carbon versions, however, but it has one of the most balanced and comfortable feels of any aluminum bar we’ve ever tried. </p><p></p><p>The OneUp Aluminum handlebar comes in a 35mm clamp size, your choice of 20mm or 35mm rise, and a standard 800mm width that can be trimmed down to as narrow as 750mm if you need. The 8° back sweep and 5° upsweep hit a sweet spot that should be comfortable for most users. It’s made from 7050 – T76 Aluminum with a shot-peened finish for durability and a black anodized finish with gloss black logos. OneUp also sells decal kits ($7) in a range of colors if you like to customize or match them with other components. </p><p></p><p>If you don’t trust carbon fiber or simply want a similar performance to the OneUp Carbon handlebar at a more wallet-friendly price point, then the $90 <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Foneup-components-alloy-handlebar\">OneUp Components Aluminum</a> handlebar should be on your shortlist. This handlebar combines the best attributes of the carbon version with the durability and lower price of aluminum, and we think it’s the best option for under $100.</p><p></p><p>You can learn more

the affordable <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fhandlebars%2Fpnw-components-range-35-handlebar-v3%23image%3D221902%2F901807%2Fpnw-components-range-35-handlebar-v3\">Range Gen 3</a>. Now onto its third generation, the aluminum Range handlebar has seen incremental changes over the years to make it better than ever. PNW chose 2014 Aluminum for the Range Gen 3, as they claim it “most closely resembles carbon’s chatter absorbing qualities.”</p><p></p><p>Not everyone is willing or able to spend upwards of $150 on a handlebar, and that’s where the PNW Range comes in. PNW Components is known for making reasonably priced components that work well, like their Loam dropper post, and the Range Gen 3 will still be a significant upgrade over most stock aluminum bars, assuming the 30mm rise works for you.</p><p></p><p>The Range Gen 3 comes in both 35mm and 31.8mm clamp sizes, both of which proved to be relatively compliant in our lab testing. However, the 31.8mm size proved to be much more forgiving. We spent more time test-riding the 35mm clamp size, and despite being slightly stiffer, it provides a comfortable and balanced feel, where steering feels precise and the bar takes some of the sting out of larger impacts. While these bars are quite comfortable and absorb some vibration, it isn’t quite on the level of some of the more expensive carbon competitors.</p><p></p><p>The Range comes in an 800mm width, which is quite normal, although our test bar measured about 5mm wider than that. Not a deal breaker since most people will be trimming them anyway, and on that note, PNW says they can be trimmed down to 740mm if needed. With 5° of upsweep and 10° of back sweep, the PNW Range has a bit more relaxed geometry than some other bars. The 10° back sweep in particular lends itself to more of an upright body position which is common on a lot of today’s long and slack bikes. The 30mm is the only option offered, which will likely work well for a lot of people, but may be a limiting factor for others. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fhandlebars%2Fpnw-components-range-35-handlebar-v3%23image%3D221902%2F901807%2Fpnw-components-range-35-handlebar-v3\">PNW Range Gen 3</a> is a good-looking handlebar that provides comfort and predictable handling in an affordable aluminum package.

The <a href=\"https://roostbike.com/product/roost-handle-bars/\">Roost Titanium Riser</a> handlebar is a unique offering from the brand that aims to bring a high level of compliance to the table through the properties of the material which is known to provide a forgiving ride feel to frames while being super durable and great-looking. </p><p></p><p>In its quest to make a compliant handlebar, Roost has definitely succeeded, and all three rise options of the Titanium bars we tested were the most compliant in the Faction Bike Studio Lab. On average, the Titanium bars were approximately 30% more compliant than the bars tested made from aluminum or carbon fiber. That’s pretty significant, and that compliance definitely translates to use on the trail. In fact, you can even see a small amount of flex in the bars when you press on them in the ol’ parking lot test. On the trail, this compliance is quite noticeable, particularly when riding them back to back with stiffer bars. They soak up larger hits and impacts much more readily, and they do, in fact, provide an overall higher level of comfort. </p><p></p><p>All that compliance presented initially as a feeling of a slight reduction in handling precision, although, again, this was most noticeable when compared back to back with stiffer bars. It doesn’t take long at all to get totally used to the feel and they go unnoticed while riding, other than the increase in comfort, that is. Subsequent testing for several weeks showed that these handlebars simply feel great, and help reduce arm pump and fatigue, comparatively speaking. </p><p></p><p>While the Roost Titanium bars are lighter than most aluminum bars, at 303g (30mm rise), they are a bit heavier than most carbon options. For purposes that Roost claims are related to the construction of handlebars made from Titanium, they are only available in a 31.8mm clamp diameter. Roost offers three rise options, flat, 20mm, and 30mm, so you can choose the rise that works best for your needs. The 9° backsweep and 5° upsweep are pleasantly neutral and should work well for <em>most</em> riders.</p><p></p><p>The raw titanium finish and subtle matte logos of the <a href=\"https://roostbike.com/product/roost-handle-bars/\">Roost Titanium</a> bars are undeniably classy, and Roost claims that any scratches can be cleaned up with a Scotch-Brite pad to keep them looking fresh for years. This is a good thing as Titanium is known for its impressive durability, which will make the high asking price of $295 a little easier to justify. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://roostbike.com/product/roost-handle-bars/\">Check Price at Roost Bike</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Mountain Bike Handlebar for XC Riding and Racing\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FRace-Face-Next-SL-35-Handlebar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRace Face Next SL Carbon\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$180</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Carbon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>167g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>740mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Clamp Diameter</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>35mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rise Options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>10mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Sweep</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>8° back, 5° back</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Race-Face-Next-SL-Carbon.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"2280\" height=\"1520\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Race-Face-Next-SL-Carbon.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Handlebars of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Race-Face-Next-SL-Carbon.jpeg 2280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Race-Face-Next-SL-Carbon-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Race-Face-Next-SL-Carbon-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Race-Face-Next-SL-Carbon-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Race-Face-Next-SL-Carbon-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Race-Face-Next-SL-Carbon-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Race-Face-Next-SL-Carbon-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Race-Face-Next-SL-Carbon-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Super light</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Stiff and precise</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Surprisingly forgiving on the hands</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Perfect size and weight for XC bikes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>740mm width may be too narrow for some riders</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>If low weight is a priority and you’re looking for an upgrade for your lightweight trail, down-country, or XC race bike, the <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FRace-Face-Next-SL-35-Handlebar\">Race Face Next SL</a> is a great option to consider. Coming in at a mere 167 grams in an XC-appropriate 740mm width, this handlebar is a great way to finish off the cockpit on your custom build with a surprisingly well-balanced performance that provides both forgiveness and responsive handling.</p><p></p><p>Creating a balanced ride feel while making a handlebar as light as possible isn’t an easy task, but Race Face was up to the challenge. Surprisingly, they went with a 35mm clamp diameter, but it works well and allows them to lay up the carbon in such a way that it provides compliance vertically while remaining adequately stiff horizontally for responsive handling. While we were initially skeptical of their claims, it was quite impressive how comfortable our hands and wrists stayed while testing this bar, especially on short-travel XC bikes with stiff carbon rims. </p><p></p><p>The 740mm width of the Next SL handlebar might sound pretty narrow, and it is narrower than most bars these days, but it’s actually a really sensible width for its intended use. Most serious XC riders don’t typically use handlebars that are much wider, and often they trim them even narrower depending on their preference. Starting at 740mm, this allowed Race Face to tune the bar’s stiffness/compliance for that width, rather than something wider that then gets trimmed down. Race Face claims the Next SL can be trimmed as narrow as 690mm, and that the flex characteristics remain the same in that range. And, if you like the sound of this bar but want something slightly wider, the Next (non-SL) carbon bar comes in a 760mm width and is claimed to weigh just 13 grams more. </p><p></p><p>Of course, this handlebar isn’t meant for gravity riding, and as such, it only comes in a 10mm rise and it has a weight limit of 266 lbs. That said, we’ve been thrashing on one of these bars on an unreleased test bike for weeks, and it certainly doesn’t feel fragile. Instead, it adds a bit of calm and dampness to what is otherwise a very sharp-feeling bike. So, if you’re looking for something lightweight that avoids feeling overly harsh, the <a

href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07447DW9H/?tag=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar-20\">SQlab 30X Carbon</a> could be the answer you’re looking for. Coming from the ergonomics experts at SQlab, the 30X handlebar is available with either 12° or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0744BSQL2/?tag=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar-20\">16° of back sweep</a> which could provide better wrist alignment for those who need it. Yes, these bars are quite expensive, but SQlab also makes them in an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073P8WF6T/?tag=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar-20\">aluminum version</a> that costs about $200 less.</p><p></p><p>While most handlebars fall into the 8° to 9° back sweep range, that doesn’t mean it works for everyone. The folks at SQlab recognize that, so they, along with a few other brands, offer something different for those whose wrists could benefit from greater back sweep. Even for folks who get along generally fine with more standard back sweep measurements, like me, testing the 12° version of the 30X proved to be surprisingly comfortable. The first ten minutes or so felt a little different, but after that, the handlebar simply faded into the background and didn’t present any discomfort or handling issues.</p><p></p><p>SQlab only makes the 30X carbon in a 31.8mm clamp diameter, but the bar is quite stiff and responsive to handling input. It isn’t the <em>most compliant</em> handlebar around, but the carbon construction does a good job of muting some vibration and it doesn’t feel particularly harsh. Three rise options are offered, 15mm, 30mm, and 45mm, to suit varying needs, but it should be noted that the 45mm rise looks and feels a lot more like a 30mm rise from other brands.  </p><p></p><p>Other than the more pronounced back sweep, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07447DW9H/?tag=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar-20\">SQlab 30X Carbon</a> looks just like any other handlebar with a matte carbon finish and subtle black logos. At $320, however, it’s pretty hard to look past the high asking price. But, if you’ve struggled to get comfortable with other handlebars, this may be the answer you’ve been looking for. And, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073P8WF6T/?tag=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar-20\">30X Aluminum</a> version is a much lower-priced alternative if you’re looking to experiment.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07447DW9H/?tag=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best of the Rest</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tAn Excellent Premium Mountain Bike Handlebar\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/products/controls/handlebars/carbon-handlebar/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHope Carbon Handlebar\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$215</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Carbon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>222g (31.8mm clamp)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>800mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Clamp Diameter</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>31.8mm (35mm also available)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rise Options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>20mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Sweep</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>7° back, 5° up</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Hope-Carbon-Handlebar.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"838\" height=\"559\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Hope-Carbon-Handlebar.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Handlebars of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Hope-Carbon-Handlebar.jpeg 838w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Hope-Carbon-Handlebar-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Hope-Carbon-Handlebar-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Hope-Carbon-Handlebar-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Hope-Carbon-Handlebar-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Hope-Carbon-Handlebar-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightweight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Compliant and damp feeling (in 31.8mm clamp size)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Raw carbon finish looks awesome</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>7-degree back sweep is less than most</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>More difficult to find for sale</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Hope is well known for making exquisite products like hubs, brakes, cranks, frames, pedals, and more, so it’s no surprise that the <a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/products/controls/handlebars/carbon-handlebar/\">Hope Carbon Handlebar</a> is a top-notch component made with the quality and attention to detail that we’ve come to expect from the brand. It also happens to be unique looking, both in its raw carbon weave finish and the small lumps at the top of the rise/taper section, plus it’s made in the UK. </p><p></p><p>Hope makes the Carbon Handlebar in just one rise option, 20mm, but it comes in both 31.8mm and 35mm clamp sizes. This is one carbon handlebar that showed a significant amount of variability in its compliance in the Faction Bike Studio lab testing between the two clamp sizes. And while we’ve seen other reviews that claim the 35mm is more compliant, the test results say otherwise. For comparison, the 31.8mm clamp size had a below-average stiffness rating of 355 lbs/in, whereas the 35mm version measured above average at 436 lbs/in. So, depending on your preference, you could get a stiffer or more compliant version depending on the clamp size. We found that we preferred the 31.8mm clamp size as it provided more forgiveness in its ability to absorb larger impacts and vibration, quite similar to the OneUp Carbon described above.</p><p></p><p>The Hope Carbon bar comes in an 800mm width, and riders can trim them down as narrow as 760mm. Hope included guide marks for trimming the bars, as well as handy marks further inboard to facilitate the setup of your controls. It’s also impressively lightweight, tipping the scales at just 222 grams in the 31.8mm clamp size. The only minor quibble we have with this bar is that it comes with a <em>slightly more aggressive</em> 7° back sweep that lends itself best to more aggressive body positions. That said, that fits its intended use of aggressive trail and all-mountain riding where you’re often in the attack position. </p><p></p><p>At $215, the <a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/products/controls/handlebars/carbon-handlebar/\">Hope Carbon Handlebar</a> comes with a premium price tag, even when compared to most other carbon handlebars, but it’s undoubtedly a premium product too. If you’re a fan of Hope products, like the look of the raw carbon weave, or are simply looking for a lightweight carbon handlebar with nicely balanced vibration damping and handling precision, the Hope Carbon Handlebar won’t disappoint. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/products/controls/handlebars/carbon-handlebar/\">Check Price at Hope</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tStiff and Precise\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://nukeproof.com/products/horizon-v2-carbon-riser-bar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNukeproof Horizon V2 Carbon\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$150</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Carbon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>258g (25mm)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>800mm (780mm also available)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Clamp Diameter</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>35mm (31.8mm also available)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rise Options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>12mm, 25mm (tested), 38mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Sweep</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>9° back, 5° up</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Nukeproof-Horizon-V2-Carbon-Riser-Bar.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1256\" height=\"837\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Nukeproof-Horizon-V2-Carbon-Riser-Bar.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Handlebars of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Nukeproof-Horizon-V2-Carbon-Riser-Bar.jpeg 1256w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Nukeproof-Horizon-V2-Carbon-Riser-Bar-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Nukeproof-Horizon-V2-Carbon-Riser-Bar-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Nukeproof-Horizon-V2-Carbon-Riser-Bar-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Nukeproof-Horizon-V2-Carbon-Riser-Bar-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Nukeproof-Horizon-V2-Carbon-Riser-Bar-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Fair price for carbon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Stiff and precise</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Available in both clamp diameters and 2 widths</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Three rise options</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>A little heavier than other carbon options</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Less forgiving than other carbon models tested</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Given Nukeproof’s strong bias towards the aggressive side of the mountain biking spectrum, it doesn’t come as too much of a surprise that their<a href=\"https://nukeproof.com/products/horizon-v2-carbon-riser-bar\"> Horizon V2 Carbon</a> handlebars are some of the most stout and burly on the market. In fact, 4 Nukeproof Horizon V2 models were in the top ten stiffest of the 42 models we tested in the Faction Bike Studio test lab. So, if you prioritize precise handling and responsiveness above all else, this is one of our top recommendations. </p><p></p><p>Carbon fiber is a great material for handlebars because it can be manipulated and laid up in ways to get desired performance characteristics. While many brands are going out of their way to make their bars more compliant and forgiving, it doesn’t seem like Nukeproof is going that direction with the Horizon V2 bars. In fact, these bars are unyieldingly stiff, meaning that they respond instantly to every bit of your handling input. While the carbon construction does absorb a tiny bit of buzzy feedback, the rest is up to your arm strength and suspension setup. And, for some riders, that may be exactly what they’re looking for. </p><p></p><p>That said, if you take a look at the stiffness graph in our buying advice section, you can see there is quite a bit of variability among the Nukeproof bars we tested depending on clamp size and rise. We’ve been testing the 35mm clamp, 25mm rise version for several weeks now, and it is definitely the stiffest of the models included in this buyer’s guide. Beyond stiffness, the Horizon V2 has a crowd-pleasing shape with a natural feeling 9° back sweep and 5° upsweep, and it comes in three rise options, 12mm, 25mm, and 38mm to dial in your perfect bar height. It comes in 80mm and 780mm widths, and the 80mm version has cut lines down to 680mm (although we’d expect the flex characteristics to change at that width).</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://nukeproof.com/products/horizon-v2-carbon-riser-bar\">Nukeproof Horizon V2 Carbon</a> has a classy finish that’ll look good on just about any bike, along with common touches like stem setup lines and textured areas in the stem clamp and control zones for a little extra grip. It’s not the lightest carbon handlebar around at 258g (35mm clamp, 25mm rise), but it’s lighter than aluminum and is among the most affordable carbon bars at $150. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://nukeproof.com/products/horizon-v2-carbon-riser-bar\">Check Price at Nukeproof</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tStout But Balanced\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fchromag-bza-handlebar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChromag BZA\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$200</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Carbon fiber</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>230g (25mm rise)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>800mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Clamp Diameter</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>35mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rise Options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>15mm, 25mm (tested), 35mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Sweep</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>9° back, 5° up</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chromag-BZA.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1641\" height=\"1094\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chromag-BZA.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Handlebars of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chromag-BZA.jpeg 1641w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chromag-BZA-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chromag-BZA-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chromag-BZA-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chromag-BZA-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chromag-BZA-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chromag-BZA-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Precise handling</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightweight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Looks great</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Available in 3 rise options</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not quite as compliant as some</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Fairly expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Chromag is known and loved for being a core brand and has a loyal following. They make everything from hardtail and full suspension frames to some of the most popular flat pedals on the market. Their parts catalog also includes a range of cockpit components including stems, grips, and several models of handlebars including the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fchromag-bza-handlebar\">carbon fiber BZA</a>. Most of the products they make seem geared towards hardcore all-mountain and gravity riders, and that’s true of the BZA handlebar which they claim to be “Big, burly, and badass!”</p><p></p><p>The BZA certainly fits that description, but it manages to do so without being particularly punishing to the hands. Yes, it is stiff and it feels super precise in every handling scenario, but at the same time, it does a very respectable job of dampening vibration and providing a relatively calm, muted feel. In the Faction test lab, it definitely tested a bit over the average in terms of its stiffness, but its ability to absorb vibration on the trail proved to be better than some aluminum bars that tested to be more compliant. Still, they are on the stiffer side of the spectrum and best suited to aggressive riders and riding styles, yet they definitely feel, and tested, to be more compliant than Chromag’s OSX Aluminum handlebars.</p><p></p><p>The BZA comes in the 35mm clamp size and a standard 800mm width and they weigh in at just 230g (25mm rise). Three rise options are available including 15mm, 25mm, and 35mm, so most riders should be able to find their ideal bar height. At 9° back and 5° up, the sweeps are angled such that most riders should get along with them nicely. The BZA is impeccably finished, and while the branding is a bit more prominent than some other bars, the black/grey we tested look pretty awesome, and it’s hard to deny that the Chromag bear logo looks pretty darn cool.</p><p></p><p>While the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fchromag-bza-handlebar\">Chromag BZA</a> is often sold at $200, we’ve seen them going for much less at various retailers online, including the Chromag site. The $200 retail price seems a bit spendy, but if you find these on sale they are a much better value. Regardless of price, this is a lightweight carbon handlebar that provides impressive control without beating up your hands. If you’re looking for something a little more forgiving, the Chromag Cutlass (very similar but with a 31.8mm clamp size) was notably more compliant in the lab testing. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fchromag-bza-handlebar\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081TGRVD7/?tag=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tA Burly Bar for Aggressive Riding\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F214812%2Fenve-m7-handlebar-35-mm\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tENVE M7\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$190</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Carbon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>243g (25mm rise)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>800mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Clamp Diameter</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>35mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rise Options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>10mm, 25mm (tested), 40mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Sweep</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>8° back, 4° up</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ENVE-M7-Handlebar.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"1634\" height=\"1089\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ENVE-M7-Handlebar.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Handlebars of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ENVE-M7-Handlebar.jpeg 1634w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ENVE-M7-Handlebar-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ENVE-M7-Handlebar-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ENVE-M7-Handlebar-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ENVE-M7-Handlebar-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ENVE-M7-Handlebar-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ENVE-M7-Handlebar-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Classy looks</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Precise handling</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>3 rise options</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Comes with decal sheet for color matching to wheels</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Doesn't mute feedback quite as well as some other carbon options</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The carbon fiber experts at ENVE are perhaps best known for producing some of the most lust-worthy wheels on the market for some time, but they also make a growing range of other parts including bike frames, stems, and handlebars for both road and mountain bikes. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F214812%2Fenve-m7-handlebar-35-mm\">ENVE M7</a> is one of four mountain bike handlebars in their lineup, fitting in between the trail-oriented M6 and the DH-specific M9. While it’s technically a gravity-oriented bar aimed at enduro racers and DH riders, it graces the cockpits of many aggressive trail riders’ bikes as well. </p><p></p><p>This is a burly handlebar made for the most aggressive riding, so it’s stiff and feels super responsive, and despite falling around the middle of the stiffness scale of the models testing (25mm rise version) in the Faction Bike Studio lab, it has a slightly more rigid ride quality than those numbers suggest. While it may flex around the average in the lab, that doesn’t necessarily translate into use on the trail as it transmits more feedback and doesn’t mute high-frequency vibration quite as well as some other carbon options, but in our most recent testing, we found that it doesn’t feel excessively harsh either. That said, heavier riders or those pushing hard on rowdy descents who demand precise handling response will be the most delighted by its performance. </p><p></p><p>The M7 is the only handlebar in the ENVE lineup that comes in a 35mm clamp diameter, and that is the only size offered. It comes in a relatively standard 800mm width and can be trimmed down to a minimum width of 760mm while preserving its flex characteristics. It is offered in three rise options, 10mm, 25mm, and 40mm, all of which share a relatively neutral 8° backsweep and 4° upsweep. As is typical of all ENVE products, it has a classy-looking finish in matte black with classic logos. Plus it comes with a decal sheet with numerous colors to match your ENVE wheels or other parts.

They make a range of mountain bike handlebars in both aluminum and carbon fiber, but the <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/2227671/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FProTaper-A25-Handlebar-810mm-25mm-Rise-31-8mm-Aluminum-Polished-Silver%2F3469842472&amp;subId1=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar\">ProTaper A25 Aluminum</a> stands out for its high level of compliance, nearly on par with the much more expensive Roost Titanium handlebars. </p><p></p><p>With their aluminum handlebars, ProTaper has seemingly taken a straightforward approach without any obvious trickery in terms of design. While ProTaper says they “have never stopped pushing the limits of metallurgy”, this bar is otherwise exactly what it sounds like, a simple aluminum handlebar. For many, that simplicity may be just what they’re looking for, especially those seeking a super-compliant option. In fact, the three ProTaper AL models we tested (all 31.8mm clamp size) were among the most compliant we tested in the Faction Bike Studio Lab. That said, there is a bit of variability, as they become slightly more compliant as the rise increases among the three options offered, 12mm, 25mm, and 50mm. </p><p></p><p>ProTaper makes their AL bars in both the 31.8mm and 35mm clamp sizes, although we only tested the 31.8. They come in a generous 810mm width and have trim lines down to 720mm as well as markings on the stem clamp area and by the controls to facilitate setup. The 8° back sweep and 4° upsweep are relatively neutral and comfortable, and the option of 12mm, 25mm, and 50mm rise should make it so most people can find a rise to suit their needs. They come in raw silver, black, half silver/half black, and a limited edition throwback gold (25mm rise only).</p><p></p><p>With a weight of 317 grams (31.8mm clamp, 25mm rise), the <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/2227671/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FProTaper-A25-Handlebar-810mm-25mm-Rise-31-8mm-Aluminum-Polished-Silver%2F3469842472&amp;subId1=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar\">ProTaper A25</a> is competitive with most other aluminum bars, plus it’ll be a bit lighter if you trim it down from its full 810mm width. What stands out most about this handlebar, however, is its high level of compliance that takes the edge of big hits and gives it a ride feel similar to the Roost Titanium bars at just a fraction of the cost. But, at $105, it is a bit more expensive than the other aluminum options we have listed here. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a

Writing about cycling gear is more than just a job, riding bikes is also our passion, and we’re always on the hunt for products that can improve our experience out on the trails. Over the years, we learned that even a component as seemingly simple as the handlebar can enhance our comfort and control while mountain biking. And, we’ve been fortunate to test out lots of different handlebars to find what we like best. Still, there are so many handlebars on the market with various claims about their performance characteristics, that it can be tricky to find the perfect handlebar for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more, we teamed up with Faction Bike Studio to do <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/does-handlebar-compliance-make-a-difference-faction-bike-studio-blind-test/\" target=\"_blank\">compliance testing in their lab</a> to get some real data on the stiffness and compliance of 42 different handlebars. Then, we rider-tested a selection of those handlebars to see if the differences in stiffness/compliance were noticeable on the trail and what impact it had on our comfort and control. We found that there are notable differences among the bars we tested and that the lab findings lined up with the rider experience. Review author, Jeremy Benson, was one of the test riders for the handlebar testing project. As someone who has struggled with numb hands and arm pump while riding, Jeremy has spent years searching for the perfect handlebar that provides the ideal balance of forgiveness and responsiveness, and he has tried over 30 different models in the past few years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started our testing by gathering 42 handlebars and having them sent to Faction Bike Studio in Granby, Quebec for compliance testing in their lab. Each handlebar was put through the same compliance test to measure the deflection, or flex, under a predetermined amount of weight applied. These numbers gave us data to compare the handlebars in terms of stiffness and compliance, as there is otherwise no standard rating system or scale. After the lab testing, we chose 4 models for rider testing, and you can check out this article and the accompanying video to see how we tested and what we learned. In addition to testing the handlebars in the lab and on the trail for our video project, Jeremy tested all twelve of the handlebars included in this buyer’s guide to get a feel for how each model performs out on the trail. Our recommendations are based on his real-world testing experience and are informed by the results of the Faction Bike Studio lab testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Faction-handlebar-swap-2-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Faction-handlebar-swap-2-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Simon Ayotte from Faction Bike Studio swaps out handlebars during our rider testing session\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Faction-handlebar-swap-2-scaled.jpeg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Faction-handlebar-swap-2-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Faction-handlebar-swap-2-800x1067.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Faction-handlebar-swap-2-90x120.jpeg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Faction-handlebar-swap-2-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Faction-handlebar-swap-2-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Faction-handlebar-swap-2-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-test-riding-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-test-riding-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Adam Robbins from Faction Bike Studio riding while testing handlebars for our compliance testing project\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-test-riding-1-scaled.jpeg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-test-riding-1-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-test-riding-1-800x1067.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-test-riding-1-90x120.jpeg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-test-riding-1-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-test-riding-1-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-test-riding-1-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>We teamed up with Faction Bike Studio to do a handlebar compliance testing project that included compliance testing in their test lab along with blind rider testing to see if we could notice the differences on the trail.

In the following sections, we’ll discuss important factors like different materials, geometries, stiffness/compliance, weight, and more to help you wade through the multitude of options on the market if you’re looking for something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Material</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The two materials that are most commonly used in mountain bike handlebars are carbon fiber and aluminum. In many cases, some brands even make the same handlebar in both options. There are also a small handful of handlebars made from Titanium on the market these days. One of the primary factors that differentiates these materials is price, but there are other differences we’ll cover below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OneUp-Carbon-Handlebar-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OneUp-Carbon-Handlebar-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding with the OneUp Carbon handlebar on a ridge top trail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OneUp-Carbon-Handlebar-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OneUp-Carbon-Handlebar-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OneUp-Carbon-Handlebar-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OneUp-Carbon-Handlebar-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OneUp-Carbon-Handlebar-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OneUp-Carbon-Handlebar-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OneUp-Carbon-Handlebar-1-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OneUp-Carbon-Handlebar-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Carbon fiber allows manufacturers, like OneUp Components and others, to produce handlebars with specific performance characteristics.

One of the primary benefits of carbon handlebars for many riders is that they are dramatically lighter than their aluminum counterparts, often weighing in the neighborhood of 70 to 100 grams less (depending on the models in question). While that may not matter to everyone, it is one of the more cost-effective ways to shave that much weight off a complete bike. Additionally, carbon fiber has a good ability to absorb high-frequency vibration, comparatively speaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth noting that in the compliance (flex) testing at the Faction Bike Studio lab, the average stiffness of the carbon handlebars we tested was <em>slightly</em> higher than the aluminum competition. Of course, that is an average taken from our sample of handlebars and doesn’t tell the whole story, particularly given carbon’s vibration-absorbing properties. In fact, we’d argue that most of the carbon handlebars in the middle of the stiffness compliance spectrum actually do a better job of dampening vibration and muting feedback than similarly compliant bars made from aluminum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary drawback to carbon fiber as a handlebar material is that it has a higher manufacturing cost that results in prices that can be as much as double, or more, than an equivalent aluminum option. And, while carbon fiber handlebars are incredibly strong, they can be more prone to damage from blunt impacts, crashes, or possibly even the over-tightening of stem bolts or bar clamps for your controls. We always recommend using a torque wrench when tightening anything on your bike, particularly when dealing with carbon components. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-group-shot.jpeg\"><img width=\"9504\" height=\"6336\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-group-shot.jpeg\" alt=\"A selection of handlebars showing the different materials used in their construction\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-group-shot.jpeg 9504w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-group-shot-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-group-shot-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-group-shot-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-group-shot-768x512.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Aluminum handlebars, like the shiny silver ProTaper bar pictured here, are made of material that’s less expensive to produce, so they typically cost a bit less but weigh a bit more. (photo/Felix Burke)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aluminum</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the industry-wide adoption of carbon fiber as a material for use in the construction of just about everything, aluminum was just about the only game in town for mountain bike handlebars. Comparatively speaking, aluminum is less expensive as a material, and producing components like frames and handlebars is easier and therefore less costly. Still, it can be manipulated into a wide array of shapes and sizes, although it is a bit more limited in terms of tunability compared to carbon fiber. And, while it is fairly lightweight, aluminum handlebars almost always weigh quite a bit more than their carbon counterparts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results of the Faction Bike Studio compliance testing in the lab showed us that, on average, aluminum handlebars are <em>slightly</em> more compliant than their carbon counterparts. That is a very broad generalization of course, as some aluminum bars are super stiff, but overall, aluminum bars are a bit more forgiving in terms of stiffness. That said, beyond the flex of an aluminum handlebar, the material itself doesn’t absorb vibration quite as readily as carbon fiber, in our experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roost-Titanium-handlebar-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roost-Titanium-handlebar-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Testing the Roost Titanium Riser hanldlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roost-Titanium-handlebar-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roost-Titanium-handlebar-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roost-Titanium-handlebar-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roost-Titanium-handlebar-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roost-Titanium-handlebar-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roost-Titanium-handlebar-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roost-Titanium-handlebar-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Roost-Titanium-handlebar-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Titanium isn’t the most common material used in their construction but it makes for a very compliant handlebar and the raw finish of the Roost bars has a timeless appeal. (photo/Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Titanium</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Titanium is the least common material used in mountain bike handlebars, but brands have been making frames and handlebars out of it for many decades. In fact, I have a super narrow Bontrager Titec handlebar on my vintage ’93 custom hardtail out in my garage. Titanium has long been used in high-end bike frames, as it has a unique and forgiving ride quality compared to steel or aluminum. Not surprisingly, that translates pretty directly to handlebars, and the Roost Titanium bars we tested are roughly 30% more compliant on average compared to both the carbon and aluminum models we tested. If you’re after the most forgiving bar, particularly for bigger impacts, the Roost Titanium bars are it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not surprisingly, Titanium is quite expensive, and the models we tested are some of the most spendy handlebars on the market. That said, Titanium also has a reputation for being incredibly durable, so the higher price may be justified by its long lifespan.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-clamp-diameter-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-clamp-diameter-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Measuring the clamp diameter of a mountain bike handlebar with a caliper\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-clamp-diameter-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-clamp-diameter-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-clamp-diameter-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-clamp-diameter-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-clamp-diameter-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-clamp-diameter-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-clamp-diameter-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-clamp-diameter-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>If you don’t see it printed anywhere on the handlebar, measuring the clamp area with a caliper can tell you what the diameter is. (photo/Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Clamp Diameter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mountain bike handlebars come in either 31.8mm or 35mm clamp diameters, and quite a few are offered in both sizes. If you’re getting a new handlebar to replace your existing one (and you don’t want to replace your stem too), then you’ll want to be sure you get the same clamp size. The size is typically printed somewhere on the handlebar, usually in the clamp zone that gets covered by the stem, but if not, you can measure the diameter with a caliper.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years, the 31.8mm clamp diameter was considered the “standard” until several brands started making bars and stems with a 35mm clamp interface. Initially, the move to 35mm clamp diameters was to increase both the stiffness of the bar/stem interface and the handlebars themselves, and the general perception was that all 35mm clamp bars were stiffer than 31.8mm. While that may have been true for a short time, it is by no means a hard and fast rule and we’d call it an oversimplification. These days, the stiffness of a bar is dictated more by its design and construction than by its clamp diameter, and there are super stiff and very compliant bars in both sizes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, we did notice in the results of our lab testing in the sample of bars we tested, that the average stiffness of those with a 35mm clamp was, in fact, just <em>slightly</em> higher than those with a 31.8mm clamp. Again, this is a broad generalization, but a notable trend nonetheless. Regardless of clamp size, most riders should be able to find a handlebar that suits their preferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stem</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The stem of your mountain bike is a pretty straightforward component that simply attaches your handlebar to your fork’s steerer tube. As such, along with your handlebar, your stem is part of a system that is used to control your bike. Mountain bike stems come in a wide array of shapes and sizes that can play a role in your bike fit (bar height and reach), and varying levels of stiffness that can have a minor impact on the responsiveness of your handling. Depending on the stem, some can have a bit of flex, while others are ultra-stiff, so that can be a factor that’s worth considering when upgrading your handlebar, especially if you’re going to a different clamp size and need to purchase a new stem anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the topic of bike fit, altering the length of your stem is an easy way to effectively increase or decrease the length of your reach, which can play a large role in your comfort as well as your bike’s handling. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-geometry-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-geometry-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A look at the measurements of the Hope Carbon Handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-geometry-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-geometry-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-geometry-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-geometry-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-geometry-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-geometry-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-geometry-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-geometry-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Many, but not all, handlebars have their measurements printed on them somewhere.

(photo/Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mountain bike handlebars come in a vast assortment of rises, sweeps, and widths, all of which can play a role in your body position, wrist alignment, and overall comfort on the bike. And, by making changes to any of those dimensions, you can adjust the ergonomics and fit of your cockpit to dial it into your specific needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Width</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of decades, mountain bike handlebars have (thankfully) trended wider which has helped improve both stability and handling leverage for our increasingly capable bikes. While it varies somewhat by brand and model, most handlebars for trail or gravity riding come in the neighborhood of 780mm to 800mm in their uncut, stock width. Handlebars on XC bikes tend to be a bit narrower, and the lightweight <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FRace-Face-Next-SL-35-Handlebar\">Race Face Next SL</a> is a good example that comes in a 740mm width. While the stock width of a handlebar might be a great fit for some riders, our bodies come in all different shapes and sizes, and more often than not, most riders could benefit from trimming a new handlebar to a more appropriate width to get a better fit.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-width-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-width-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A look at the trim lines on the ONeUp Aluminum handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-width-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-width-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-width-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-width-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-width-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-width-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-width-1-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-width-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Handlebar width is a personal preference. Most handlebars have trim lines on the ends to facilitate cutting them down to the right width for your body. (photo/Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Handlebars that are too narrow can result in less stability and control, while bars that are too wide can stretch your arms out too far and negatively impact your handling or comfort in other ways. Determining the right width can be a little tricky, but if you have a handlebar that you already know is a good fit for you, it could be as easy as measuring that one and trimming your new bar to match. Otherwise, we suggest using a calculated approach because cutting your handlebar is permanent. Remember, you can always make it narrower, but you can’t put material back on, so start slowly unless you are confident that it is right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Handlebar manufacturers anticipate that their bars will be getting trimmed and most come marked with measurement lines on the ends to make it a little easier. It isn’t too difficult to trim a handlebar on your own (there are some great tips online), but if you are unsure or don’t have the tools, any local bike shop should be able to help you out.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A look at the handlebar rise of the ENVE M7 handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Rise is a measurement of how high the handlebar rises moving out from the middle to the ends as you can see here on the ENVE M7 with a 25mm rise. Preferences and needs vary, of course, but changing the rise of your handlebar can impact your bike’s fit and comfort. (photo/Jeremy Benson) </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rise</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The rise of a handlebar refers to how high a handlebar rises over its length out toward both ends and it is typically measured in millimeters. Rise is relatively important to consider as your handlebar height can have a large impact on your body position, weight distribution, and overall comfort on the bike. For this reason, many handlebars are offered in several rise options to suit varying needs and preferences, while others are only offered in a single rise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like anything else, there is no one-rise-fits-all, and what works best is typically a matter of personal preference or potentially the type of bike that you’re riding. If, for example, you feel excessive pressure on your hands while riding, it could be that your handlebar is a little low and that pressure could be relieved by using a bar with a higher rise that shifts your body position slightly more upright. Conversely, if the front end of your bike feels too high, prone to wandering, or you’re looping out on steep climbs, lowering your bar height with a lower-rise handlebar could help fix the problem. It’s also worth mentioning that adjusting the position of the spacers above or below the stem can have a similar effect on your bar height. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-comparison-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-comparison-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A comparative look at eight different mountain bike handlebars.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-comparison-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-comparison-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-comparison-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-comparison-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-comparison-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-comparison-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-comparison-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-rise-comparison-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The handlebars in this photo range in rise between 20mm and 35mm. Small differences in rise can adjust your bar height and body position to dial it into your specific needs. (photo/Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The right amount of rise may also be influenced by the type of riding you’re doing. Cross-country racers who prioritize pedaling speed and efficiency will often ride in a more aggressive, forward-leaning position, so it’s not uncommon to see flat or 10mm rise bars on lightweight XC bikes. Conversely, those who ride super steep terrain frequently will often opt for a higher-rise handlebar to raise up the front end of the bike and help prevent their body weight from being too far forward while descending steeper pitches. Again preferences vary, but finding the right rise for you is an important aspect of having your cockpit setup dialed in for comfort and performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SQlab-30X-Carbon-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SQlab-30X-Carbon-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Looking down at the back sweep of the SQlab 30X Carbon handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SQlab-30X-Carbon-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SQlab-30X-Carbon-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SQlab-30X-Carbon-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SQlab-30X-Carbon-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SQlab-30X-Carbon-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SQlab-30X-Carbon-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SQlab-30X-Carbon-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SQlab-30X-Carbon-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The sweep angles, both up and back, can impact your wrist alignment and comfort.

(photo/Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Back Sweep and Upsweep</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving out from the center of the handlebar, the ends of handlebars are angled both up and back, and these angles are referred to as upsweep and back sweep. These angles are intended to provide better alignment of the hands and wrists when gripping the handlebar in the riding position. There aren’t really “standard” upsweep and back sweep angles, although the sweet spot for most riders is around 8° or 9° back and 4° or 5° up as evidenced by the fact that the majority of handlebars on the market fall into that range. There are outliers, of course, like the <a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/products/controls/handlebars/carbon-handlebar/\">Hope Carbon Handlebar</a> with a <em>slightly more aggressive</em> 7° back sweep or the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fhandlebars%2Fpnw-components-range-35-handlebar-v3%23image%3D221902%2F901807%2Fpnw-components-range-35-handlebar-v3\">PNW Range Gen 3</a> which has a <em>somewhat more relaxed</em> 10° back sweep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some riders can benefit from more improved ergonomics and wrist alignment offered by handlebars that have more back sweep than the normal range mentioned above, and fortunately, a few brands offer products to meet that need. One such handlebar is the SQlab 30X Carbon (or aluminum) which can be purchased with either 12° or 16° of back sweep. While that much back sweep isn’t necessarily ideal for everyone, it may be exactly what some riders need to ride more comfortably. It is worth noting that increasing back sweep effectively shortens reach, so those opting for more extreme angles like 12° or 16° may need to consider adjusting stem length to compensate. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-roll-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-roll-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Adjusting the roll of a mountain bike handlebar while installing it.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-roll-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-roll-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-roll-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-roll-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-roll-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-roll-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-roll-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-roll-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Adjusting the roll of a handlebar can impact how the sweep angles line up with your hands and have noticeable effects on its ergonomics and comfort.

When setting up your handlebar, you want to position it so that the back sweep and upsweep are aligned in the position that feels best <em>for you</em>, and that is done by “rolling” the handlebar forward or back in the stem. Even slight changes to bar roll can play a big part in your wrist alignment and how a handlebar feels against your palms. Changes to bar roll are quite easy to make, so this is relatively easy to experiment with to find out what works best. Just be sure to reposition your controls and grips to the correct angles if you are making changes to the bar roll.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-controls-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-controls-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Simon Ayotte test riding mountain bike handlebars with proper setup of his controls\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-controls-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-controls-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-controls-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-controls-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-controls-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-controls-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-controls-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-controls-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Proper setup of your controls, the shifter and brake levers, is also an important element of dialing in your mountain bike’s cockpit for maximum comfort and control. (photo/Felix Burke)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Control Setup</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up your controls (shifters and brake levers) properly can also impact your wrist alignment and impact your comfort. Ideally, you want your shifter paddles and dropper lever to not interfere with your thumb while gripping the handlebar but still be close enough that you don’t have to reach excessively to press on them. Similarly, the lateral position and reach of your brake levers should be adjusted to suit the length of your fingers so that you can reach them easily. And, let’s not forget your choice of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-grips/\">mountain bike grips</a> as that can impact your comfort as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The angle of your brake levers is arguably the most important here as it is most likely to impact how your wrists are aligned when gripping the handlebar and reaching for the levers. If your levers are <em>too flat</em> or <em>too steep</em> it can cause your wrists to bend too much in one way or the other. Of course, what works best is a matter of personal preference and may also be dictated by the type of riding that you’re doing. Just like bar roll, adjusting the position and angles of your controls is quick and easy, so trying different things to dial it in is pretty straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-shot-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-shot-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Adam Robbins riding into a a section of chunky rocks while testing handlebar compliance\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-shot-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-shot-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-shot-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-shot-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-shot-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-shot-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-shot-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-shot-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Preferences vary when it comes to the stiffness of a handlebar, but a little compliance can provide some added comfort when you’re blasting full speed into rough, rocky terrain. (photo/Felix Burke)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stiffness vs Compliance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Compliance is a popular buzzword in the cycling industry that is used to describe components that provide some forgiveness through flex, and it is used by many handlebar manufacturers to characterize the performance of their products. Compliance is essentially the opposite of stiffness, and it refers to a material or object’s ability to flex under load. While flex may not sound like the most desirable trait in a handlebar, compliance can work to absorb some of the forces from impact which can be beneficial and improve rider comfort. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advancements in materials and construction methods have allowed brands to tune handlebars to achieve desired performance characteristics whether that’s super stiff, very compliant, or somewhere in between. Without an industry-wide compliance test “standard”, however, it’s hard to know where different handlebars line up on the stiffness/compliance scale compared to each other. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in 2023, we partnered with Faction Bike Studio to do a first-of-its-kind <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/does-handlebar-compliance-make-a-difference-faction-bike-studio-blind-test/\">mountain bike handlebar compliance test</a>. We tested 42 different handlebars in Faction’s lab with a standardized flex test to see how they vary in terms of stiffness and compliance (see the graph below to compare), and then we did some blind rider testing to see if the lab test results are noticeable in use and how that translates out on the trail.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stiffness-all.png\"><img width=\"1210\" height=\"452\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stiffness-all.png\" alt=\"A bar graph showing the stiffness of all the handlebars tested in Faction Bike Studio's lab.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stiffness-all.png 1210w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stiffness-all-297x111.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stiffness-all-800x299.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stiffness-all-120x45.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stiffness-all-768x287.png 768w\" /></a><figcaption>This graph shows all 42 of the handlebars tested in Faction Bike Studio’s lab in order from stiffest (left) to most compliant (right). “C” stands for Carbon and “AL” stands for Aluminum. (graph/Faction Bike Studio)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, there are some pretty dramatic differences in terms of stiffness, and in our testing, we determined that those differences are, in fact, noticeable while riding. Believe it or not, there are some handlebars that can provide enhanced comfort through impact and vibration absorption, but, just like anything else, how stiff or compliant your handlebar should be comes down to rider preference. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stiff handlebars are known for being super precise and provide responsive handling, but sometimes it comes at the cost of comfort. On the other hand, compliant handlebars are known for providing more comfort, but sometimes at the cost of handling precision. Handlebars in the middle of the stiffness scale will typically provide the most balanced characteristics, where they provide a little extra comfort without sacrificing much in terms of handling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Rider testing mountain bike handlebars with Faction Bike Studio's Adam Robbins and Simon Ayotte\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-1-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-testing-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>After testing handlebar compliance in the lab, we did some blind testing with Adam and Simon from Faction Bike Studio to see if we could notice the differences out on the trail. Note the handlebars are obscured from view so we couldn’t tell what we were riding. (photo/Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many modern handlebars, particularly those made from carbon fiber, are being constructed with specific layups that allow for some vertical compliance to absorb impact while remaining horizontally stiff for handling and control. Those performance traits can be hard to balance, but some brands and models of handlebars are doing it quite effectively. Carbon fiber, and particularly all of the interfaces of composite structures, does a better job of absorbing vibration and helping to dampen high-frequency feedback that may otherwise be transferred to the hands compared to other materials. But, as you can see in the graph above, many of the stiffest bars we tested also happen to be made from carbon. Still, one of our favorite carbon handlebars is the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F166238%2Foneup-components-carbon-handlebar\">OneUp Components Carbon</a> as its unique ovalized shape and carbon construction provide an amazing balance of compliance, vibration absorption, and handling precision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like carbon handlebars, those made from aluminum vary pretty dramatically in terms of stiffness/compliance, but on average, we found them to be <em>slightly</em> more compliant in the lab testing. Regardless, there is a big range from super stiff to more compliant which can be seen in the graph above. Six of the ten most compliant bars are aluminum and two of the ten stiffest bars are aluminum, so you have the option to choose your preferred stiffness. It’s worth noting, however, that aluminum doesn’t absorb high-frequency vibration quite as well as carbon fiber can, generally speaking, although the bars on the more compliant end of the spectrum do help absorb bigger impacts quite effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Titanium is much less common as a material for handlebars, mostly because it is more expensive, but it is known for providing a unique, comfortable ride feel when used as a frame-building material. This translates pretty directly to the handlebar application, and our lab testing showed that the three titanium models we tested were the most compliant compared to aluminum or carbon fiber. On the trail, that difference is noticeable and they definitely do absorb some of the impact forces from larger hits. And, while we found the handling to feel a tiny bit vague initially, it didn’t take long at all to get used to it. The raw titanium also looks awesome, which doesn’t hurt either. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-weight-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-weight-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Hope Carbon Handlebar on a scale, weighing in at 222 grams.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-weight-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-weight-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-weight-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-weight-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-weight-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-weight-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-weight-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Handlebar-weight-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Weight is a consideration for some riders, and carbon handlebars like the Hope Carbon shown here are typically the lightest. (photo/Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Weight</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The weight of a handlebar probably shouldn’t be the most important factor in deciding what to buy, but for the weight-conscious among us, it is possible to save weight on your bike with an upgrade if you choose. With most aluminum handlebars weighing in around 300g to 340g and most carbon bars ranging from around 200g to 250g, it’s possible to reduce the overall weight of your bike by around 100g (3.5 oz) or so. While that may seem insignificant to many riders, there are plenty of folks who might appreciate the benefits of having a lighter overall bike weight, and compared to some other components, the price-to-weight difference between a carbon bar and an aluminum one is easier to stomach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those riders looking to save the most weight on a light XC race bike, for example, there are several super light handlebars on the market. The lightest one we’ve tested is the <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FRace-Face-Next-SL-35-Handlebar\">Race Face Next SL</a> which comes in at a scant 167g at its untrimmed 740mm width. While that width won’t appeal to everyone, it is well chosen for the XC application where bars tend to be a bit narrower than those used by trail and enduro/gravity riders. Moving up slightly in weight, many of the wider, burlier carbon bars are still very light with models like the Hope Carbon handlebar (222g), <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingmountainbikehandlebar&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F166238%2Foneup-components-carbon-handlebar\">Oneup Carbon</a> (228g), Chromag BZA (230g), and the FSA Gradient carbon (237g) weighing shockingly little compared to comparably sized aluminum options.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Race-Face-Next-SL-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Race-Face-Next-SL-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Race Face Next SL Handlebar mounted on a super light XC race bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Race-Face-Next-SL-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Race-Face-Next-SL-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Race-Face-Next-SL-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Race-Face-Next-SL-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Race-Face-Next-SL-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Race-Face-Next-SL-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Race-Face-Next-SL-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Race-Face-Next-SL-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Race Face Next SL Handlebar is super light and most appropriate on lightweight XC bikes where low weight is a priority. (photo/Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Value</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t have to spend a lot to get a handlebar that will be a performance upgrade over the stock aluminum handlebars that come on a lot of complete mountain bikes. The aluminum models we tested range in price from $69 to $109, and there are plenty of other options on the market that are priced similarly and will outperform the basic options that many manufacturers spec on bikes to save money. The cost of a handlebar rises as the material gets fancier and the weight comes down, and carbon fiber handlebars fall in a price range of around $150 to $200. While that is obviously more expensive than the aluminum options, the weight savings is fairly significant and we feel the performance helps to justify the higher price tag. Going up a price level, niche products made from exotic materials like Titanium or that have specific features like extra back sweep seem to command more money. While a Titanium handlebar or 12-16° back sweep won’t appeal to everyone, they exist for those who need or want them, just know that you’ll be paying a little extra to get it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why should I upgrade my mountain bike handlebar?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>There are a number of reasons to upgrade your mountain bike handlebar. First, unless you bought a high-end complete bike, the stock handlebars that come on most bikes are super basic aluminum options chosen for their cost savings and not their performance. Sure they work fine, but just about any aftermarket handlebar will perform better. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, you can alter the fit and, therefore, your comfort on the bike by getting a handlebar that has a shape that works well for you. By altering the rise, sweeps, and width of your handlebar, you can dial it in perfectly for your riding style, body position, wrist alignment, etc, for better ergonomics, and ultimately improved comfort and control of your bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, handlebars vary dramatically in terms of stiffness, so it’s possible to get one that fits your desired performance characteristics. Want something stiff and precise, compliant and forgiving, or something in between? Well, there are lots of options to choose from. And, just like the right fit can improve comfort, you can also improve hand, wrist, and upper body comfort by using some of the more compliant handlebars that help absorb impact and vibration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourth, you can also reduce the overall weight of your bike by switching from aluminum to carbon fiber. That won’t matter to everyone, but it is among the more cost-effective ways to shave weight off your bike.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Is spending more for a carbon or titanium handlebar worth it?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>While it probably won’t be worth it for everyone, we think that the performance benefits justify the asking price of carbon or Titanium handlebars for serious riders. For carbon bars, the weight savings is notable, and to us, carbon’s ability to absorb high-frequency vibration is definitely noticeable in back-to-back comparisons (though it varies somewhat by the model in question). Also, the ability for manufacturers to tune carbon handlebars to perform in specific ways means you can probably find a bar that meets your needs and wants and changes the overall ride feel of your bike. Realistically, a nice carbon handlebar costs about the same as a new set of mountain bike tires (at retail prices), and it will last a heck of a lot longer, so we feel it is money well spent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Titanium handlebars are among the most expensive on the market, but they can also provide tangible benefits for some riders. Given their impressive levels of compliance, they can be a great option for those seeking a more forgiving ride feel that helps prevent arm pump or your hands from going numb.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What’s the most compliant handlebar?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Roost’s Titanium handlebars proved to be the most compliant of all the handlebars we tested in Faction Bike Studio’s lab by roughly 30% compared to the average compliance of the other handlebars made from aluminum or carbon fiber. This was also quite noticeable on the trail as the Roost bars provided a comfortable ride quality and helped take the edge off larger impacts in particular. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several aluminum handlebars, but most notably the ProTaper A25 and A50 models were almost as compliant as the Roost Titanium bars in the lab testing and provided a similar ride feel. Surprisingly, however, some of the carbon handlebars that fall in the middle of the compliance spectrum provide a more damp, muted feel due to carbon’s ability to absorb high-frequency vibration more effectively.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What’s the stiffest handlebar?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>The stiffest handlebar we tested is the Nukeproof Horizon V2 Carbon (35mm clamp, 12mm rise). In fact, four of the ten stiffest bars we tested were Nukeproof Horizon V2 carbon models in various clamp sizes and rises. These are burly handlebars made for precision on rough DH tracks at high speeds. Not to be outdone, however, three FSA Gradient Carbon handlebars are in the top ten stiffest handlebars too. And, two Chromag OSX Aluminum models also compete among the stiffest bars we tested in Faction’s lab. So, if you prioritize stiffness, you’ve got options.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>My hands go numb while riding, which handlebar is best for me?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>If you suffer from hand numbness, wrist discomfort, or arm pump while riding, a more compliant handlebar can often help reduce the amount of feedback and vibration transmitted through the bars and into your hands and upper body. Of the models we tested, the Roost Titanium bars were the most compliant in the lab testing we did with Faction Bike Studio. Not far behind was the ProTaper A25 Aluminum handlebar, which also costs significantly less. That said, we’ve found some of the carbon bars that fall in the middle of the stiffness/compliance spectrum, like the OneUp Components Carbon, to provide excellent comfort due to carbon’s ability to mute high-frequency vibration that would otherwise be transferred to the hands.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How do I know what clamp diameter I need?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>If you’re upgrading or replacing your handlebar and you don’t want to purchase a new stem, then you’ll want to get the same size you already have, either 31.8mm or 35mm. Often, the clamp size is printed somewhere on the handlebar, so take a look around and see if you can find it. Hint: it may be hidden under the stem in the clamp area, so you may need to remove it from the stem to find this info. If you don’t see it printed anywhere, then using a caliper, if you have one, is an easy way to measure the diameter. Otherwise, bring your bike to a local bike shop, they should be able to help you out.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Are 35mm clamp handlebars stiffer?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Based on the results of the lab testing done at Faction Bike Studio, we found that on average, 35mm clamp diameter handlebars are <em>slightly</em> stiffer than 31.8mm. And, that those differences are <em>slightly</em> more pronounced in Aluminum handlebars than in carbon fiber. Still, those are just averages, and the differences in average stiffness are relatively minimal. Given the amount of variability in terms of stiffness, regardless of clamp diameter, it should not be assumed that a particular handlebar will be stiffer than another based on clamp size alone. The brand, model, material, and rise also play a role in a handlebar’s stiffness.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How do I know what rise I need?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Finding the ideal rise can be tricky, but having your handlebar at the right height is critical for rider comfort and also performance. If you feel too much pressure on your hands, then adding rise can often help. Similarly, if you find your weight too far forward on steep descents, adding rise may also be beneficial. On the flip side, if you find that your body position is too casual or upright most of the time or that there isn’t enough weight on the front end of the bike, reducing your rise might help. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to experiment without dropping cash on a new handlebar is to move the stem up or down by adjusting the position of the spacers above or below it. This effectively changes the height of your handlebar and gives you an idea if more or less rise would be helpful. If you’ve already maxed out or bottomed out your stem height and still feel the need to go higher or lower, then choosing a bar with more or less rise could be the solution.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n<div>\n\t<h2>Related Content</h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article>\n\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-grips/\">\n\t\t<img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MTB-grips-buyers-guide-feature-compilation-1.jpg\" alt=\"Best Mountain Bike Grips – Find the right MTB grip to smooth out your ride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MTB-grips-buyers-guide-feature-compilation-1.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MTB-grips-buyers-guide-feature-compilation-1-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MTB-grips-buyers-guide-feature-compilation-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MTB-grips-buyers-guide-feature-compilation-1-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MTB-grips-buyers-guide-feature-compilation-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MTB-grips-buyers-guide-feature-compilation-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" />\t</a>\n\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/buyers-guides/mtb/\">MTB Buyer’s Guide</a></div>\n\n<h2>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-grips/\">\n\t\tBest Mountain Bike Grips – Find the right MTB grip to smooth out your ride\t</a>\n</h2>\n\n<div>\n\t<p>Mountain bike grips seem simple, but in reality, an MTB grip is going to be the part of the mountain bike that you spend the…</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</article>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article>\n\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/\">\n\t\t<img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Shoes of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/buyers-guides/\">Buyers Guides</a></div>\n\n<h2>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/\">\n\t\tThe Best Mountain Bike Shoes of 2024\t</a>\n</h2>\n\n<div>\n\t<p>As a critical connection between you and your bike, finding the best mountain bike shoes is very important.
