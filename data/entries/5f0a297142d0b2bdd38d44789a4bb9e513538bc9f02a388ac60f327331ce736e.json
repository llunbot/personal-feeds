A YouTube Premium subscription takes care of that, but ad blockers <em>do</em> exist. Google seems to have gotten the message—a cheaper streaming subscription is on the way that drops YouTube Music from the plan. You may have to give up more than music to get the cheaper rate, though.</p>\n<p>Google started testing cheaper YouTube subscriptions in a few international markets, including Germany and Australia, over the past year. Those users have been offered the option of subscribing to the YouTube Premium plan, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/youtube-premium-gets-a-2-price-increase-now-13-99-a-month/\">runs $13.99 in the US</a>, or a new plan that costs about half as much. For example, in Australia, the options are AU$23 for YouTube Premium or AU$12 for \"YouTube Premium Lite.\"</p>\n<p>The Lite plan drops YouTube Music but keeps ad-free YouTube, which is all most people want anyway. Based on the early tests, these plans will probably drop a few other features that you'd miss, including background playback and offline downloads. However, this plan could cost as little as $7–$8 in the US.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/02/google-plans-cheaper-ad-free-youtube-subscription-without-music/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/02/google-plans-cheaper-ad-free-youtube-subscription-without-music/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5f0a297142d0b2bdd38d44789a4bb9e513538bc9f02a388ac60f327331ce736e","category":"Tech"}
