It's both a convenient way to watch movies without having to hunt across multiple services, and yet another shift by Plex to be closer to the mainstream.</p>\n<p>Plex's <a href=\"https://www.plex.tv/blog/welcome-to-rental-land-on-plex/\">first set of available films</a> is more than 1,000 titles, with some notable recent-run offerings: <em>Barbie</em>, <em>Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom</em>, <em>Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning</em>, <em>Wonka</em>, <em>PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie, </em>and so forth. As is typical of digital rentals, you have 30 days to start watching a movie and then 48 hours to finish it.</p>\n<p>Prices at the moment range from $3.99 to $5.99. Conveniently, movies you rent on one platform can be played on any other. Even on Apple devices, or, as Plex puts it, \"devices that don't allow direct rentals on their platform.\" Rentals are only available in the US, however.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002035#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002035&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"39420370e391e35e0a7053e9328b66489216ad59a00e0050527bc4acd32975a7","category":"Tech"}
