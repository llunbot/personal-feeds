The expanded warning was recently added to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/\">Chrome Canary</a>, a nightly build for developers. The warning appears to directly address one of the lawsuit's complaints, that the Incognito mode's warning doesn't make it clear that Google collects data from users of the private mode.</p>\n<p>Many tech-savvy people already know that while private modes in web browsers prevent some data from being stored on your device, they don't prevent tracking by websites or Internet service providers. But many other people may not understand exactly what Incognito mode does, so the more specific warning could help educate users.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996403#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996403&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"faf2169ed319d5660f47f05ead0d3a96b0362c67be59f85ef262e85cd70bc3fc","category":"Tech"}
