The 4-8Nm is easily adjustable and should cover stem, seat post, and seat binder torque needs. We highly recommend it for the new carbon bike owner!</p><p>If you like to transport your bike sans wheels or clean your chain without the wheel and cassette in your way (like the pros do), you need the <strong>Feedback Sports Chain Keeper </strong>($49 from <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F132436%2Ffeedback-sports-chain-keeper&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">REI</a>).

This portable washer isn’t a full-blown pressure washer; its max output is 130.5psi (compared to the Muc-Off pressure washer at 1450psi). That makes it perfect for washing the dog, bikes, kids, or shoes after a day in the woods. The Mobi plugs into your car’s accessory outlet, so you don’t need to worry about charging or batteries.</p><p>Is your derailleur hanger bent? That’s usually the first thing a tech will ask when you come to the shop explaining, “my bike isn’t shifting correctly.” The first process of derailleur adjustment is to check the hanger alignment, and a dependable tool for the job is the <strong>Park Tool DAG-2 Derailleur Alignment Tool</strong> ($79 from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T6L22E/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon</a>)<strong>.</strong> It’s easy to use, usually in-stock, and, most shops will tell you, nearly indestructible—a must-have for those building a bicycle toolset for a home workshop.</p><h2>Best Home Mechanic Gifts for Under $150</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10160118/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10160118/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars.jpg\" alt=\"best holiday gift ideas for a bicycle mechanic under 150 dollars\" width=\"2000\" height=\"551\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10160118/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars.jpg 2000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10160118/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars-297x82.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10160118/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars-800x220.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10160118/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars-120x33.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10160118/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars-768x212.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10160118/best-holiday-gifts-for-bike-mechanics-under-150-dollars-1536x423.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></p><p>If you like to bring your tools to the race or ride, one of our favorites is the <strong>Feedback Sports Ride Prep Tool Kit </strong>($139 from <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F114324%2Ffeedback-sports-ride-prep-tool-kit&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingmechanicgg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">REI</a>).
