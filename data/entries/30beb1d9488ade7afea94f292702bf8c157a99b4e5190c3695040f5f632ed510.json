One year ago, we relocated to Salt Lake City, Utah, from Golden, Colorado. I started a new job in an entirely new industry. While all good and beautiful, this change in my life had dramatic effects on my mental and physical health. When I don’t get outside into nature or disconnect fully from society, it impacts me negatively more often than I care to admit, and that also affects those around me.</p>\n<p>I had only pedaled my bike more than 30 miles at one time since the summer of 2023. The itch to get back out there had been growing, almost bleeding. Therefore, naturally, I had been daydreaming of a big, solo, self-supported, no services available, physically and mentally grueling state of being. Self-inflicted. Self-reflective. Self-reliant. Singlespeed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-5.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-5.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-6.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-6.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>These adventure rides usually do the trick for me. It’s the medicine that tastes so good you chew it before swallowing. The kind of effort where you have to turn yourself inside out mentally and physically to get it done. Like scrubbing off a layer of callus across your entire mind and body, awakening the senses, and taking the deepest breath of fresh air with zero pressure of the current reality.</p>\n<p>After I picked the route earlier in the week, the research began. I quickly learned there were no overnight camp permits available, so doing the full 100-mile route, with 7,700 feet of elevation gain, became my only option. An ever-growing checklist of things I had to do to prepare flooded my mind as I started rummaging to get ready. How much water should I bring? How many batteries should I charge? I had to acquire a day-use permit, restock my repair kit, and inject fresh sealant in my tires. With only a couple of nights to pack for a big day out, I procured a new set of shoes, a new helmet, and new gloves. I felt ready, just like no time had gone by at all since my last long ride.</p>\n<p>After a half day of work on Friday, I rushed home to throw everything in the car and head south. It’s about a four-hour drive to the starting point, but I still needed to buy snacks to carry with me. I ended up driving into Moab for that first, grabbed a bite to eat at a local burger joint, shared a few pints with other travelers, and headed out to camp. At 10:30 pm, using a headlamp in a parking lot of a BLM road, I mounted lights, filled bags with snacks (and wrenches), tightened bolts, slathered Loctite on bolts (more on this later), and adjusted tire pressure manually to have a clean start in the morning.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-19.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Bike</h3>\n<p>I am a predominantly singlespeed rider. It’s just what I love. Simplistic, affordable, destruction-free, pure efficiency, bare and natural – you get the point. So, now the wrenches and Loctite come back into the story. My current singlespeed is an MC5 – the fifth iteration of the Mountain Coaster from <a href=\"https://www.ratherproper.com/\">Proper Engineering</a>, coaster brake only, Reynolds 520 steel. These frames are produced by Marino in Peru and designed by Tyler Whetstone in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-42.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-42.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-42.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-42.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-45.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-45.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-45.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-45.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I couldn’t find my coaster cogs the night before while preparing, so I ran what was on there, 32 x 18, I think? I’ve got a biplane Monè fork and OddMonè bars up front. Maxxis Rekon+ 27.5 x 2.8 rubber for added extra comfort with low pressure on the rocky route. With a custom mini-cooler and flanges wrapped around the Shimano CB-E110 coaster hub and a chunky Monè steel torque arm mounted with a vintage quick-release skewer, covered in Loctite, my coaster setup felt dialed. There’s a dropper mounted, but the battery was dead, so it’s just an analog post holding my favorite beater saddle.</p>\n<p>Bags were a mix of whatever I found in my stash, including a <a href=\"https://dispersed.bike/\">Dispersed Bikepacking</a> frame bag off a previous bike I had it custom-made for, and a seat pack as a last-minute addition to hold a tub of grease, just in case. With 6L of water spread throughout and a Red Bull tucked away, I wouldn’t go thirsty on this trip. My front roll contained an emergency blanket and a first aid kit. I was raised in the rural Midwest, and I’ve learned the hard way that you always bring a bailout option when the route doesn’t have one guaranteed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Wake Up Call</h3>\n<p>I was up at 5:30 AM and had my coffee and oatmeal by 6:00. I got dressed, loaded the route, and was moving by 7:00. I knew I had 12 hours of sunlight, plus two more of dawn and dusk, so 14 hours was my soft prediction based on mileage and taking my time enjoying it. The forecast called for a high of 65ºF, mid-30ºF to start. My chosen start point was at the top of the mineral bottom climb, right where I slept.</p>\n<p>This set me up for a clockwise loop, with about twenty miles of gravel and pavement to start, leading me directly into the gut of the canyon with the famous Schafer switchbacks. Moments into this 1,500+ foot descent, it’s impossible not to stop every few feet to take in the view. Little did I know, this was only a primer for the entire day of nonstop photo ops and spots to pull off and explore. I had zero time commitment to finish this ride, so I took full advantage of every possible chance that I could.</p>\n<p>The entire route is remote. Desolate. No services are available, meaning no resupply opportunities. No real water access. And this early in the year, as I found, not enough off-road vehicle traffic to rely on if you needed some trail magic (more water, help, etc). In total, I recall encountering four vehicles, two motorcycles, and a couple of sets of cyclists in all of the one hundred miles. For 99% of my 15 hours on route, I was fully alone.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-8.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-8.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-6.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-6.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Moab has been a common getaway spot for me over the last five years. This was my first time in this specific area within Canyonlands National Park. The canyon layers in this zone are unlike anything else I’ve seen around the area. Throughout the route, I was circumnavigating the Green River and Colorado River, although I was only able to view water in several spots, and mostly hundreds of feet below. The White Rim name comes from the white limestone rock layer closest to the river before the rock surface turns to red sandstone.</p>\n<p>The route essentially follows a double-track road mixed with sections of slick rock, sand, light gravel, and dirt between layers of the river and the tallest sandstone monoliths. The vast scenic landscapes sit still like paintings on a museum wall, larger than life. The thousand-foot canyon walls calmly reminded me of how small and fragile human life is. The unique textures of the desert environment absorbed into all of my senses, bringing a refreshing joy back to balance out the mundane everyday moments. It’s like coming up for air, finally able to allow my knotted stomach to release and the airways to fully open.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-14.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>These rides are long enough to have chapters that I can palpably <em>feel</em>. I could spend hours describing how every ten miles felt like a story of its own. The pain of this couch-to-100-mile ride set in around mile 35. My legs weren’t ready, I started dehydrated, and mentally, I already had enough silence. Amidst the stunning and surreal landscape around me thus far, and the pain setting in, I was fully on a high of having the opportunity to be out here. But if I didn’t keep moving, I would certainly be out here overnight without enough calories to keep powering my body.</p>\n<p>I began hunting to cross the 50-mile mark, using halfway as an anchoring point to bring back some confidence. I stopped at mile 51 to lay down for a road nap, catch up on water, have a few snacks, and a Red Bull for dessert. I carried a satellite Garmin InReach for emergency communication if needed, and to keep close friends or family updated. One great friend of mine in particular, Aaron Apel, can always be reached in times of despair on these adventure rides for a boost when I need it most. We exchanged several messages during this break. Once Aaron knew the physical hole I’d dug myself into, he continued to ping me throughout the evening.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-28.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-28.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-26.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-26.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>After nearly an hour, I was rolling again and excited for the second half. Most of the interest points I planned for off-trail were still ahead, and about 8 miles in between each other. Holeman Slot Canyon was certainly a favorite. Only a few feet off the trail, a natural slope at ground level took me into this stunning, twisting, turning slot canyon where quickly the walls above rose over several stories tall. Next up was Black Crack, a fracture in the stone measuring three feet wide, 65 feet deep, and over 1,700 feet long.</p>\n<p>While exploring the crack, I could see the Colorado River off in the distance. I continued on the massive slab of sandstone and found the edge, which opened up to a full panoramic overlook view. It’s really hard to explain the feeling of such natural beauty, mixed with the physical endorphins surging through the body at the same time. This view brought rest and calmness, all while being so expansive. It felt boundless.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-29.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-29.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-29.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-29.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Back on the trail, the sun was sinking lower now. By mile 80, my spirits were redlining again. The endorphin release internally was matched with stunning beauty, satisfaction, and hope for everything in the current moment. By mile 90, my gas tank was running on empty. The wheels were falling off, metaphorically speaking.</p>\n<p>As I rolled by several campsites, I was greeted with a finish line approach of strangers jumping and cheering, “You got this! Epic! Finish this thing!” At first, I thought they got it wrong, maybe they thought I was someone else, but I accepted the bump in morale and considered it desert magic, smiled, and rolled on. Several turns later, I heard a voice holler from the pitch black air, “Are you good? Need anything?” Car lights began approaching as I started up a nearly two-mile-long climb of 1,500+ feet to finish at the car.</p>\n<p>Grades were upwards of 25%, and I told myself, “When this car passes, hitchhike if you can. You made it far enough.” Then, they disappeared. Instantly vanishing. Back to Plan A: finish it! I walked the entire two miles of the final climb, pushing the 40-pound steel bike up the road.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-33.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025_White_Rim_Coaster_Brake-33.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This route was perfect on a coaster brake bike. No hand brakes brought an even simpler approach to the mechanical freedom of riding a singlespeed.</p>\n<p>It’s commonly said that the bicycle provides freedom, that nature heals, and life goes on. For me, experiencing the White Rim trail proved the truth of those phrases.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com/white-rim-coaster-brake/\">Barren But Beautiful: White Rim on a Coaster Brake</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"30beb1d9488ade7afea94f292702bf8c157a99b4e5190c3695040f5f632ed510","category":"Cycling"}
