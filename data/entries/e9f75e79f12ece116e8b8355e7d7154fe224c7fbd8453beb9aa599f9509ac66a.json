It’s the bio-mechanical side of “Big S,” where <em>biomechanical tweaks</em> through insoles and wedges can make you faster. The goal is to make your legs act like efficient pistons, with solid knee tracking and a platform to pedal. Specialized does a great job at marketing this effort, and I’ve used their insoles for years religiously — they work well and last long. Body Geometery’s goal for the Ares is stability, comfort, and power. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-boas--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-boas--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Ares 2 boas\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-boas--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-boas--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-boas--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-boas--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-boas--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-boas--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-boas--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><br />(Photo: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>How do you take a race-drive shoe and make it as comfortable as your joggers? </em>This task led to a few innovations and updated some older ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here’s what’s packed into the Ares 2:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Varus Wedge (1.5mm):</strong> Aligns foot, knee, and hip for better stability and power.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Metatarsal Button: </strong>Prevents nerve compression and dreaded “hot foot.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Longitudinal Arch Support: </strong>Stops arch collapse, turning your foot into a rigid power lever.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wider Toe Box:</strong> Allows natural toe splay for comfort without compromising performance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Tim_Merlier_1.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1205\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Tim_Merlier_1.webp\" alt=\"Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Tim_Merlier_1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Tim_Merlier_1.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Tim_Merlier_1-297x179.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Tim_Merlier_1-1536x925.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Tim_Merlier_1-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Tim_Merlier_1-768x463.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Specialized)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>No Watt Wasted</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of the Ares 2 isn’t just about power but seamless power delivery. The stiff carbon outsole, secure closure, and locked-in fit ensure that every ounce of effort translates directly into forward motion. I’d say they achieved that with the new design. It’s comfortable, lightweight, and takes zero time to break in. Heres what Primož Roglič thinks;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“I’ve never felt more connected to my bike. I push on the pedals, and my bike jumps. Plus, no hot spots or discomfort, even on long days.”</em> – Primož Roglič—Red Bull–BORA–Hansgrohe’s race-winning powerhouse—backs it up:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“The S-Works Ares 2 provides a maximum connection between the rider and the bike. There’s no lag. If you sneeze, that power and movement will go straight to the pedals.”</em>– Rob Cook, Specialized Design Director of Footwear</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Modelsjpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1294\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Modelsjpg.webp\" alt=\"Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Modelsjpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Modelsjpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Modelsjpg-297x192.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Modelsjpg-1536x994.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Modelsjpg-120x78.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized_S-Works_Ares_Modelsjpg-768x497.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Image: Specialized)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>S-Works Ares 2 Specs &amp; Pricing</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sizes: 36–49 (with half sizes from 38.5–46.5)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 247g (size 42.5, half pair)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Colors: White (tested), Team White, Black, Green Gecko</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price: $600</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Availability: Now</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Ares 2 top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><br />(Photo: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>First Impressions: A Big Step Forward, But at a Cost</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been a fan of the Specialized road footwear for some time now. I faded out when the S-Works 7 road shoe came out, though; I couldn’t get a fit where the forefoot wasn’t crushed under the load of the Boa. When the S-Works Torch lace-up came out, they eliminated that feeling, and I could finally enjoy the shoes. The fit of Specialized shoes has grown over the years, especially for those with wider feet. It seems every iteration of the shoe gets slightly wider year-to-year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-weight--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-weight--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Ares 2 weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-weight--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-weight--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-weight--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-weight--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-weight--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-weight--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-weight--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><br />(Photo: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve only had time for two weeks on the Ares 2, but the message is clear—this is an incredibly comfortable, watt-coaxing, race-focused shoe.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-boa-string--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-boa-string--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Ares boa string\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-boa-string--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-boa-string--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-boa-string--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-boa-string--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-boa-string--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-boa-string--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-boa-string--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><br />(Photo: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How Do They Fit? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Slipping on the S-Works Ares 2, I first noticed how much better the fit was than the original Ares.

I’ve battled with the original S-Works Ares (mostly to get them on my foot), and this is the most comfortable Specialized shoe I’ve worn. The fit gives the same “free foot” sensation as the original model but has more substance and support. I have slightly wide feet, and shoes (like saddles) are very personal.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top-side--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Ares 2 top side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top-side--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top-side--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top-side--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top-side--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top-side--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top-side--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-2-top-side--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><br />(Photo: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ride Impressions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the bike, the support is noticeable; the shoe feels like an extension of the foot, delivering smooth, efficient power with no wasted movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shoe feels incredibly responsive on the road, but the most significant difference is the comfort. The shoe is more comfortable than any other Specialized shoe I’ve tried directly from the box. It usually takes me a bit to break in a set of shoes, including a ride in the rain. The Ares2, however, is very malleable and works with the rider’s foot rather than forcing it into a shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-vs-torch-sides--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-vs-torch-sides--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Ares vs torch sides\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-vs-torch-sides--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-vs-torch-sides--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-vs-torch-sides--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-vs-torch-sides--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-vs-torch-sides--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-S-Works-Ares-vs-torch-sides--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Comparison S-Works Torch vs. S-Works Ares 2 (top))</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s Up With That Price?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>But then there’s the elephant in the room: </em></strong>the price. Cycling gear isn’t getting any cheaper, but even in an industry where costs keep climbing, the Ares 2 pushes the limits of what most riders can justify spending on race shoes. It’s an outstanding piece of kit—no question—but one that few will experience simply because the price tag puts it out of reach for most riders. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The S-Works Ares 2 is a no-compromise race shoe built for those who demand the absolute best. If you’re looking for locked-in security, maximized power transfer, and a fit that feels molded to your foot, the S-Works Ares 2 will abide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/shop/cycling-clothing/cycling-shoes\">www.specialized.c</a><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/s-works-ares-2/p/1000227980?color=1000228147-1000227980\">om</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-s-works-ares-2-road-cycling-race-shoe/\">$600 Specialized S-Works Ares 2 Shoes Adds More Comfort &amp; 7 Watts to Your FTP</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e9f75e79f12ece116e8b8355e7d7154fe224c7fbd8453beb9aa599f9509ac66a","category":"Cycling"}
