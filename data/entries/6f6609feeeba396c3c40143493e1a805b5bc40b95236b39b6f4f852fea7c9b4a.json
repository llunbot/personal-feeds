Italy has two races on the calendar this year, and this was the first, the (deep breath) \"Formula 1 AWS Gran Premio Del Made in Italy e Dell'Emilia-Romagna,\" which took place at the scenic and historic (another deep breath) Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, better known as Imola. It's another of F1's old-school circuits where overtaking is far from easy, particularly when the grid is as closely matched as it is. But Sunday's race was no snoozer, and for a couple of teams, there was a welcome change in form.</p>\n<p>Red Bull was one. The team has looked a bit shambolic at times this season, with some wondering whether this change in form was the result of <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/articles/single-seaters/f1/the-key-staff-who-quit-red-bull-f1-strategy-chief-is-latest-departure/\">a number of high-profile staff departures</a> toward the end of last season. Things looked pretty bleak during the first of three qualifying sessions, when Yuki Tsunoda got too aggressive with a curb and, rather than finding lap time, found himself in a violent crash that tore all four corners off the car and relegated him to starting the race last from the pit lane.</p>\n<p>2025 has also been trying for Ferrari. Italy expects a lot from the red team, and the replacement of Mattia Binotto with Frédéric Vasseur as team principal was supposed to result in Maranello challenging for championships. Signing Lewis Hamilton, a bona fide superstar with seven titles already on his CV, hasn't exactly reduced the amount of pressure on Scuderia Ferrari, either.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/f1-in-imola-reminds-us-its-about-strategy-as-much-as-a-fast-car/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/f1-in-imola-reminds-us-its-about-strategy-as-much-as-a-fast-car/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
