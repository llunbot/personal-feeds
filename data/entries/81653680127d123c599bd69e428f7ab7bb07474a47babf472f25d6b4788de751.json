{"title":"The Logo for King Charles’s Coronation Was Designed by Jony Ive","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64599029","date":1680217200000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/30/disney-1-desantis-0\">Speaking of King Charles III</a>, I’ve been meaning to link to this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The design was inspired by King Charles’s love of the planet,\nnature, and his deep concern for the natural world,” said the\nformer Apple design guru, who is more usually associated with\nsleek tech designs of equipment such as iMacs and iPods.</p>\n\n<p>The logo, to be used for events over the coronation long weekend\nin May, features a rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock - emblems\nfrom across the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>It’s in contrast to the very stark design of the new King Charles\nstamps revealed this week, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64554857\">which has no crown or\ndecoration</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s a lovely mark — one that should clearly stand the test of time. It would have looked good 100 years ago and should look good 100 years from now.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/30/king-charles-logo\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"81653680127d123c599bd69e428f7ab7bb07474a47babf472f25d6b4788de751","category":"Tech"}
