[...]</p>\n\n<p>A robust expansion of the “For All Mankind” universe, “Star City”\nis a propulsive, paranoid thriller that takes us back to the key\nmoment in the alt-history retelling of the space race — when the\nSoviet Union became the first nation to put a man on the moon. But\nthis time, we explore the story from behind the Iron Curtain,\nshowing the lives of the cosmonauts, the engineers and the\nintelligence officers embedded among them in the Soviet space\nprogram, and the risks they all took to propel humanity forward.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can’t think of another show quite like <em>For All Mankind</em>. For one thing, there just aren’t many “alternate history” shows or movies, even though I tend to think it’s a great genre — a way to ground fantastic inventions with familiar elements. But the biggest distinction is the way <em>For All Mankind</em> has decade-long gaps in the timeline between seasons. We’ve seen some characters age 30+ years over just four seasons.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/23/for-all-mankind-season-5\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"bebcb89a505d72252dbb73d9c1014ca6b125b7131ed17eb8b0737b11acf6f1ba","category":"Tech"}
