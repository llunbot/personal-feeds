Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>SAN FRANCISCO—Newsflash: The new electric Cadillac Escalade IQ weighs over 9,000 lbs, or a fair amount more than 4,000 kilograms. For context, that figure works out to almost exactly half again as much as the 682 hp (509 kW) Escalade V that comes equipped with a barking-mad 6.2 L supercharged V8. Yet the latest and supposedly greatest from Cadillac needed to weigh so very much to achieve a class-leading range target of 460 miles (740 km), thanks to a 205 kWh battery pack.</p>\n<p>The Escalade IQ shares a modular General Motors (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/general-motors-is-ditching-ultium-branding-for-its-ev-batteries/\">formerly Ultium</a>) chassis and battery pack with the gargantuan <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/driving-the-biggest-least-efficient-electric-car-the-hummer-ev-suv/\">Hummer EV</a>, and even more hardware with the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/the-2024-chevrolet-silverado-evs-great-range-comes-at-a-high-cost/\">Silverado</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/the-2025-gmc-sierra-ev-denali-brings-big-power-at-a-bigger-cost/\">Sierra</a> pickup truck siblings. As opposed to trying to attract rugged work truck and off-roading cred, though, for Cadillac that kind of range figure seemed necessary to appeal to a \"no compromise\" lifestyle that Escalade buyers might well expect while considering a switch to fully electric power.</p>\n<p>And the new IQ certainly puts down plenty of instantaneously available grunt, and despite its mass, it can punch out a 0–60 time in under five seconds with the Velocity Max button pushed, thanks to dual motors rated at 750 hp (560 kW) and 786 lb-ft (1,065 Nm).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-2025-cadillac-escalade-iq-first-drive-460-miles-on-a-single-charge/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-2025-cadillac-escalade-iq-first-drive-460-miles-on-a-single-charge/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Michael Teo Van Runkle","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1d4501c6cda81a5690053bce79ba12e47962eccda1e04db31ae5f4c6573cfcf3","category":"Tech"}
