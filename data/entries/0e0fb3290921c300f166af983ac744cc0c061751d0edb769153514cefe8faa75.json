How good a deal is it? The model that’s on sale is Apple’s mid-tier configuration which usually sells for $2,699, so you save $250. But even better: The $2,449 sale price is lower than the price of the low-end 16-inch M2 Pro MacBook Pro (which is at its regular price on Amazon). So you get more MacBook for a lower price!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mid-tier model has an M2 Pro chip with a 12-core CPU, 19-core GPU, 16GB of memory, and a 1TB SSD. All MacBook Pros come with three Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports, an HDMI port, an SDXC card slot, and a headphone jack to connect all your gear. Don’t worry about using a Thunderbolt port for charging, because the laptop also has a MagSafe 3 charging port and adapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the ideal laptop for pros on the go. It has a lot of processing power, and this model’s 1TB drive is a good size for most users. The big, 16-inch display is glorious to look at–in my <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480214/16-inch-macbook-pro-m2-pro-review.html\">review of the 16-inch M2 Pro MacBook Pro</a>, I said the display is, “the best display Apple has used on a laptop to date.”</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0e0fb3290921c300f166af983ac744cc0c061751d0edb769153514cefe8faa75","category":"Apple"}
