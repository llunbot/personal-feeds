He can ride a bike very fast. He is The Next Eddy Merckx™. He has as much alcohol-free beer as he can stomach, and <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/05/the-beer-remco-didnt-drink/\">sometimes even remembers to open it.</a></p><p>But all of these pale in comparison to one thing: his lucrative Pizza Hut endorsement deal.</p><p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/remco-evenepoel-is-the-face-of-pizza-hut/\">As we shared in March</a>, Evenepoel signed a five-year contract with the pizza chain – an alliance that was described in an accompanying press release as a “tasty collaboration”.</p><p>In the months since, Evenepoel has been doing his level best to promote a pizza brand that he appears to find almost sinful:</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Indeed, given how long Evenepoel goes between his “cheat days”, it seems that it’s the team staff of Deceuninck-Quick Step that are the real beneficiaries of the sponsorship deal:</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Nonetheless, Evenepoel’s partnership with Pizza Hut continues to bear fruit for his sponsor, which – in brutal news for Belgium – claims to be “the tastiest pizza chain in Belgium”.</p><p>As Het Nieuwsblad <a href=\"https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20210817_92112814\">reports</a>, the young Belgian recently filmed a commercial. Even more exciting news, however, is that there’s going to a new item added to the menu: the ‘Remco’ pizza.</p><p>What does that look like? We do not know for sure, but Pizza Hut has teased some clues: company CEO Stef Meulemans claims that “it will be a recipe without meat and with lots of vegetables that our new face also likes.”</p><p>A deep scroll of Evenepoel’s social media profiles reveals <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BNmfRoDggCL/\">some big moods</a> for a 16-year-old, but does not disclose whether he is actually vegetarian – or indeed, what vegetables he and his face like.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-lombardia-corvos-4-1340x894.jpg\"><figcaption>At Il Lombardia, Evenepoel crashed off a bridge and landed on a rotting fowl. Is this the origin story for his current preference for vegetarian pizza? I’m not ruling it out.</figcaption></figure><p>That leaves us with some guesswork.</p><p>Olives? Perhaps! Capers? Why not. Baby spinach? Carrot? Fetta and sundried tomatoes? Girthy slabs of swede? Whole brussels sprouts? A massive eggplant looming resplendent from the marinara sauce?</p><p>All of these could be on the Remco. We don’t know. We just know that it’s coming to a Pizza Hut near you, if you’re in Belgium.</p><p>More on this vital story as we have it.</p></div></div>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"29f47f93e182447131f38a547ab415f6d3cc8b0426bca41d8bc48be8259c8086","category":"Cycling"}
