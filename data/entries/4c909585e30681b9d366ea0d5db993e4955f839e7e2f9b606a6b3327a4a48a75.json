The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/16/iphone-15-pro-usb-c-port/\">iPhone 15 Pro's USB-C port</a>, replacing the Lightning port on current models, also appears to necessitate a slightly larger bottom cutout.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost noticeably, the cases accommodate the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/24/iphone-15-pro-will-not-have-mute-switch/\">new mute button</a> that is set to replace the long-standing mute switch above the volume buttons. Since the button does not need to be gripped from the side and slid across like a switch, it appears to require less space and can utilize a smaller cutout.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne of the cases features some kind of insert that is placed over the mute button when the device is in the case, similar to the other buttons on most <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> cases. The button is also expected to serve as a multi-purpose Apple Watch Ultra-style <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/iphone-15-pro-action-button-rumor/\">Action Button</a>, likely allowing users to perform functions like running Shortcuts in addition to activating or de-activating mute.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>iPhone 15 Pro Max Case <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/apple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#apple</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/iphone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#iphone</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/iphone15promax?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#iphone15promax</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DfRuoXWNiL\">pic.twitter.com/DfRuoXWNiL</a></p>— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1672691211528806400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 24, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother case shared by Twitter user \"Majin Bu\" may indicate that the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ will feature larger camera lenses and a bigger microphone. This accessory also seems to retain allowances for a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-15-pro-solid-state-volume-rocker/\">unified volume rocker</a>, but this design change is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/kuo-iphone-15-pro-no-solid-state-buttons-after-all/\">no longer expected</a> to arrive this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther design updates rumored for the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/02/iphone-15-pro-features-specs-rumors/\">titanium chassis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/21/iphone-15-pro-ultra-thin-curved-bezels/\">slightly curved</a> front and rear edges, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/21/iphone-15-pro-ultra-thin-curved-bezels/\">slimmer bezels</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/16/iphone-15-pro-renders/\">thicker camera array</a>.
