Members of the National Electric Highway Coalition say they serve nearly 120 million customers across 47 states and the District of Columbia. The coalition hasn’t said how many fast chargers it will be installing, but the companies said they would focus first on gaps in existing fast-charging networks along interstate highways.</p>\n<p>The group is “committed to investing in and providing the charging infrastructure necessary to facilitate electric vehicle growth and to helping alleviate any remaining customer range anxiety,” said Tom Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, which helped build the coalition.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818699#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818699&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6b221a97efb00af2855af57c45f196b1d45f86b7d537c114fb6465ee3f6435f4","category":"Tech"}
