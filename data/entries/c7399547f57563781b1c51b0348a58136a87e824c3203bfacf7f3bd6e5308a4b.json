{"title":"Flash deal: Get three Apple USB-C cables for (almost) the price of one","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2778620/flash-deal-get-three-apple-usb-c-cables-for-almost-the-price-of-one.html","date":1747066999000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though your iPhone comes with a cable, it never really hurts to have an extra (or three) lying around so you don’t have to worry about what will happen if you lose one, or you don’t have to hunt one down when in need of a recharge. Well, Woot has a fantastic offer right now, selling <a href=\"https://sellout.woot.com/offers/value-packs-apple-usb-c-woven-charging-cable-bulk-packaging\">three official Apple cables for $22</a>, a savings of 61% off its $57 MSRP. Considering Apple usually sells these for $19, you’re basically getting two free. And if you’re an Amazon Prime member, you’ll get free shipping, which is pretty great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The catch is that these cables come in bulk packages, which means they have a polybag and a plain brown box, rather than a branded Apple box. But these are genuine non-refurbished Apple cables, and the only reason why they’re being sold this way is because they’re excess units that Apple decided to liquidate to wholesale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you don’t mind your 3.3-foot type-C woven cables from Apple come without a pretty white package, then you’re good to go. You don’t even need to get three cables if you don’t need that many. Single cables can be purchased for $10 (47 percent off), while a two-pack is available for $17 (55 percent off).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to be super fast, though, because <a href=\"https://sellout.woot.com/offers/value-packs-apple-usb-c-woven-charging-cable-bulk-packaging\">this deal will expire at the end of today</a>. Woot deals will also expire when stocks run out, so if you want one you need to hurry up.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save up to 61% on Apple USB-C cables</span><div><a href=\"https://sellout.woot.com/offers/value-packs-apple-usb-c-woven-charging-cable-bulk-packaging\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Woot</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c7399547f57563781b1c51b0348a58136a87e824c3203bfacf7f3bd6e5308a4b","category":"Apple"}
