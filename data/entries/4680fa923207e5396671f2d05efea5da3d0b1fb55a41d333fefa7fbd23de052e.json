{"title":"Rotten Tomatoes Is Rotten","link":"https://www.vulture.com/article/rotten-tomatoes-movie-rating.html","date":1694033845000,"content":"\n<p>Lane Brown, writing for Vulture:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But despite Rotten Tomatoes’s reputed importance, it’s worth a\nreminder: Its math stinks. Scores are calculated by classifying\neach review as either positive or negative and then dividing the\nnumber of positives by the total. <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about\">That’s the whole formula</a>.\nEvery review carries the same weight whether it runs in a major\nnewspaper or a Substack with a dozen subscribers.</p>\n\n<p>If a review straddles positive and negative, too bad. “I read some\nreviews of my own films where the writer might say that he doesn’t\nthink that I pull something off, but, boy, is it interesting in\nthe way that I don’t pull it off,” says Schrader, a former critic.\n“To me, that’s a good review, but it would count as negative on\nRotten Tomatoes.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>Another problem — and where the trickery often begins — is that\nRotten Tomatoes scores are posted after a movie receives only a\nhandful of reviews, sometimes as few as five, even if those\nreviews may be an unrepresentative sample. This is sort of like a\ncable-news network declaring an Election Night winner after a\nsingle county reports its results. But studios see it as a\nfeature, since, with a little elbow grease, they can sometimes\nfool people into believing a movie is better than it is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Brown also uncovers implicit payola, with a Hollywood PR firm paying small-time critics tracked by Rotten Tomatoes $50 (fifty measly bucks!) for positive reviews. My whole family has been growing ever more skeptical of Rotten Tomatoes scores for years, but we reached a breaking point earlier this year when we rented <em>M3gan</em>, which we all found to be a shitty movie, but <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/m3gan\">scored a 93 from Rotten Tomatoes</a>. (It has a “generally favorable” <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/m3gan\">72 from Metacritic</a>.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/06/rotten-tomatoes-is-rotten\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4680fa923207e5396671f2d05efea5da3d0b1fb55a41d333fefa7fbd23de052e","category":"Tech"}
