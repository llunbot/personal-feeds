Trump's false claims helped fuel the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944197#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944197&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3bce17e6effc074fcf9fddea02ee2cadf0bdf410f9926c46a5763552f7b3b876","category":"Tech"}
