One thing we really didn’t like was that they were too pricey, but that’s obviously not going to be a problem considering the deep price slash it just received.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headphone’s ANC feature is, as mentioned, pretty fantastic, including Apple’s excellent Transparency mode. As we wrote in our review, “Most high-end noise-canceling headphones have some sort of transparency mode that leaves noise canceling active but uses the microphones to pipe in a bit of outside sound, so you can hold a quick conversation or hear other important sounds around you. Apple’s transparency mode is light-years ahead of everyone else’s. It sounds more clear, natural, and normal than any other noise-cancelling headphones I have ever used. It’s almost like not wearing headphones at all, except you can still hear your music.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another cool feature you’ll enjoy when your headphones get delivered is the dynamic head tracking, something that will give you an immersive experience when listening to supported shows and movies, or even music, making it feel as if it’s coming from all around you. <strong>Just note: This deal is for the Lightning model, which was discontinued in September and replaced with a USB-C model. But other than a fw new colors, that’s the only change.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So take the chance to get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Wireless-Over-Ear-Headphones-AppleCare/dp/B08PZDSP2Z/\">AirPods Max for $400 at Amazon</a> in this early Prime Day deal.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get the AirPods Max for close to their best price</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Wireless-Over-Ear-Headphones-AppleCare/dp/B08PZDSP2Z/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"da22b8acedf22e4a3f87d136e0a0b1fc37b8db98ea2f1a80df4b0acf31d9c68f","category":"Apple"}
