Its focus lies on web accessibility, with a new author exploring a topic each day — from web accessibility to all the different types of programming languages you may want to explore for your projects. Once logged in, you can save a spot on the calendar and have your article or work published on that particular day.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n<blockquote>Do you happen to know any other advent calendars that have been created in languages other than in English?

It was a pretty cool WebGL advent calendar that featured a daily new experiment that was quite obviously made with love by digital artists. Unfortunately, it did not continue after the 2018 edition.<br />\n  </p><ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/christmasxp\">@christmasxp on Twitter</a></li>\n  </ul>\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>24 Accessibility (2019)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.24a11y.com/\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a947a3c2-c96e-45e7-9a27-5488f3a8e0f1/24-a11y-logo-18-opt.jpg\" /></a>An advent calendar we surely miss is the <a href=\"https://www.24a11y.com/\">24 Accessibility</a>. The site hasn’t had a new article since 2019, but still offers a good resource of articles on all subjects related to digital accessibility. Whether you are new to accessibility or a veteran, a developer, designer, user experience professional, quality assurance analyst or project manager, you’ll find an article of interest during the run of the series.<br />\n  </p><ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.24a11y.com/feed/\">RSS Feed</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/24accessibility\">@24accessibility on Twitter</a></li>\n  </ul>\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>It’s A Shape Christmas (2019)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://itsashapechristmas.co.uk/\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a42bacde-cedc-48d4-a06a-295ac90ad0ad/shape-christmas-logo-200px.png\" /></a><a href=\"https://itsashapechristmas.co.uk/\">It’s A Shape Christmas</a> is a digital calendar that counts down to Christmas and reveals a bespoke illustration each day themed around four different shapes (Square, Triangle, Circle and Hexagon) and Christmas. The project was started in 2011 by a UK design agency called <em>Made by Shape</em>. The website still showcases some of the best from the previous seasons. I’m sure you’ll agree: they’re all just too good not to be shared! ✨<br />\n  </p><ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/shapechristmas\">@shapechristmas on Twitter</a></li>\n  </ul>\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>24 Ways (2019)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://24ways.org/\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f4641212-86e0-49e0-a270-512acc6e4329/24-ways-advent-2018.png\" /></a>First initiated by Drew McLellan, <a href=\"https://24ways.org/\">24 ways</a> started out as a simple website that published a new tip or trick each day leading readers through December up until Christmas. It launched in <a href=\"https://24ways.org/2005\">2005</a> and still has all of the calendars available online. Unfortunately, the last one was published in 2019 and will be taking a well-earned break after that year’s “final countdown”.<br />\n  </p><ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://feeds.feedburner.com/24ways\">RSS Feed</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/24ways\">@24ways on Twitter</a></li>\n  </ul>\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>Perl Advent (2020)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://perladvent.org/archives.html\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/69912810-b90a-4e98-939f-6e122273a17a/perladvent.png\" /></a>The <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/\">Perl Advent</a> started back in <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2000/\">2000</a> and is perhaps the longest running web advent calendar that many know of. You’ll find insightful articles written by diverse author submissions from all types of Perl programming levels. A different Perl module will be featured each day for the twenty four days of advent, and an extra module on Christmas day.

Some of the tips are probably common knowledge for many, yet each of the posts cover so many of the important aspects of accessibility that will still hold true for years to come.<br />\n  </p><ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://kittygiraudel.com/rss/index.xml\">RSS Feed</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KittyGiraudel\">Kitty Giraudel on Twitter</a></li>\n  </ul>\n<p></p>\n\n\n\nLast But Not Least...\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SmashingAdvent?src=hashtag_click\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7483fb45-4dc0-492a-aee5-f7b133abcc18/smashingconf-advent.png\" /></a>Of course, we wanted to join in the fun ourselves and brought our very own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SmashingAdvent?src=hashtag_click\">#SmashingAdvent</a> to life!
