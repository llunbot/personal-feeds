{"title":"Vuelta a España 2024 stage 10 preview - an opportunity for the breakaway","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/vuelta-a-espana-2024-stage-10-preview","date":1724601201000,"content":"\n      <p><span><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday 27 August, 2024<br /></span><span><strong>Distance:</strong> 160km<br /></span><span><strong>Start location:</strong> Ponteiras<br /></span><span><strong>Finish location:</strong> Baiona<br /></span><span><strong>Start time:</strong> 13:30 CET<br /></span><span><strong>Finish time (approx):</strong> 17:19 CET</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>Located on the Vigo Bay on the Pontevedra coast, at the western end of the region of Galicia, Baiona is part of a geographically distinct network of coastline inlets called the Rías Baixas. It </span><span>is believed</span><span> that these inlets formed coastal land along river valleys that sunk due to tectonic action and </span><span>were then flooded</span><span> with water from the ocean. Proximity to the Atlantic Ocean means marine life flourishes here, and fishing has historically been the </span><span>main</span><span> part of Baiona’s economy. </span><span>However, these days </span><span>it</span><span> is tourists</span><span> who flock here for the beaches in the summer that bring in the most money.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Rías Baixas also forms one of Spain’s leading wine regions. It’s known for its crisp, dry white wines made </span><span>mostly</span><span> from the Albariño grape, which is resilient enough to withstand the area’s rainy climate. Situated near the coast and grown on low-lying land, those with a sensitive palate may even detect subtle salty flavours in the wines. </span></p>\n<p><span>Though much of this stage of the </span><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Vuelta a España</span></a><span> (which starts inland in Ponteareas and finishes at Baiona on the coast) remains mostly at sea level, the multiple bumps make it a day for the puncheurs. In fact, the road heads uphill just 12km after setting off from the start upon reaching the foot of Alto de Fonfria, a 15.4km effort averaging 4.2% that should ensure the break is composed only of strong climbers. Things do ease up after the summit, with a 15km descent followed by a 55km stretch of flat as the riders head west, but the climb should be enough for a group to form and gain a substantial gap. </span><span>And given that the rest of the stage doesn’t quite look hard enough to interest the GC riders, it seems odds on that whatever break has formed here won’t be caught by the peloton.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Come the final half of the stage</span><span>, it</span><span> will likely be a matter of picking the right moment to attack out of the break in search of stage victory. The Alto de Mougás would appear to be the </span><span>obvious</span><span> springboard, given that it is the hardest (9.9km at 6%) and crested just 20km from the finish, the</span><span> </span><span>last climb of the day. </span><span>But</span><span> a tactically savvy move could be to slip clear </span><span>either</span><span> alone or as part of a smaller group on </span><span>either</span><span> the Alto de Vilachán or Alto de Mabia that precedes it to get a head start.</span><span> Being the strongest rider in the break might not be enough to take victory; you might also have to be the smartest.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/vuelta_stage_10_352215e8-3e40-4960-a4ef-b162bb2c9b2e.jpg?v=1723555764\" alt=\"Vuelta a España 2024 stage 10 preview\" /></div>\n<p><span><i>Stage profile sourced via Vuelta website </i></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Contenders</strong></h3>\n<p><span>We are placing our bets on the breakaway </span><span>making</span><span> it to the line first, and with the first rest day just gone, legs will be fresh, and those attackers looking for a stage victory will be eager to open their second week on a positive note. </span></p>\n<p><span>Israel-Premier Tech have two strong cards to play when it comes to winning a stage from the breakaway. </span><strong><span>Michael Woods</span></strong><span> has had a consistently strong Vuelta </span><span>so far</span><span> and could look to secure a victory here. But so could their two young riders </span><strong><span>Riley</span><span> Sheehan </span></strong><span>and </span><strong><span>Matthew Riccitello</span></strong><span>, who will no doubt like to secure a Grand Tour stage win on their debuts. Another Vuelta debutant who may be given the go-ahead for the stage win could be <strong>Isaac del Toro</strong> (UAE Team Emirates). He will be strong over this type of terrain and will be a rider to watch. At the other end of his career, </span><strong><span>Thomas De Gendt </span></strong><span>(Lotto Dstny) is in this Vuelta with a stage win on his agenda, rounding off his final Grand Tour. </span></p>\n<p><span>Lidl-Trek could use </span><strong><span>Carlos Verona</span></strong><span> or </span><strong><span>Mathias Vacek</span></strong><span> to aim for a win from the break if either of those can get into it. Vacek came close to winning a stage on the opening time trial and on stage seven, placing second place behind Wout van Aert, and if he can get into the break and stay with the bunch, he will be a real contender for the stage win. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Attila Valter </span></strong><span>will also be a contender for Visma-Lease a Bike and Movistar will have </span><strong><span>Pelayo Sánchez </span></strong><span>and </span><strong><span>Nairo Quintana</span></strong><span> as potential stage winners in Baiona. Other riders could also be </span><strong><span>Florian Lipowitz</span></strong><span> (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), who sits fourth on the youth classification so far, or </span><strong><span>Filippo Zana</span></strong><span> (Jayco Alula) and </span><strong><span>Ide Schelling</span></strong><span> (Astana Qazaqstan), who</span><span> </span><span>could go for the stage win. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stage 10 winners prediction</strong></h3>\n<p>We think <strong><span>Matthew Riccitello</span></strong> will win the stage.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"608dad43c61c5680f1615e20e8a01b09995b323f10752b37aa8de6197c7256fd","category":"Cycling"}
