{"title":"Get three months of Apple Music free, no purchase necessary, until September 23","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2432325/get-three-months-of-apple-music-free-no-purchase-necessary-until-september-23.html","date":1724175519000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple runs a lot of promotions to give you a few free months of Apple Music, but most of them require you to make a certain purchase. You can get up to six months if you buy new AirPods, Beats, or HomePod products, or if you get the right plan from the right cellular provider. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675739/how-to-get-apple-music-for-free-2.html\">We track all the free Apple Music promotions here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://offers.applemusic.apple/2024-three-month-offer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple has a new promotion</a> for the remainder of the summer that distinguishes itself by requiring no new purchase of any kind. As long as you aren’t a current or former subscriber (and that includes bundles like Apple One), and can activate your subscription on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac with the latest software, you’re good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The promotion gives new subscribers their first three months free and must be redeemed before September 23. Just open the Music app on iPhone, iPad, or Mac and the offer should pop up if you’re not and have not ever been an Apple Music subscriber. If you don’t see the offer, try going to the Home tab, you should see it there.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2432325/get-three-months-of-apple-music-free-no-purchase-necessary-until-september-23.html\" target=\"_blank\">GET APPLE MUSIC FREE FOR 3 months</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5825f6119b0fee913eab0da293beec864b63ad3636cacec04f9f7e38122eb9c8","category":"Apple"}
