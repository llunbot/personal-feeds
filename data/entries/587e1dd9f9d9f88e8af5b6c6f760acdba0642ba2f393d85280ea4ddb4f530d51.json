But Pirelli did a few interesting things to make this a more versatile all-road tire, from size-specific tread patterns, the biggest size range we know of from a road tire, and a construction adapted from gravel tires for all-surface durability. Plus, the made-in-Italy tire is more environmentally friendly than ever, produced from FSC-certified natural rubber and a combined 50+% of bio-based and recycled materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pirelli Cinturato Evo TLR road, all-road &amp; light gravel tire</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pirelli describes the new Cinturato Evo TLR as a “Road Enduro” tire. That mashup might sound quite strange to either road cyclists or mountain bikers. But to motorcyclists, it is completely logical. Based on a tread and large tire volumes heavily inspired by Pirelli’s popular Scorpion Trail III adventure road enduro touring motorcycle tires, the new Cinturato Evo TLR aims to give cyclists the same mixed-surface paved and dirt road capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast rolling slick centerline for smoothness and low rolling-resistance efficiency on tarmac. Soft rubber and increasingly deep &amp; wide tread cutouts on the shoulders for predictable grip on wet, loose &amp; uneven surfaces. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pirelli-Cinturato-Evo-TLR-eco-friendly-enduro-all-road-light-gravel-tubeless-endurance-road-bike-tire_construction.webp\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pirelli-Cinturato-Evo-TLR-eco-friendly-enduro-all-road-light-gravel-tubeless-endurance-road-bike-tire_construction.webp\" alt=\"Pirelli Cinturato Evo TLR eco-friendly tubeless enduro road bike tire, TechWall+ Road casing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pirelli-Cinturato-Evo-TLR-eco-friendly-enduro-all-road-light-gravel-tubeless-endurance-road-bike-tire_construction.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pirelli-Cinturato-Evo-TLR-eco-friendly-enduro-all-road-light-gravel-tubeless-endurance-road-bike-tire_construction-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pirelli-Cinturato-Evo-TLR-eco-friendly-enduro-all-road-light-gravel-tubeless-endurance-road-bike-tire_construction-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pirelli-Cinturato-Evo-TLR-eco-friendly-enduro-all-road-light-gravel-tubeless-endurance-road-bike-tire_construction-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>TechWall+ Road casing</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, big tire widths range from 28-55mm for larger air volume and lower pressures for comfort &amp; grip in any conditions.
