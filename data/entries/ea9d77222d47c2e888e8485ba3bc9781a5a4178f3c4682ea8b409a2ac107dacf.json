There are Evo and GR specs each with an emphasis on different terrain, although the geometry is more road than gravel. The bike has features including a variable setback seatpost design that allows you to fine-tune your ride position for different uses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although we reviewed the gravel spec, we found it a bit twitchy on technical off-road and the 40mm clearance is narrow for gravel. We liked the quality of the frameset though, and reckon that the Evo build would be a better bet than the GR gravel build, as it offers higher gearing from its 2× groupset for faster rides on road. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our full </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/swift-univox-gr-review\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Swift Univox GR review</strong></a></li><li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://pt.swiftbicycles.com/collections/gravel/products/univox-gr-evo\" target=\"_blank\">Swift (€2,890)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fara F/AR</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07102759/fara-far-review-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"fara-far-review-1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07102759/fara-far-review-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07102759/fara-far-review-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07102759/fara-far-review-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07102759/fara-far-review-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07102759/fara-far-review-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07102759/fara-far-review-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07102759/fara-far-review-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07102759/fara-far-review-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07102759/fara-far-review-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Price: From £3,599 (£3,200 as tested)</strong></li><li><strong>Road-going geometry and spec</strong></li><li><strong>Up to 36mm tyre clearance allows you to take in gravel sections on your ride</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A road bike at heart, the Norwegian direct-to-consumer Fara F/AR has the 38mm tyre clearance that allows you to head off for some light gravel action. You can choose the spec to meet your riding aims, whether that be fast group rides or light gravel bikepacking. There are enough hidden mounts to kit the bike out for any adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The geometry is firmly in the endurance road range, but the slightly longer wheelbase and slacker head tube angle add to the tyre clearance and off-road stability. That makes for comfortable, relaxed riding on road but allows you to head off-road mid-route. Although the frame is stiffer than some all-road bikes, the tyre and wheel choice help to temper this.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our full </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fara-far-review\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Fara F/AR review</strong></a></li><li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://faracycling.com/bike-fara-allroad.php\" target=\"_blank\">Fara (£3,559)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mason Definition</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/mason_definition_review_01-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"mason_definition_review_01\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/mason_definition_review_01-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/mason_definition_review_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/mason_definition_review_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/mason_definition_review_01-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/mason_definition_review_01-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/mason_definition_review_01-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/mason_definition_review_01-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/mason_definition_review_01.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Price: £3,665</strong></li><li><strong>Quality Italian-built alloy frameset</strong></li><li><strong>Hits the sweet spot between on-road speed and off-road capabilities</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Mason Cycles was one of the pioneers of all-road bikes and the alloy Definition offers 35mm tyre clearance and a relaxed geometry for on/off road adventures.

We reckon that the geometry is spot-on for an all-road bike as well.

Like the Definition, this is hand built in Italy, in this case from Columbus Spirit and Life tubing. Mason says that it’s chosen steel for its vibration damping and lively ride feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with the Definition, the frame is stiff, but that’s tempered by wider 32mm tyres, with 35mm clearance in the frame. Despite the steel frame, weight is kept down to 8.6kg in our Campagnolo Ekar build, although you can choose an alternative spec to suit your preferences.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our full </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/mason-resolution-review-2\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Mason Resolution review</strong></a></li><li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://masoncycles.cc/shop/categories/resolution-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">Mason Cycles (from £3,265)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vitus Venon Evo RS Ultegra Di2</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"693\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/vitus-venon-evo-review-1-970x693.jpg\" alt=\"Vitus Venon Evo road bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/vitus-venon-evo-review-1-970x693.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/vitus-venon-evo-review-1-300x214.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/vitus-venon-evo-review-1-768x548.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/vitus-venon-evo-review-1-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/vitus-venon-evo-review-1-120x86.jpg 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/vitus-venon-evo-review-1-350x250.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/vitus-venon-evo-review-1-750x536.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/vitus-venon-evo-review-1-1140x814.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/vitus-venon-evo-review-1-190x136.jpg 190w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/vitus-venon-evo-review-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Price: £4.099.99</strong></li><li><strong>Extra-wide 45mm tyre clearance, but with road bike looks</strong></li><li><strong>Wide range of road and off-road configurations available</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vitus Venon Evo is in the vanguard of bikes that are labelled all-road and has the tech to back that up, with very wide 45mm tyre clearance, but also an integrated, aero front end, so that it has the looks of a road race bike but can pack an off-road punch with a change of tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vitus has made the most of this, with a range of specs that includes fast road options labelled RS and wide tyred, single chainring gravel specs labelled GR.

The 9kg weight is competitive for a steel framed bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our build included Shimano Ultegra Di2 and a Chris King headset, which placed it towards the top of the price range, but cheaper builds come in at around £2.5k, which we reckon is good value for such a capable bike.

The tube profiles are now more aero too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also retained from the old model is the down tube cubbyhole for tools or a rescue gel and mudguard mounts. The bar and stem are separate rather than one piece, so you can dial in your fit. Trek offers a large bottom bracket drop that gives a planted feel when cornering and a long trail for stability on descents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The comfort and handling are attractive, but we felt that IsoSpeed was almost superfluous on UK roads and it does contribute significantly to the 8.2kg weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/trek-domane-slr-review\" target=\"_blank\">Trek Domane SLR review</a></strong></li><li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fgb%2Fen_GB%2Fbikes%2Froad-bikes%2Fperformance-road-bikes%2Fdomane%2Fdomane-slr%2Fdomane-slr-7-gen-4%2Fp%2F37059%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Trek (£9,700)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specialized S-Works Roubaix</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/05005150/specialized_s-works_roubaix_2020-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"specialized_s-works_roubaix_2020\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/05005150/specialized_s-works_roubaix_2020-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/05005150/specialized_s-works_roubaix_2020-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/05005150/specialized_s-works_roubaix_2020-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/05005150/specialized_s-works_roubaix_2020-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/05005150/specialized_s-works_roubaix_2020-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/05005150/specialized_s-works_roubaix_2020-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/05005150/specialized_s-works_roubaix_2020-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/05005150/specialized_s-works_roubaix_2020-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/05005150/specialized_s-works_roubaix_2020.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Price: £13,000 (£9,499 as tested)</strong></li><li><strong>Superb ride quality</strong></li><li><strong>Fast ride position is close to the Tarmac</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A spendy option to take onto gravel or pavé, the S-Works Roubaix is nevertheless comfortable and almost as fast as the Tarmac thanks to similar aero profiles, albeit with taller geometry.

But if it’s dry and not too bumpy you can get a long way on a 35mm road tyre run at the lower pressure that this width allows.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Wide, tubeless-compatible rims</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/hunt-25-carbon-gravel-race-6-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Hookless gravel rim\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/hunt-25-carbon-gravel-race-6-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/hunt-25-carbon-gravel-race-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/hunt-25-carbon-gravel-race-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/hunt-25-carbon-gravel-race-6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/hunt-25-carbon-gravel-race-6-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/hunt-25-carbon-gravel-race-6-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/hunt-25-carbon-gravel-race-6-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/hunt-25-carbon-gravel-race-6-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/hunt-25-carbon-gravel-race-6-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/hunt-25-carbon-gravel-race-6.jpg 1600w\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wider tyres perform best on wider rims so pay attention to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-rim-width\" target=\"_blank\">internal rim width</a>. If you’re planning to run 30mm or wider tyres, an internal rim width of at least 21mm is a good choice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many bikes are still sold with inner tubes, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-fit-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">going tubeless</a> is a good idea if you’re venturing off-tarmac. This lets you run lower <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-tyre-pressure\" target=\"_blank\">tyre pressures</a> for comfort and increased grip without risking pinch flats. Any all-road bike worth its salt will come with tubeless-compatible rims, and preferably tubeless-compatible tyres too so you don’t have to spend extra to make the leap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3.

There’s no real consensus about 1× vs. 2× for all-road riding either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands aiming for a gravel aesthetic may opt for the relative simplicity of 1× and it’s easy to see the appeal, but do consider whether you’re getting the actual range of gears your riding demands. For enjoyable riding on- and off-road with nicely spaced gears, 2× still has its place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4.

As well as more stack and less reach, that might mean a slightly longer wheelbase, slightly higher <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-bicycle-head-angle\" target=\"_blank\">trail figure</a> and a slightly slacker head angle than your standard racy road bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>More of a gravel rider?
