Every feature on every product is explained, so you know what each adjustment does and why it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each product pages also links to service manuals, upgrade options, and more. Save the products you own for quicker access next time you need to reference it, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then make notes within the app so you can record how each adjustment feels and make future adjustments based on actual ride impressions, not guesses. This also lets you save your settings for each test lap, so you can go back to your favorite settings for a particular course…or just remember what you changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Support &amp; Kits pages</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rockshox-trailhead-app-2024-update-screenshots-1-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1279\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rockshox-trailhead-app-2024-update-screenshots-1-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Rockshox Trailhead app screenshots showing support info, upgrade kits and parts numbers.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rockshox-trailhead-app-2024-update-screenshots-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rockshox-trailhead-app-2024-update-screenshots-1-297x148.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rockshox-trailhead-app-2024-update-screenshots-1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rockshox-trailhead-app-2024-update-screenshots-1-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rockshox-trailhead-app-2024-update-screenshots-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rockshox-trailhead-app-2024-update-screenshots-1-2048x1023.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The prior <em>Documents</em> section is replaced with <em>Support</em>, where you’ll find all product documents, manuals, etc., plus new service videos, making it easier than ever to find the right tutorial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Kits</em> section shows all service kits, spare parts, etc., for your specific fork or shock model.
