This will be the final edition of this newsletter until January 4â€”hey, space enthusiasts need a holiday break too! And given all that's expected to happen in 2024 in the world of launch, a bit of a recharge seems like a smart move. Stephen and I wish everyone happy holidays and a healthy and prosperous new year.

I hope the list sparks debate, discussion, and appreciation for the challenge of operating a successful rocket company.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992244#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992244&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ac1a28c4e94df6fb44d130a20f0f29017cc0d6b938cfeea3f546c4624a957599","category":"Tech"}
