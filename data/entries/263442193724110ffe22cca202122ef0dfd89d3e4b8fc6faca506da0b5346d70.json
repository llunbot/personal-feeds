The US Department of Justice is taking SpaceX to court over allegations of hiring discrimination, but the government is relying more than ever on SpaceX's technical prowess. Once again, Elon Musk's social media posts are part of the story. This week, we also cover the successes and struggles of small rockets, where Rocket Lab is leading the pack.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

As part of the mission, the launch company reused a previously flown Rutherford engine on its first stage for the first time. In terms of orbital rockets, only NASA's space shuttle and SpaceX's Falcon 9 vehicles have demonstrated the capability of re-flying an engine. With Rutherford, Rocket Lab has now also flown a rocket engine that landed in the ocean for the first time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962918#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962918&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"263442193724110ffe22cca202122ef0dfd89d3e4b8fc6faca506da0b5346d70","category":"Tech"}
