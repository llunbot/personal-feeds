Each book is a look back at the past year of cycling, combining data for all races with features from professional cyclists such as Lotte Kopecky and Josh Tarling with extensive team profiles and essays from those in cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll enjoy reflecting on the 2023 season, from the Tour de France Femmes to Sepp Kuss beating his Jumbo-Visma teammates at the Vuelta a España. It also features ‘In the Winners’ Words’, a piece by Mark Cavendish about winning the final stage of the Giro d’Italia after a stunning leadout from ex-teammate Geraint Thomas. It’s great reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To top it all off, <em>Cyclist</em><strong> </strong>readers can get an exclusive 15% off the 2023 edition, simply enter code <strong>23CYCLIST</strong> at checkout.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://theroadbook.co.uk/collections/road-book-2023/products/the-road-book-2023\" target=\"_blank\">The Road Book (£46.75 with code)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Precision Fuel &amp; Hydration Cramper Hamper</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"920\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/precision_fuel_hydration_cramper_hamper.jpeg\" alt=\"precision_fuel_hydration_cramper_hamper\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/precision_fuel_hydration_cramper_hamper.jpeg 920w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/precision_fuel_hydration_cramper_hamper-300x209.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/precision_fuel_hydration_cramper_hamper-768x534.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/precision_fuel_hydration_cramper_hamper-750x522.jpeg 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The festive Cramper Hamper from Precision Fuel &amp; Hydration is back.

Instead of muffling, the sound simply comes through at a lower volume. These Switch versions of the Loop Earplugs combine three of their available noise reduction levels in one. ‘Engage’ is the first option designed for conversation, allowing low and mid frequencies to pass through. Switching to the middle option of ‘experience’ reduces sound or music across all frequencies for a lower volume. The last option is ‘quiet’, which minimises all frequencies and is the one I have been trialling most especially with builders outside my window.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Loop-Earbuds-2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Loop-Earbuds-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Loop-Earbuds-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Loop-Earbuds-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Loop-Earbuds-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Loop-Earbuds-2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Loop-Earbuds-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Loop-Earbuds-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Loop-Earbuds-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Loop-Earbuds-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Loop-Earbuds-2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They can be used for a variety of experiences, whether to help with noise sensitivity, sleeping or protecting ears at concerts. Loop Earplugs says the noise reduction means they can be beneficial to people with autism and ADHD too. I like that the brand takes the time on its website to explain more about this and discusses potential sensory sensitivities such as loud noises and strong smells.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found them a bit tricky at first (due to my acrylic nails, not the brand) but managed to get the hang of switching out earbud sizes and testing the different settings available. When I go out on the bike I don’t use anything that could limit sounds around me, so on that basis I wouldn’t recommend using them when cycling on busy roads, but in safer environments or on the turbo the ‘Engage’ mode will appeal to many.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loopearplugs.com%2Fproducts%2Fswitch%3Fvariant%3D47329351270735\" target=\"_blank\">Loop Earplugs (£54.95)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p><em><strong>Ad feature</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>UPGRADE YOUR INDOOR SETUP &amp; SAVE £250</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/wattbike-solus-1-970x728.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/wattbike-solus-1-970x728.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/wattbike-solus-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/wattbike-solus-1-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/wattbike-solus-1-750x563.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/wattbike-solus-1-1140x855.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/wattbike-solus-1.jpeg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ride out the winter weather indoors with the ultimate indoor training experience.

The video from the streaming service rounds up your year of listening, revealing your top artists, tracks, genres and podcasts. For that last one, I assume the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/cyclist-magazine-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast</a> is in yours. I love it as it’s so intimate, it’s a window into a stranger’s listening tastes – a view into their headphone-covered world.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"546\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Spotify-Wrapped-2-546x970.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Spotify-Wrapped-2-546x970.jpeg 546w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Spotify-Wrapped-2-169x300.jpeg 169w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Spotify-Wrapped-2-768x1365.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Spotify-Wrapped-2-864x1536.jpeg 864w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Spotify-Wrapped-2-750x1333.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Spotify-Wrapped-2.jpeg 1080w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>After three strong years at the top, Juice WRLD has been dethroned as my most listened to artist <em>(and I know a lot of you just looked around and went, who?). </em>Now, the wonderful SZA sits proudly at the top. Apparently I’m in her top 0.5% of listeners. SZA is followed by Megan Thee Stallion, Lil Uzi Vert, Beyoncé and Ariana Grande. For genres, there’s no surprises that rap is at the top, with pop, rock and trap latino behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s yours?
