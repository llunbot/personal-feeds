On Thursday, he was off the pace in the T1-2 road race, getting hammered by rain at Fuji International Speedway. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was insult to injury after dropping a chain in Tuesday’s time trial, losing him a medal in the finishing straight.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he neared the finish line on Thursday, out of contention for medals again – he finished eighth – you’d forgive him for finishing the race and writing off his Paralympics campaign as a disappointment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he didn’t. On his left as he rode down the finishing straight, he saw a fellow competitor – South African, Toni Mould – riding her trike alongside him, clearly exhausted, a lap behind the field. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jones slowed to ride alongside her, urging her onwards, a massive smile on his face as he encouraged her to the completion of her own race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mould, an athlete who competes with cerebral palsy, is South Africa’s first female para-cyclist, and earlier this year said that through cycling, she had been able to “overcome depressive episodes and isolation” and “create new friendships” and that cycling has “given me a sense of community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The health benefits far outweigh any medals or trophies that I might ever win,” she said. “As someone with a disability, I have to keep my body as active as possible within my abilities and cycling has given me that opportunity.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Toni Mould is the first female Para-cyclist ever to represent South Africa. She is also the most impaired athlete with quadriplegic cerebral palsy and has to fundraise to attend events.

That’s what the Paralympics are about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If I could encourage her up the hill, make her struggle a bit easier, what’s a place? If I come sixth, seven, eighth – who cares?”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/paralympic-tricyclists-deliver-the-feel-good-moment-of-the-games/\">Read More</a>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"8b558d15e8ec6807363cc4f5deed37a70cc84f9d05260e4e8887690ee1e3dff8","category":"Cycling"}
