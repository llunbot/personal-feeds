This comes contrary to a multitude of rumors prior to Apple's event, which suggested that the major efficiency improvements of the A17 Pro chip would bring battery life improvements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to Apple, the approximate battery life of each of iPhone 15 model is as follows:\r<br />\n<ul><li>iPhone 15: 20 hours</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Plus: 26 hours</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro: 23 hours</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 29 hours</li>\r<br />\n</ul>This is exactly the same as the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro Max, and iPhone 14 Pro Max. Of course, it's possible that efficiency improvements may still result in slightly better real-world performance in Apple's latest models, but we won't know until third-party tests are available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 15 models were announced by Apple earlier this week and will be available to pre-order on Friday. The devices are set to launch on September 22.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-battery-capacities-revealed/\">iPhone 15 Battery Capacities Revealed in Regulatory Database</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-battery-capacities-revealed-in-regulatory-database.2401911/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d763c145ef7b6cf42c2056e67468e13cdf227284fe39b5c718a506a7fa1c7b8d","category":"Apple"}
