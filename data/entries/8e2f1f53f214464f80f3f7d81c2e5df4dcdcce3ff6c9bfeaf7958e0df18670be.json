Curiously, the AI experience on this phone may not match what you've seen from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/pixel-9-phones-the-gemini-ai-stuff-reviewed/\">the company's high-end smartphones</a>. Google has confirmed to Ars that the phone's lower memory prevented it from implementing the full suite of Pixel AI features. You can still talk to Gemini by holding the power button or opening the Gemini app, but the on-device Gemini Nano model has seen a downgrade on the 9a.</p>\n<p>Google's approach to AI has changed substantially since the Pixel 8a launched, with some of the Pixel 9's hallmark features relying on local AI processing through the smartphone-optimized Gemini Nano. The Pixel 9a has it, but it's smaller than the Gemini Nano model on other Pixel 9s. For reasons unknown, Google does not call it Gemini Pico—it's Gemini Nano 1.0 XXS (extra extra small). The Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold all run Gemini Nano XS (extra small).</p>\n<p>The Pixel 9a has less RAM than the flagship Pixels, which standardized on 12GB largely to provide Gemini Nano with reserved memory without impeding performance. However, the Pixel 9a still just has 8GB of memory, which is a problem for local AI processing. This is the first Google phone to ship with a new super-small AI model. It saves on resources but can't support some of the best Pixel AI features.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/meager-8gb-of-ram-forces-pixel-9a-to-run-extra-extra-small-gemini-ai/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/meager-8gb-of-ram-forces-pixel-9a-to-run-extra-extra-small-gemini-ai/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8e2f1f53f214464f80f3f7d81c2e5df4dcdcce3ff6c9bfeaf7958e0df18670be","category":"Tech"}
