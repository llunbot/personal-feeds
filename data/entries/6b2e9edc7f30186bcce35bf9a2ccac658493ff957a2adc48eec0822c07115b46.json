The pair built up a gap of over five minutes before Magalhães dropped the Italian in her hunt for Queen of the Mountain points with 32km to go. </span></p>\n<p><span>“I</span><span> </span><span>didn't</span><span> imagine how it would end up. Of course, that was a stage that I was looking for, thinking about the QOM jersey, that maybe if the breakaway had some time </span><span>gap,</span><span> I could have the QOM jersey for at least one day,</span><span>” </span><span>Magalhães explained, speaking to </span><em><span>Rouleur</span></em><span> after stage six.</span><span> “</span><span>But then in the middle, I started believing that I could win</span><span>.”</span></p>\n<p><span>After dropping Missiaggia on the climb, Magalhães fought to hold her gap with the stage win in mind.</span><span> “</span><span>It was like</span><span> '</span><span>oh, there are probably so many WorldTour teams trying to catch me. But </span><span>I'm</span><span> just going to keep my pace, my rhythm, and give everything I can. And if </span><span>that's</span><span> enough to win…</span><span>’ </span><span>I was thinking about that,</span><span>” </span><span>she said.</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>And also thinking: my family</span><span>, probably </span><span>they're</span><span> crazy right now.</span><span> And it was a little bit like maybe I can win, but also </span><span>there's</span><span> so many strong riders out there that can catch me, but I just kept believing</span><span>.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Magalhães </span><span>was caught</span><span> by a charging peloton with 1.8km to go, but had no regrets </span><span>from her day spent out</span><span> in front.</span><span> She also achieved her aim of putting herself into the QOM jersey. </span></p>\n<p><span>“</span><span>T</span><span>hat's</span><span> my way of racing,</span><span>” </span><span>she explained.</span><span> “</span><span>And if the team gives me that freedom, I really like to attack. </span><span>I'm</span><span> much more of a person that attacks than defends</span><span>, you know</span><span>.</span><span>”</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Sure enough, Magalhães was on the attack again a few days later. After a day recovering from her exploits on stage two, the young Brazilian was back on the offensive the next day, jumping on a move from eventual stage winner Clara Emond (EF Education-Cannondale). </span></p>\n<p><span>“I</span><span> </span><span>didn't</span><span> want to go to the breakaway because I was a little </span><span>bit</span><span> tired,</span><span>” </span><span>she said.</span><span> “</span><span>But I saw that Clara was attacking, and I just jumped on her wheel. And we started to try to get the gap to increase. But I </span><span>wasn't</span><span> on my best day. I thought that maybe if I get to the first climb from that stage, I could already get the QOM jersey back, but it </span><span>wasn't</span><span> that day, I </span><span>didn't</span><span> have the legs for that, and Clara was too strong for me that day.</span><span>” </span><span> </span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/tota.jpg?v=1720871970\" /></div>\n<p><span>Magalhães and the rest of the breakaway riders were eventually caught by the peloton while Emond went on to win the stage.</span><span> Although she missed out on a victory, she is pragmatic in her outlook:</span><span> “</span><span>For sure, being in the QOM jersey for one day was a nice feeling that I hope I have more of it. Also, the win </span><span>didn't</span><span> come, but I know someday it will come. So this is stuff </span><span>that I</span><span> think about, and I guess </span><span>it's</span><span> helped me get motivated. But </span><span>I'm</span><span> not in a rush,</span><span>” </span><span>she said. </span></p>\n<p><span>She may not feel any urgency, but her aggressive racing and determination </span><span>are sure to</span><span> have caught the eye of some of the WorldTour teams she knew were chasing her down on stage two. Has she been hoping to step up after this season?</span><span> “</span><span>Yeah, of course, I want that step up, but </span><span>I'm</span><span> not in a rush,</span><span>” </span><span>she said.</span><span> “</span><span>I know that </span><span>I'll</span><span> be there someday, I guess. If I put in the work and do what </span><span>I'm</span><span> doing in one or two </span><span>years</span><span> </span><span>I'll</span><span> be there. I hope so. </span><span>O</span><span>f course, I think about it. And I guess </span><span>it's</span><span> good that I think because then it keeps me motivated.</span><span>” </span></p>\n<p><span>Motivation is not something that the 23-year-old rider lacks. After two stages in the breakaway and a tough race </span><span>so far</span><span>, Magalhães still has her eye on one more possible chance:</span><span> “</span><span>I'm</span><span> praying for my legs,</span><span>” </span><span>she laughs.</span><span> “</span><span>But </span><span>I'm</span><span> looking forward to the last stage. Tomorrow [Saturday] </span><span>is going to</span><span> be a GC stage, but in the last stage, maybe a breakaway can win. </span><span>I'm</span><span> looking</span><span> forward to that. Maybe tomorrow, </span><span>I'll</span><span> keep it easy to see if I can have any opportunity on the last stage.</span><span>” </span></p>\n<p><span>Outside of personal success, Magalhães is motivated by the opportunity to inspire more young Brazilians to take up the sport. The only female Brazilian pro racing in Europe, she hopes to blaze a trail for others. </span></p>\n<p><span>“I</span><span> really try to be myself,</span><span>” </span><span>she said.</span><span> “</span><span>And if </span><span>that's</span><span> enough to inspire the new generation in </span><span>Brazil</span><span> I will be really, really glad to help. Brazil is such a big country </span><span>and</span><span> </span><span>there's</span><span> so much talent there. </span><span>I know,</span><span> right now, Brazil is like a soccer country, but it can also be a cycling country.</span><span> So I hope when </span><span>I'm</span><span> out there, I inspire the new generation to keep believing to try to open new doors for them.</span><span>” </span></p>\n<p><span>Doors that, for Magalhães, were not so easily opened. A former football player, she decided one year to join her </span><span>family’s</span><span> Christmas tradition of cycling to the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, where she is from,</span><span> “</span><span>but my mum said that I needed to train for it,</span><span>” </span><span>she said.</span><span> “</span><span>So I started training and enjoying it </span><span>and</span><span> yeah, here I am right now.</span><span>” </span></p>\n<p><span>Still, after racing gran fondos and amateur races in Brazil, making the step to Europe was a </span><span>difficult</span><span> process for Magalhães:</span><span> “</span><span>I wanted to come to Europe to race here, but I </span><span>didn't</span><span> know how,</span><span>” </span><span>she said.</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>And also Brazil, </span><span>it's</span><span> a little bit...there was some doping background, so they </span><span>don't</span><span> have a good image</span><span>, you know</span><span>.</span><span> So it was a little bit hard.</span><span>” </span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/otlb.jpg?v=1720872150\" /></div>\n<p><span>Eventually, she found </span><span>herself</span><span> a spot on the now-defunct Spanish Continental team, Bizkaia Durango </span><span>for</span><span> 2023. At 22 years </span><span>old</span><span> she moved to Durango and lived in the team house with one other rider,</span><span> “</span><span>I </span><span>didn't</span><span> know how to speak </span><span>Spanish</span><span> so I learned. It was a good experience,</span><span>” </span><span>she said. </span></p>\n<p><span>“O</span><span>f course, it was different because I </span><span>wasn't</span><span> used to it. </span><span>But then I was </span><span>really</span><span> motivated to learn and know how to race </span><span>that</span><span> made it easy.</span><span> </span><span>I think</span><span> I was so happy about the opportunity that I </span><span>didn't</span><span> see the bad things about it, you know, just the good things</span><span>.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Although the team folded at the end of the season, they helped Magalhães find a ride for 2024. No longer living in Durango, Magalhães has based herself in Girona, a move that myriad other cyclists have taken before her.</span><span> “</span><span>They opened the door for me,</span><span>” </span><span>she said of Bizkaia </span><span>Durango</span><span> “</span><span>and </span><span>I'm</span><span> glad </span><span>I'm</span><span> here, living my dream</span><span>.”</span></p>\n<p><span>After the Giro </span><span>d’Italia</span><span> Women, Magalhães will fulfil another dream: to represent Brazil at the Olympic Games in Paris.</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>To represent my country for a big event is something </span><span>that I dream about a lot</span><span>.</span><span> Having</span><span> the opportunity. </span><span>I'm</span><span> </span><span>really glad</span><span>,</span><span>” </span><span>she said.</span><span> “</span><span>I think </span><span>I'll</span><span> just see how this thing is when </span><span>I'm</span><span> there. Day by day, first Giro, then Olympics.</span><span>” </span></p>\n<p><span>Whether </span><span>it’s</span><span> taking on a charging peloton of WorldTour teams, moving countries, learning a new language or representing her nation at the Olympic Games, Magalhães approaches everything with a pragmatic but optimistic outlook. Her plan going forward, she said, is:</span><span> “</span><span>Being in the present, doing your work, and the good thing is that it only depends on me doing my work and enjoying racing and suffering and the rest I hope will come</span><span>.”</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"6b2e9edc7f30186bcce35bf9a2ccac658493ff957a2adc48eec0822c07115b46","category":"Cycling"}
