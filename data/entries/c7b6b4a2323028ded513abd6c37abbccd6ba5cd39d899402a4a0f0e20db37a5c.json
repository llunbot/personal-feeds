The information isn't new, but it does provide a look at all of Apple's ‌M1‌ marketing materials.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌M1‌, Apple explains, offers up to 2x faster Excel performance, 50 percent faster web app responsiveness, and 2x longer battery life when video conferencing on Zoom.<blockquote>When compared with the latest model of the best-selling PC notebook purchased by businesses in its price range, MacBook Air with M1 offers up to 2x faster Excel performance, up to 50% faster web application responsiveness, up to 2x faster browser graphics performance and up to 2x longer battery life when video conferencing with Zoom on a single charge.</blockquote>Apple also highlights the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>'s long battery life, device security, and integration with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> as reasons why the Mac is superior to PCs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBusinesses can set up Macs from anywhere with zero-touch deployment, and Macs are intuitive to use and easy to manage with features like Migration Assistant so companies won't need to rely as much on IT support staff. Apple cites a study that says the Mac is less expensive to run because it needs fewer support tickets and less software, saving businesses up to $843 over a three-year period.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Apple, 84 percent of the \"world's top innovators\" like Salesforce, SAP, and Target run Macs at scale, and business apps \"run beautifully\" on the Mac.
