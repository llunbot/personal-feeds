Most of us consider the late physicist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Teller\">Edward Teller</a> to be the \"father of the hydrogen bomb\"—and Teller did indeed champion the notion of a fusion-based \"super bomb.\" But hardly anyone outside of physics has heard of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Ulam\">Stanislaw Ulam</a>, the Polish mathematician and physicist who helped realize Teller's objective, although the extent of their respective contributions to the breakthrough <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Teller%E2%80%93Ulam_design\">Teller-Ulam design</a> remains both highly classified and controversial.</p>\n<p>Ulam is also the mastermind behind what is known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method\">Monte Carlo method</a> of computation, and along with his Hungarian-born colleague <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann\">John von Neumann</a>, he was a pioneer of early computing technology. He proposed a novel nuclear pulse propulsion method for starships that led to the formation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)\">Project Orion</a> in 1958, with the goal of achieving interplanetary travel. And he was a formidable poker player, as many of his Los Alamos colleagues learned to their detriment.</p>\n<p>The life of this extraordinary yet largely unsung scientist is the focus of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6875374/\"><em>Adventures of a Mathematician</em>,</a> a new film from German director Thor Klein. Klein's thoughtful, haunting film is less a straightforward biopic and more an elegant, impromptu narrative composed out of key events in Ulam's life, set against the backdrop of World War II and its immediate aftermath.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799843#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799843&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f7782a9274746d45ab2010a8cab047130f9338e04214f41b1a17282aa5d1b976","category":"Tech"}
