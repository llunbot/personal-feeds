It would take effect 180 days after it's enacted, requiring anyone who creates or alters a training set not only to list works referenced by the dataset, but also to provide a URL to the dataset within 30 days before the AI system is released to the public. That URL would presumably give creators a way to double-check if their materials have been used and seek any credit or compensation available before the AI tools are in use.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016595#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016595&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"41cef8b653a822e78cc6a573cccdd6cab7ad8b23a69020de23949d03501bd235","category":"Tech"}
