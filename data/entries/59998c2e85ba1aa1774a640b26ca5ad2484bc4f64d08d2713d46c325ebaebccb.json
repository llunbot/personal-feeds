{"title":"Sidenote of the Week: All MacBook Air Models Now Start With 16 GB RAM","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/macbook-air-now-starts-with-16gb-ram/","date":1730324243000,"content":"\n<p>Joe Rossignol, reporting for MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple today in its <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/new-macbook-pro-features-m4-family-of-chips-and-apple-intelligence/\">new MacBook Pro press release</a> announced\nthat the MacBook Air lineup now starts with 16GB of RAM, up from\n8GB previously. This change applies to the 13-inch model with the\nM2 chip, the 13-inch model with the M3 chip, and the 15-inch model\nwith the M3 chip. In the U.S., the MacBook Air lineup continues to\nstart at $999, so there is no price increase associated with the\nboost in RAM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We all know Apple Intelligence has steep memory requirements, which is one factor why it’s only available on iOS devices with 8 GB or more of RAM. But 8 GB of RAM on a Mac is, practically speaking, less than 8 GB of RAM on an iPhone or iPad, because of the profound differences in how memory is managed and application life cycles work on MacOS. On MacOS, every app that looks like it’s running is actually running. And there’s no hard limit on how many apps you can run. Even if your Mac runs out of actual memory, MacOS will use swap files to handle the overflow. iOS doesn’t work that way. iOS freezes apps in the background, freeing up memory — and while M-series-based iPads do support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/08/ipados-16-storage-as-virtual-memory/\">a limited form of virtual memory swap</a>, A-series-based iOS devices (including all iPhones) do not.</p>\n\n<p>Even taking Apple Intelligence out of the equation, Apple’s MacBook lineup was years overdue for a bump in base RAM. A few months ago David Schaub created a graph showing <a href=\"https://mstdn.social/@dschaub/111382154184733138\">the base RAM of Apple laptops on a logarithmic scale since 1999</a>. Today marks only the second time in the Tim Cook era that base Mac RAM went up. (Schaub made <a href=\"https://mstdn.social/@dschaub/111813281624281698\">another graph for Mac desktops</a> that goes all the way back to 1984, and the change in slope during the Cook era is even more striking on that chart.) Base RAM on Macs has been stuck at 8 GB since 2017. Even if you count the architecture transition from Intel x86 to Apple Silicon as a de facto bump in base memory — which is arguably fair, given the performance characteristics of an 8 GB Apple Silicon Mac compared to an 8 GB Intel Mac — Macs were still grossly overdue for a bump in base memory.</p>\n\n<p>So I’m not surprised that Apple took this opportunity to double base RAM in the M3 MacBook Air models. I am quite surprised, though, that they went as far as to double the base RAM even in the entry-level $999 M2 MacBook Air.
