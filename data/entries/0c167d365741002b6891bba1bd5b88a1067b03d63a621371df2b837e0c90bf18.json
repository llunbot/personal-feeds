In 2021, the squad has made starts in four WorldTour events, in addition to making its debut at the Giro Donne. Clara Koppenburg’s fourth-place overall finish at the Vuelta a Burgos has been the team’s best result in top-division races so far this season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rally’s women’s squad has been a UCI-registered team since 2013, when it was known as Optum-Kelly Benefit Strategies. A move up to the WorldTour would require the women’s team to pay minimum salaries to all of its riders, in addition to involving other aspects of increased financial commitment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’ve grown every year since 2007 and this is the next step,” Rally team owner Charles Aaron told VeloNews. “This has been the goal since the formation of the women’s WorldTour.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, there are nine teams racing at the Women’s WorldTour level, but the UCI is hoping to up that total to 15 teams.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/rally-reportedly-planning-to-seek-womens-worldtour-license/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"0c167d365741002b6891bba1bd5b88a1067b03d63a621371df2b837e0c90bf18","category":"Cycling"}
