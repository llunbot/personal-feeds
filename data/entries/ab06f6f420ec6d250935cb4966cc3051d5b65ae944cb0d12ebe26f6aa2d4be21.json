{"title":"PNW Purples Out w/ Polished Prototypes (and a New Bar)","link":"https://bikerumor.com/pnw-purple-dropper-post-concept/","date":1714414925000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PNW-purple-anodized-dropper-seatpost-1536x1152.jpg\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" alt=\"purple anodized PNW loam dropper seatpost\" /></p>\n<p>At the show, they thought it would be fun to have a purple version of their Loam dropper post and see what people thought. Turns out, they liked it a lot, so they’re going to do… something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ll start with an anodized silver that’ll be a little shiny (not high polished), and the stanchion will be a slightly different silver. They’re limited to what colors they can do a hard anodizing in, which is necessary on the sliding part (aka “the stanchion”), but they’ll be close in color. As for the purple, that could come later this year as a very limited edition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not shown, a new Range Dropper lineup is coming this summer (target, June) to consolidate their Ranier and Ridge models. It’ll have a sealed, dual-chamber cartridge (similar to what’s in the Ranier), with 6061 series aluminum to save costs. That lets them come in at just $159, and it’ll have a 200mm travel option. Co-founder Aaron Kerson says that gives them one of the (if not thee) most affordable 200mm droppers on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PNW-mountain-bike-stem.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PNW-mountain-bike-stem-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"PNW purple anodized stem\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PNW-mountain-bike-stem-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PNW-mountain-bike-stem-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PNW-mountain-bike-stem-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PNW-mountain-bike-stem-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PNW-mountain-bike-stem.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They also showed off a new Loam stem. It’s fully CNC’d and will come in 35mm and 31.8mm clamp diameters. Look for 32mm and 40mm lengths, and possibly later a 50mm based on demand. They’ll offer it in black, pewter silver, orange, and purple, MSRP is $99.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pnw-31-8mm-mountain-bike-handlebar.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pnw-31-8mm-mountain-bike-handlebar-1536x1152.jpg\" alt=\"PNW Loam carbon handlebar in new 31.8 clamp diameter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pnw-31-8mm-mountain-bike-handlebar-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pnw-31-8mm-mountain-bike-handlebar-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pnw-31-8mm-mountain-bike-handlebar-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pnw-31-8mm-mountain-bike-handlebar-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pnw-31-8mm-mountain-bike-handlebar.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, they’re launching a 31.8mm version of their Loam carbon riser bar (shown in the middle, 35mm on top). To date, it’s only been available with a 35mm center section, but they’ve gotten enough requests for something smaller that they decided to add it to the lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many riders wanted a narrower diameter to add compliance, they had already tuned their 35mm to have some compliance. So, they simply tuned their new 31.8 bar to also have a similar compliance as the 35mm, giving you the option to ride their compliant carbon bars in whatever stem you already have. Look for these in early May 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.pnwcomponents.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PNWcomponents.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pnw-purple-dropper-post-concept/\">PNW Purples Out w/ Polished Prototypes (and a New Bar)</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ab06f6f420ec6d250935cb4966cc3051d5b65ae944cb0d12ebe26f6aa2d4be21","category":"Cycling"}
