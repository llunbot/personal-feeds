The downside is that the satellites are all released into a basic orbit, and if they want to reach a different altitude or inclination, they have to bring their own propulsion along for the ride.</p>\n<p>This has led to the advent of \"last mile\" services from various companies offering small add-on spacecraft capable of providing in-space propulsion. One of the most intriguing of these is Impulse Space, a company founded two years ago by rocket scientist Tom Mueller, who was a founding employee at SpaceX before leaving in 2020.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983306#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983306&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7adb03022266ed9983183b8bcfc03a1937ab9c45ab6102cede9bf95759a8182f","category":"Tech"}
