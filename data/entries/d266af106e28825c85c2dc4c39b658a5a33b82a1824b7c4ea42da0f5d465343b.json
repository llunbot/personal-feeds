Mark it down as another helmet that youâ€™ll either love or hate â€“ but arenâ€™t all of the best POC lids? It could easily be mistaken for a time trial helmet, but is in fact, much more versatile. And now it will boost your visibility too, in bright EF team colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, the EF Pink edition gets one small construction upgrade, possibly to make it more durable in the day-to-day abuse of a helmet in the pro pelotonâ€¦</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bright Pink POC Procen Air EF Pro Cycling aero helmet</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-bike-helmet_pink-team-replica_side-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-bike-helmet_pink-team-replica_side-scaled.webp\" alt=\"2025 POC Procen Air EF Pro Cycling aero road bike helmet, pink team replica is fast\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-bike-helmet_pink-team-replica_side-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-bike-helmet_pink-team-replica_side-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-bike-helmet_pink-team-replica_side-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-bike-helmet_pink-team-replica_side-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-bike-helmet_pink-team-replica_side-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-bike-helmet_pink-team-replica_side-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-bike-helmet_pink-team-replica_side-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/POC)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Debuted <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/poc-procen-air-mini-aero-road-helmet-makes-you-faster-but-not-full-dark-helmet-a-review/\" target=\"_blank\">last spring</a>, the POC Procen Air is a mashup of an aerodynamic time trial helmet and a more all-rounder aero road racing helmet. It combines a smooth aero shell (that could almost be a TT helmet) with a slickly integrated visor and half-ear covers to decrease aero drag. Then it gets 3 forward-facing vents and generous internal channels to deliver just-enough airflow to keep you from overheating. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, POC tones down the TT inspiration just to the extent that makes it still a viable road riding helmet â€“ or even gravel racing, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Quick Follow Review: How does it feel?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/POC-Procen-Air-mini-aero-road-race-helmet-inspired-by-TT-aerodynamics_aero-is-everything.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/POC-Procen-Air-mini-aero-road-race-helmet-inspired-by-TT-aerodynamics_aero-is-everything.jpg\" alt=\"POC Procen Air mini aero road race helmet inspired by TT aerodynamics, side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/POC-Procen-Air-mini-aero-road-race-helmet-inspired-by-TT-aerodynamics_aero-is-everything.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/POC-Procen-Air-mini-aero-road-race-helmet-inspired-by-TT-aerodynamics_aero-is-everything-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/POC-Procen-Air-mini-aero-road-race-helmet-inspired-by-TT-aerodynamics_aero-is-everything-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/POC-Procen-Air-mini-aero-road-race-helmet-inspired-by-TT-aerodynamics_aero-is-everything-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/POC-Procen-Air-mini-aero-road-race-helmet-inspired-by-TT-aerodynamics_aero-is-everything-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/POC-Procen-Air-mini-aero-road-race-helmet-inspired-by-TT-aerodynamics_aero-is-everything-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/POC-Procen-Air-mini-aero-road-race-helmet-inspired-by-TT-aerodynamics_aero-is-everything-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Iâ€™ve ridden in it quite a lot in the past 10 months, and Iâ€™m quite happy with the Procen Air. But then again, with it on my head, I donâ€™t have to look at it when I ride. ðŸ˜‰</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iâ€™m always hot and sweat year-round, so I was curious how it would handle the heat. Admittedly, the ventilation is only sufficient for me on days under say 18Â°C. Anything hotter than that and I roast, especially with the visor in place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big impact in keeping cool is actually taking that visor off, which I do on almost any ride for any sustained climbing. Itâ€™s super easy to do while riding, and snaps quite securely at the back of your head with its 3 embedded magnets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It really is best for me for autumn to spring riding â€“ and I use it on a mix of road &amp; gravel. The soft ear cowls do a surprising job of quieting wind noise while still letting you fully hear everything that is going on around you. The visor provides great visibility, and interestingly dampens some the feeling of going fast by keeping wind off a large portion of your face. Be aware, you might be going faster than you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-is-my-got-to-cool-to-cold-weather-aero-all-road-helmet_riding-gravel.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-is-my-got-to-cool-to-cold-weather-aero-all-road-helmet_riding-gravel.webp\" alt=\"POC Procen Air aero all-road bike helmet review, winter riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-is-my-got-to-cool-to-cold-weather-aero-all-road-helmet_riding-gravel.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-is-my-got-to-cool-to-cold-weather-aero-all-road-helmet_riding-gravel-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-is-my-got-to-cool-to-cold-weather-aero-all-road-helmet_riding-gravel-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-is-my-got-to-cool-to-cold-weather-aero-all-road-helmet_riding-gravel-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-is-my-got-to-cool-to-cold-weather-aero-all-road-helmet_riding-gravel-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-is-my-got-to-cool-to-cold-weather-aero-all-road-helmet_riding-gravel-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-is-my-got-to-cool-to-cold-weather-aero-all-road-helmet_riding-gravel-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, it also has become my go-to helmet for cold winter rides and even wet rides. Paired with a thin windproof cap, itâ€™s more comfortable than ever to ride on those coldest winter days. Does that mean, I could even be in better shape for the Spring Classics where those aero gains might come in handy?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Whatâ€™s new in the EF Pro Cycling edition?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bright-Pink-POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-helmet_whats-new-with-the-pro-team-replica.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bright-Pink-POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-helmet_whats-new-with-the-pro-team-replica.webp\" alt=\"2025 POC Procen Air EF Pro Cycling aero road bike helmet, pink team replica, new in-mold construction\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bright-Pink-POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-helmet_whats-new-with-the-pro-team-replica.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bright-Pink-POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-helmet_whats-new-with-the-pro-team-replica-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bright-Pink-POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-helmet_whats-new-with-the-pro-team-replica-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bright-Pink-POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-helmet_whats-new-with-the-pro-team-replica-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bright-Pink-POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-helmet_whats-new-with-the-pro-team-replica-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bright-Pink-POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-helmet_whats-new-with-the-pro-team-replica-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bright-Pink-POC-Procen-Air-EF-Pro-Cycling-aero-road-helmet_whats-new-with-the-pro-team-replica-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The big news here is that itâ€™s pink. Thatâ€™s important for both fans of the womenâ€™s &amp; menâ€™s EF pro teams, but also for anyone looking for extra visibility out on the road. The only thing I would change with my own Procen Air is its matte â€˜<em>disappear against a background of asphal</em>tâ€™ black color. POC has always been great with hi-viz AVIP models, but this one never got that treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pink POC Procen Air EF Pro Cycling edition also looks to add one more piece of in-mold plastic to the back. Where air exists at the rear vents, my original Procen Air has exposed EPS. Almost a year later after Iâ€™ve been riding in it, I havenâ€™t seen any foam damage here, but I am pretty careful with road helmets. Likely getting tossed in the back of a World Tour team car is harder on helmets, so a bit of extra protection seems like a perfectly smart update here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than that, this is just like the standard edition, but pinker and a few bucks more expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-aero-road-bike-helmet_X-ray-view.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-aero-road-bike-helmet_X-ray-view.webp\" alt=\"POC Procen Air aero road bike helmet, X-ray view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-aero-road-bike-helmet_X-ray-view.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-aero-road-bike-helmet_X-ray-view-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-aero-road-bike-helmet_X-ray-view-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-aero-road-bike-helmet_X-ray-view-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/POC-Procen-Air-aero-road-bike-helmet_X-ray-view-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>aero road helmet with 3 forward vents &amp;
