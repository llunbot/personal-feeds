If you need a low-cost computer for the basics, this MacBook Air is still a good option for only $199.97 (MSRP $999).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside, this MacBook has a 1.8GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB solid-state drive. That combination is enough for web browsing, note-taking, light photo work, and office productivity. The 13.3-inch display has a 1440×900 resolution, which is sharp enough for documents and video without hammering the battery. You also get Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so you can connect to wireless networks, headphones, and other accessories without hassle. Fully charged, the battery can last up to 12 hours, which gives you plenty of room during busy days when you can’t sit down at an outlet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This unit has a Grade “A/B” refurbished rating, which means it’s fully tested but may have light scuffs or small marks on the case. That’s also why the price is so low. It can update to macOS Monterey, which keeps it compatible with most modern software, though it will not move to newer macOS 26 releases. You also get a MagSafe charger in the box and a limited third-party warranty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shipping is free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, you can get a <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/macbook-air-13-3-inch-8gbram-128gb-mqd32ll-a-mid-2017-refurbished?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-12395&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=apple-macbook-air-2017-13-i5-18ghz-8gb-ram-128gb-ssd-silver-refurbished-2026-02-18&amp;utm_term=SALE-312617\" target=\"_blank\">MacBook Air</a> on sale for $199.97.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sale ends February 22 at 11:59 p.m. PT.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp0.stackassets.com/8e94294913be4e484b9c3a9f55ec5e7be35f7d32/store/66343f8a70f7afd627b36e2bccc844214284f70a8188ca8f2230ab099be8/sale_312617_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple MacBook Air (2017) 13″ i5 1.8GHz 8GB RAM 128GB SSD Silver (Refurbished)<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/macbook-air-13-3-inch-8gbram-128gb-mqd32ll-a-mid-2017-refurbished?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-12395&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=apple-macbook-air-2017-13-i5-18ghz-8gb-ram-128gb-ssd-silver-refurbished&amp;utm_term=SALE-312617\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change</em>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7f7aa021099a3a3155c6514c0bbdafd58b6c150910b2258644c3657357219848","category":"Apple"}
