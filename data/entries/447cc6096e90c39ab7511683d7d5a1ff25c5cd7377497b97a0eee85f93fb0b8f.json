This is Netflix's adaptation of the award-winning <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locke_%26_Key\">comic book series</a> written by Joe Hill and illustrated by Gabe Rodriguez. In our 2020 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/tv-technica-2020-our-favorite-shows-and-binges-in-a-year-of-living-distantly/\">year-end TV roundup</a>, I wrote that the series successfully brought \"the fabled Key House and the darkly fantastical world of the comics to vivid life.\" I've been eager for more of the story—and we'll be getting a lot more, since the series has already been renewed for a third season.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for the first season below.)</strong></p>\n<p>Following the brutal murder of their father, Rendell (Bill Heck, <em>The Alienist</em>), the surviving members of the Locke family—mom Nina (Darby Stanchfield, <em>Scandal</em>) and three children, Tyler (Connor Jessup, <em>Falling Skies</em>), Kinsey (Emilia Jones, <em>Doctor Who</em>), and Bode (Jackson Robert Scott, <em>IT</em> and <em>IT Chapter Two</em>)—arrive at Keyhouse, Rendell's Massachusetts ancestral home. Shortly after arrival, Bode, the youngest sibling, finds a magical key, and then another, and another, each with its own special power. The keys whisper to those who are sensitive to them—and of course, Bode, Tyler, and Kinsey can hear them. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801801#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801801&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"447cc6096e90c39ab7511683d7d5a1ff25c5cd7377497b97a0eee85f93fb0b8f","category":"Tech"}
