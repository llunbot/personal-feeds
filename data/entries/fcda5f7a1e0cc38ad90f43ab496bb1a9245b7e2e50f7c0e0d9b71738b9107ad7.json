If you want in on the Pogi magic, our friends at BikeTiresDirect have <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/search?sale=pogi25&amp;utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">everything you need</a> short of the rainbow stripes, and their wide selection of premium, pro-level equipment will have you looking like the Slovenian superman in no time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_StealPogisStyle_inline.png\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_StealPogisStyle_inline.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_StealPogisStyle_inline.png 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_StealPogisStyle_inline-297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_StealPogisStyle_inline-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_StealPogisStyle_inline-120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_StealPogisStyle_inline-768x768.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/search?sale=pogi25&amp;utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\" target=\"_blank\">SHOP THE LOOK</a>\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n<h2>The Helmet</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take it from the top. For helmets Pogačar wears a premium <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/met-trenta-3k-carbon-mips-helmet?utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">Trenta 3K Carbon lid from MET</a> (BYO hair tuft.) This helmet is as light as they come, features Mips Air for extra comfort and security, and is meticulously wind-tunnel-tested (a common feature of almost everything you’ll see here.) You can grab any colorway that suits your fancy, but for going full Pog we recommend his own signature Black version. You can also go for the <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/met-manta-mips-helmet?utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">streamlined Manta</a>, which Pogačar opts for on flatter, faster parcours.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up, we have to mention the proverbial Pog Force Ones. Tadej rocks DMT shoes made with 3D Knit seamless uppers. These things fit like a glove and look impeccable. The SL carbon soles mean the whole package is absurdly featherweight but still going to provide exceptional power transfer.

This season he’ll be riding the stunning new <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/colnago-y1rs-aero-frameset?utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">Y1Rs</a> aero bike and the immaculate, tried and true <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/colnago-v4rs-ultegra-di2-road-bike?utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">V4Rs</a> for lighter weight racing up the Alps and Pyrenees. Both frames are built up with Shimano’s flagship <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/shimano-dura-ace-di2-r9270-12-speed-groupset?utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">Dura-Ace groupset</a> and <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/shimano-dura-ace-pd-r9100-pedals?utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">pedals</a>. It goes without saying that only the best will do for a bike of this caliber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cockpit will have an <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/enve-ses-aero-pro-one-piece-bar?utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">ENVE one-piece bar and stem</a> that’s as light as it is stiff as it is sleek. They also supply their best-selling <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/enve-ses-45-innerdrive-carbon-disc-brake-wheels?utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">SES 4.5 wheels</a> with the ultimate all-rounder profile—at home on the flats and the hills. The unmistakable tri-logo decals (especially in white) stand out from the bunch when spinning and are perhaps the most recognizable part of the look. Mount up a pair of Continental’s blisteringly fast <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/continental-grand-prix-5000-tt-tr-road-tire?utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">Grand Prix 5000 S TRs</a> (or <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/continental-grand-prix-5000-tt-tr-road-tire?utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">TT TRs</a> for even more speed) and you can start to see the formula for 80km attacks coming together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar’s setup shaves off even more weight with <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/search?list=pogi25&amp;brnd=mn4&amp;utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">Carbon-TI chainrings and rotors</a>, featuring two of the industry’s wonder materials living in durable harmony. And with all that speed he needs to be able to stop on a dime, so he runs <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/absolute-black-graphenpads-disc-brake-pads?utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">Absolute Black Graphene brake pads</a> for the absolute pinnacle of stopping power.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_Stem_inline-1.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_Stem_inline-1-1536x1536.png\" alt=\"Steal Pogi's Style: bike handlebars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_Stem_inline-1-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_Stem_inline-1-297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_Stem_inline-1-120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_Stem_inline-1-768x768.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_Stem_inline-1-2048x2048.png 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Photos: Colnago</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_Wheels_inline.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_Wheels_inline-1536x1536.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_Wheels_inline-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_Wheels_inline-297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_Wheels_inline-120x120.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_Wheels_inline-768x768.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BikeRumor_Wheels_inline-2048x2048.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t tried a 3D-printed saddle yet, you are missing the moment. Team UAE Emirates XRG will be going all 2,000+ miles of this year’s Tour on the ludicrously light and comfortable <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/search?list=pogi25&amp;brnd=mfi&amp;utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">Fizik adaptive saddles</a>. Available in their Antares, Aliante and Argo profiles, the new adaptiveversions create seamless transitions between variable density cushioning zones for a smooth and compliant ride you can feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Tech</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pro riders can be particular and Pogi is no different. Rather than riding with one of <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/search?list=pogi25&amp;brnd=mwb&amp;utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">Wahoo’s flagship model</a> head units, he usually opts for the <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/product/wahoo-fitness-elemnt-roam-v2-gps-computer?utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">ELEMNT Roam</a> out front because, you guessed it, it’s lighter and more aerodynamic. For the top rider in the world, even watt-tracking is optimized to save watts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Accessories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally no look is complete if you don’t accessorize. Since you probably don’t have a team car and domestiques to fetch you water, you’ll need to be self-reliant for hydration. And just like the pros it’s easy to stay hydrated without compromising your flawlessly lightweight build with <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/search?list=pogi25&amp;brnd=mel&amp;utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">Elite bottles and cages</a>. Each 550ml Fly Tex bottle weighs only 54 grams and Leggero carbon cages add just 17 grams each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there it is: <a href=\"https://www.biketiresdirect.com/search?sale=pogi25&amp;utm_source=bikerumor&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=021725_pogi_article\">your guide to putting on the Pogačar for 2025</a>; whether you crave unrivaled performance or just want to show off.
