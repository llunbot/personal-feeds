A similar promise is being made to fiber customers for unplanned outages lasting at least 20 minutes, but only if the customer uses an AT&amp;T-provided gateway.</p>\n<p>The \"AT&amp;T Guarantee\" <a href=\"https://about.att.com/story/2025/guarantee.html\">announced today</a> has caveats that can make it possible for a disruption to not be covered. AT&amp;T says the promised mobile bill credits are \"for wireless downtime lasting 60 minutes or more caused by a single incident impacting 10 or more towers.\"</p>\n<p>The full-day bill credits do not include a prorated amount for the taxes and fees imposed on a monthly bill. The \"bill credit will be calculated using the daily rate customer is charged for wireless service only (excludes taxes, fees, device payments, and any add-on services,\" <a href=\"https://www.att.com/why-att/guarantee/?source=EPcc000000000000U\">AT&amp;T said</a>. If an outage lasts more than 24 hours, a customer will receive another full-day bill credit for each additional day.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/att-promises-bill-credits-for-outages-see-fine-print-many-exceptions-apply/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/att-promises-bill-credits-for-outages-see-fine-print-many-exceptions-apply/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"afa019bcadd795c13cea6cef77771e1fcfd686b1a81bd8bce0db6fa88420c16a","category":"Tech"}
