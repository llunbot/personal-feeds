Rolling on a bike that is much lighter than the race bike I was on last year is a real pleasure. </p>\n<p>'Now I find myself jumping in the local group road ride then taking trails home. It's a lot more enjoyable now with improved handling and a more efficient pedalling response.'</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/11/giant_revolt_advanced_2022_2.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<h2>Giant Revolt 2022: new geometry and adaptable features</h2>\n<p>The brand developed a new frame for the top level Revolt Advanced Pro and paired it with an Advanced SL composite carbon fork to make it 'the lightest Revolt ever produced', apparently saving 200g on its predecessor, while the lower level Advanced models carry over the same frame and fork but save a claimed 160g.</p>\n<p>A wealth of tweaks have been made to the geometry to improve compliance, comfort and efficiency without adding grams.</p>\n<p>Firstly all models have a shorter wheelbase and reduced fork trail for a more responsive feel. However Giant has also included a flip chip on the rear dropouts to enable the user to adjust the wheelbase by 10mm to adapt for the surface, with a shorter setting adding agility and a longer setting enhancing stability on rougher terrain.</p>\n<p>There's also the extra benefit of the longer option allowing for a larger rear tyre to be fitted so you can choose between a 42mm and 53mm cap.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/11/giant_revolt_advanced_2022_flip_chip_dropout.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Reach and head angle have also been changed, with the former now 6mm longer – at 387mm – on a medium size and the latter 1° steeper at 71.5°, and the bottom bracket has been dropped 10mm.</p>\n<p>For added compliance, the frames now have a lower seatstay junction and thinner tubes with the D-Fuse seatpost and handlebars – carbon for the Advanced Pro and aluminium for the Advanced – also working to soak vibrations.</p>\n<p>The Pro models have the very latest D-Fuse SLR that has a -5/+15mm offset option and a hidden clamp to secure it from the seatpost that allows for a claimed 25% more flexing. Giant has also included the option for a round seatpost that will allow riders to use a dropper seatpost mountain bike-style.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/11/giant_revolt_advanced_2022_dropper_post_option.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>All new versions have carbon wheelsets and are set up with tubeless tyres from the jump. They are also all fitted with six water bottle mounts and the frameset comes with an adapter at the seatpost for a rack or mudguard.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/4343/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: the best bikes on the market from under £1,000 to over £10,000</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9790/best-of-the-best-cyclist-s-favourite-gravel-bikes\">Best of the best: Cyclist’s favourite gravel bikes</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/8408/best-road-cycling-tyres-the-best-tyres-for-all-occasions\">Best road bike tyres 2021: 10 of the best tyres for all occasions</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/5719/buyers-guide-best-carbon-wheels\">Buyer's guide: best carbon wheels</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/726/are-wider-tyres-really-faster\">Are wider tyres really faster?</a></div>    </div></div><h2>Giant Revolt 2022 models</h2>\n<h3>Giant Revolt Advanced Pro 0</h3>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/11/giant_revolt_advanced_pro_0_2022.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Price: £4,999</li>\n<li>Groupset: Shimano GRX RX810 Di2 2×11</li>\n<li>Wheels: Giant CXR 1</li>\n<li>Colours: Gloss Dark Red, Grenadine</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Giant Revolt Advanced Pro 1</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Price: £4,299</li>\n<li>Groupset: SRAM Rival eTap AXS 2×12</li>\n<li>Wheels: Giant CXR 1</li>\n<li>Colours: Matte Carbon, Gloss Black</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Giant Revolt Advanced 0</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Price: £3,499</li>\n<li>Groupset: Shimano GRX RX810 2×11</li>\n<li>Wheels: Giant CXR 2</li>\n<li>Colours: Satin Knight Shield</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Giant Revolt Advanced 1</h3>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/11/giant_revolt_advanced_1_2022.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Price: £2,999</li>\n<li>Groupset: SRAM Rival eTap AXS 1×12</li>\n<li>Wheels: Giant P-X2</li>\n<li>Colour: Gloss Phantom Green</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Giant Revolt Advanced 2</h3>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/11/giant_revolt_advanced_2_2022.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Price: £2,399</li>\n<li>Groupset: Shimano GRX RX600 2×11 with Shimano GRX RX400 brakes, Shimano GRX RX810 derailleurs, Shimano 105 cassette, FSA Omega AGX chainset, FSA bottom bracket and KMC chain</li>\n<li>Wheels: Giant P-X2</li>\n<li>Colours: Gloss Starry Night, Chameleon Neptune</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Giant Revolt Advanced 3</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Price: £2,199</li>\n<li>Groupset: Shimano GRX RX400 2×10 with Shimano Tiagra front derailleur and cassette, FSA Omega Adventure chainset and KMC chain</li>\n<li>Wheels: Giant P-X2</li>\n<li>Colours: Satin Terracotta</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information visit <a href=\"https://www.giant-bicycles.com/gb/bikes/cross-and-gravel-bikes/gravel\" target=\"_blank\">giant-bicycles.com</a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/cyclocross-gravel-and-adventure\">Cyclocross, gravel and adventure</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f4338c3ab0ff49c0bf2c4f9cae214e765aff4af541cd0a54640eaf4bedbec30d","category":"Cycling"}
