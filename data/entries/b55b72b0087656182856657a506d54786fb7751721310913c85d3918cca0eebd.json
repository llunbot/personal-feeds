{"title":"Jeff Bezos: ‘The Hard Truth: Americans Don’t Trust the News Media’","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/28/jeff-bezos-washington-post-trust/","date":1730162275000,"content":"\n<p>Jeff Bezos, in an op-ed in his Washington Post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an\nelection. No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say,\n“I’m going with Newspaper A’s endorsement.” None. What\npresidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of\nbias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a\nprincipled decision, and it’s the right one. Eugene Meyer,\npublisher of The Washington Post from 1933 to 1946, thought the\nsame, and he was right. By itself, declining to endorse\npresidential candidates is not enough to move us very far up the\ntrust scale, but it’s a meaningful step in the right direction. I\nwish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment\nfurther from the election and the emotions around it. That was\ninadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bezos has always been a good writer, and this piece is no exception. But deciding to change the Post’s policy on election endorsements <em>12 days</em> before any election, let alone <em>this</em> election, is not “inadequate planning”. Changing the policy, say, this summer, before the Republican National Convention, would be “inadequate planning”. Now though? No.</p>\n\n<p>And as regards trust: declining to endorse a candidate won’t “tip the scales” an iota for Trump supporters who view The Washington Post as “fake news”. All it has done is wipe out large amounts of trust among reader who do — or at least until last week <em>did</em> — put their faith in the publication.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/28/bezos-trust\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b55b72b0087656182856657a506d54786fb7751721310913c85d3918cca0eebd","category":"Tech"}
