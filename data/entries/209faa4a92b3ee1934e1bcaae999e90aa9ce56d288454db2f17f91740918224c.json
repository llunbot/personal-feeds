The concept is simple, by lighting up the ends of your bars, motorists can better see cyclists at night when approaching from all directions. And since SideLights includes a pair of bright headlights (600-lumen <em>combined</em>) set wide at the ends of your handlebar, drivers are more likely to see you coming, and better able to judge your approaching speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SideLights bright cycling lights in your handlebar ends</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-offer-360-degree-visibility-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-offer-360-degree-visibility-jpg.webp\" alt=\"SideLights cycling lights in handlebar ends offer 360-degree visibility\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-offer-360-degree-visibility-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-offer-360-degree-visibility-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-offer-360-degree-visibility-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-offer-360-degree-visibility-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-offer-360-degree-visibility-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/SideLights)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dreamed up by Swiss “BMX enthusiast and commuter cyclist” Arthur Claessens, and brother of Olympic BMX-medalist Zoé Claessens, SideLights was created with the singular goal of improving bicyclist safety by making them more visible to motorists.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_rednering-in-bar-ends-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_rednering-in-bar-ends-jpg.webp\" alt=\"SideLights cycling lights in handlebar ends offer 360-degree visibility, rendering\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_rednering-in-bar-ends-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_rednering-in-bar-ends-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_rednering-in-bar-ends-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_rednering-in-bar-ends-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_rednering-in-bar-ends-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_rednering-in-bar-ends-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_rednering-in-bar-ends-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Claessens’ patent-pending solution puts a multi-functional set of lights in each end of your handlebar to ensure 360° visibility. Facing forward is an adjustable angle 300lm headlight under each end of your grips. Facing back is a 100lm taillight. And emanating from the side is a 100lm side indicator with turn signals that are activated by pressing down on a large button with the palm of your hand, without having to really take your hand off the bar. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility-jpg.webp\" alt=\"SideLights cycling lights in handlebar ends offer 360-degree visibility\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By mounting to the bike by sliding into the open end of your bar, the SideLights extend out just a few centimeters beyond your regular grips, but can offer full 360° visibility. It also lights the outer edges of the bike, so passing motorists are more likely to better understand the width of the cyclist, and  then to also pass at a safer distance away from the rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since the lights are set wide apart, they help drivers see you coming in an environment where they are expecting to see horizontal pairs of headlights, like on other cars. This set-apart arrangement also helps others more accurately estimate a cyclists approaching speed, improving safety all-around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>As a regular cyclist, I wanted a product that was easy to use, efficient and, above all, safe for everyday rides,</em>” explains Arthur Claessens.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_installed-but-off-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_installed-but-off-jpg.webp\" alt=\"SideLights cycling lights in handlebar ends offer 360-degree visibility, power off\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_installed-but-off-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_installed-but-off-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_installed-but-off-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_installed-but-off-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_installed-but-off-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_installed-but-off-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SideLights-cycling-lights-in-your-handlebar-ends-for-360-degree-visibility_installed-but-off-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>each SideLight is 52x32x180mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>aluminum main body with bar end bump protectors &amp;
