While there are rules of averages, trail conditions dictate specific needs from a tyre’s performance.</p>\n<p>Secondly, tread patterns need to come in different compounds.</p>\n<p>An aggressive tyre is virtually worthless if its compound feels closer to plastic than soft rubber.</p>\n<p>But ultra-soft tyres will wear out quickly on the rear, especially in drier conditions. While grip is a priority on the front, rolling speed and wear life are considerations at the back. Brands need to offer their tyres in multiple states of stickiness.</p>\n<p>Similarly, XC race tyres are designed for speed, mostly ruling out the need for ultra-tacky compounds, but with XC courses becoming more technical extra grip is in demand.</p>\n<p>Add downcountry into the mix – where outright speed isn’t the single priority – and the rubber tree needs even more branches of possible compounds and treads.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"2023 RockShox Lyrik Ultimate and Super Deluxe Coil Ultimate mountain bike suspension fitted to a Marin Alpine Trail XR mountain bike ridden by Alex Evans\" title=\"2023 RockShox Lyrik Ultimate and Super Deluxe Coil Ultimate mountain bike suspension fitted to a Marin Alpine Trail XR mountain bike ridden by Alex Evans 6\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Decent tyres can help you ride harder and faster… you’ve just got to know which ones to buy.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>Thirdly, carcasses complicate the recipe.</p>\n<p>Downcountry or trail riders on gnarly terrain want the advantages of less aggressive treads, such as high rolling speeds, but the puncture protection of tougher carcasses.</p>\n<p>Now, brands have to deliver their speedy tyres with more casing options.</p>\n<p>Similarly, riders who don’t tackle the most demanding terrain, but perhaps ride in a lot of mud, need aggressive treads usually reserved for enduro or DH, but with a lighter-weight casing, compounding complications.</p>\n<p>This multiplier effect of needs – that’s increasing exponentially with added MTB sub-genres and rider demands – means brands have to make their most popular tread patterns in almost every carcass variation and compound.</p>\n<p>This explains the seemingly impenetrable matrix of tread pattern, compound and carcass types. Understanding them isn’t made any easier by their brand-specific naming structures.</p>\n<p>A first step to help consumers could be naming their tyres after the conditions they’re intended to excel in; a mud tyre would be called, unsurprisingly, ‘Mud Tyre’.</p>\n<p>But then again, the gratification of knowing exactly what a High Roller, Tacky Chan or Minion is designed for might be worth the headache.</p>\n<h2>Tom Law: I want my holy grail – speed AND soft compounds</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tom Law riding Marin mountain bike down trail in Forest of Dean.\" title=\"AL_MBUK_5723031\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> XC tyres satisfy Tom’s speed requirements but undermine his confidence in bends.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As BikeRadar’s resident purveyor of all things downcountry, I often find myself in a weird tyre conundrum.</p>\n<p>I adore these short-travel rippers for their spirited mix of speed, fun and capability.

There are XC, Trail, Enduro and DH casings. This seems more logical than Maxxis’ EXO, EXO+, DD and DH notations.</p>\n<p>Schwalbe almost has it dialled, too, with its SuperTrail, SuperGravity and SuperDH casings. If you ignore the ‘Super’, you’ve pretty much got Trail, Enduro and DH casings.</p>\n<p>Would choosing a new tyre be better for consumers if tyres were sold, for example, as a Specialized Mixed Terrain front, Trail casing, SuperSoft compound, or a Michelin Dry Terrain rear, Enduro casing, Soft compound?
