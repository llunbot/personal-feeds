For context, the full carbon sole on the pro-level Fizik Vento Infinito Carbon 2 is rated 10/10.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The sole of the new Omna is shared with the Vento Infinito.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Fizik says the Vento Omna’s cleat bolt holes are positioned relatively far back to improve pedalling efficiency and reduce knee compression.</p>\n<p>A patchwork of vents are situated at the top right of the sole. Fizik adds that the mesh-like holes in the Microtex upper also aid airflow to the feet.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The shoe is secure with a single Boa dial.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Vento Omna uses a unidirectional, single Boa dial as seen on the brand’s more expensive shoes, such as the Infinito series and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/fizik-tempo-decos-carbon-review/\">Fizik Tempo Decos Carbon</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Fizik Omna will replace the R5 Overcurve.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>It loses the Velcro toe strap from its predecessor, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/fizik-r5-tempo-overcurve-road-shoe-review/\">Fizik R5 Overcurve</a>, and its fit is claimed to be more generous.</p>\n<p>The Fizik Vento Omna has a moulded heel lug, a feature that can stop <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-cycling-shoes/\">road cycling shoes</a> from slipping up and down on the heel. Heel lugs can also be replaceable but we’re not yet sure if that’s the case on the Vento Omna.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The heel bumper is larger than that on the R5 Overcurve.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Fizik claims the Vento Omna weighs 238g per shoe in an unspecified size. Sizing runs through from EU 36-48 with half sizes from EU 37-47. A wide-fit option isn’t currently available, but Fizik says it’s coming soon.</p>\n<p>Available colours are blue, white, black, metallic cherry, red and gun metal.</p>\n<p>We’ll bring you more news from the Cycle Show as soon as we can.
