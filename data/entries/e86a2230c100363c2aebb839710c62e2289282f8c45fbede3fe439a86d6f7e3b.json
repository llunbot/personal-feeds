{"title":"Starfield’s missing Nvidia DLSS support has been added by a free mod","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965508","date":1693941765000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p>A video from modder PureDark shows off the performance benefits of DLSS3 in the Patreon-only version of his mod. </p></div>\n<p>Nvidia graphics card owners can rest easy; <em>Starfield</em> modders have already added support for Nvidia's Deep Learning Super-Sampling (DLSS) technology (alongside the game's official support for AMD's FSR2 upscaling). But unlocking the full power of that mod will require either paying for a Patreon subscription or using cracks to get around some controversial DRM protecting the most full-featured version of the mod.</p>\n<p>Since its initial release on Friday, the <a href=\"https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/111\">\"Starfield Upscaler\"</a> is currently <a href=\"https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield?tab=popular+%2830+days%29\">the most popular <em>Starfield</em> mod listed</a> on clearinghouse NexusMods. That should be welcome news to a <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam\">significant portion of the PC gaming community</a> running a newer Nvidia GPU that supports the frame-rate-enhancing upscaling technology. That's especially true for the Nvidia owners who were outraged when <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/starfield-pc-amd-nvidia-dlss-xess-fsr-framerate-specs-1850583521\">Bethesda announced an official <em>Starfield</em> partnership with AMD this summer.</a></p>\n<p>In practice, though, the practical effect of that DLSS support might be hard to notice for many players. In Ars' testing on a GTX 2080 Ti gaming rig (running at 2560×1440 resolution, Ultra quality, and 50 percent render resolution), we were able to hit 35 frames per second using both the DLSS mod and the game's built-in AMD FSR2 support (which also works on Nvidia cards). Neither upscaling technology had an apparent performance edge, even as both improved significantly on the ~25 fps frame rate when running at full resolution without any upscaling (and even as DLSS has shown <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2RR2770H8E\">superior visual quality in other tests</a>).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965508#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965508&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e86a2230c100363c2aebb839710c62e2289282f8c45fbede3fe439a86d6f7e3b","category":"Tech"}
