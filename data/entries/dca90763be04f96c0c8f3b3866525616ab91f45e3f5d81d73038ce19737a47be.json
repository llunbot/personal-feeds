Since the Apple Watch’s initial debut a decade ago, the iPhone maker has been introducing fresh models annually, which feature enhanced capabilities and occasional design tweaks. On paper, the latest <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2460345/apple-watch-series-10-review-roundup.html\">Apple Watch Series 10</a> is the sleekest, most advanced iteration yet, offering larger screens and new capabilities. However, a closer look exposes why that’s not actually the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A downgraded design in disguise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Glowtime keynote, a lengthy portion of the Apple Watch section revolved around the Series 10’s <em>all-new design</em>. With this release, Apple has made its wearable even slimmer, which, in theory, is a welcome design upgrade. Having worn both the Apple Watch Series 9 and Series 10 on the same wrist, however, I can assure you that the difference isn’t of significance. Sure, you can tell them apart when they’re placed side by side, but it’s far from being a revolutionary overhaul like the Mac mini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Apple has resorted to optical illusions on its website to make the Series 10 appear slimmer than it actually is. The company is taking advantage of the jet black model’s reflective exterior and placing it against white backgrounds in marketing shots, which exaggerates how thin the device is. Had the smartwatch been meaningfully thinner, Apple wouldn’t need to rely on trickery to sell it—instead, it would confidently present it as it is.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-charging-coil.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch Series 10 underside\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-charging-coil.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-charging-coil.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-charging-coil.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-charging-coil.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-charging-coil.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-charging-coil.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-charging-coil.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The Apple Watch Series 10 looks thinner in renders than it does in real life.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And, despite Apple dedicating a large chunk of the presentation to boast about the improved design, it casually disregarded one major downgrade in this department. The Apple Watch Series 10, compared to the Series 7, 8, and 9, has noticeably thicker screen bezels. Given that users spend most of their time looking at the watch face (and not how slim its body is), the Series 10 arguably appears a bit more dated than its predecessors where it matters. Plus it’s bigger by about a millimeter all around making the whole package feel less svelte than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, Apple has discontinued the red finish, which was the most vibrant option. So, users are now limited to fewer and duller colors. And while glossy enthusiasts will appreciate the new jet black model, Apple isn’t offering a matte black variant for those who don’t want their watches to show scratches as easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Health features that are so 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With every new Apple Watch launch, the firm typically reveals at least one new health-related feature—and 2024’s edition was no different. During the keynote, Apple announced that sleep apnea detection is debuting with watchOS 11. Well, except that it’s not exclusive to the Apple Watch Series 10, with support extending to last year’s Series 9 and Ultra 2. So, by buying the Apple Watch Series 10, you’re not getting any exclusive health features unavailable on previous models.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Sleep-Apnea.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"03 Apple Watch Series 9 Sleep Apnea\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Sleep-Apnea.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Sleep-Apnea.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Sleep-Apnea.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Sleep-Apnea.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Sleep-Apnea.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Sleep-Apnea.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Sleep-Apnea.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/03-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Sleep-Apnea.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The Apple Watch Series 10’s new sleep apnea detection is also coming to Series 9.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, the blood-oxygen monitor on the Series 10 continues to be inactive in the U.S. due to a patent dispute. While Apple may enable it through a future software update at any time, no relevant rumors or official announcements suggest that’s happening anytime soon. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch Series 9 offers blood-oxygen monitoring in the U.S. if the model number doesn’t end with <em>LW/A</em>. So, if you come across an older, pre-ban Series 9 unit, grab it as it’ll offer you more health data than the latest Series 10.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond that, the Apple Watch Series 10 packs a depth gauge that can handle no more than 6 meters of water. Meanwhile, the Ultra 2 variant supports up to 40 meters. So, while the Series 10 caters to casual divers more than the Series 9, any serious watersport athlete would probably find its 6-meter limit laughable and opt for the Ultra 2 instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Repackaged, year-old performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In an era where smartwatches have become mini phones, the processor matters more than ever. In typical Apple fashion, though, the Series 10 doesn’t offer any performance boosts. The S10 chip that powers 2024’s model is seeingly just a repackaged S9 from last year’s release. Consequently, you get the same set of features, such as the double-tap gesture, on-device Siri with access to health data, RAM, storage capacities, etc.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/02-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Idle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"02 Apple Watch Series 9 Idle\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/02-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Idle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/02-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Idle.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/02-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Idle.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/02-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Idle.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/02-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Idle.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/02-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Idle.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/02-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Idle.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/02-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Idle.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>While the design is slightly different, many of the specs and features of the Apple Watch Series 10 are the same as last year’s model.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the battery life—according to Apple’s own claims—remains unchanged with the Series 10. The watch, however, does charge from 0 to 80 percent in 30 minutes instead of 45 minutes—when using a 20W or higher charger (Apple doesn’t supply one). Furthermore, the speaker now supports direct music and podcast playback, which had been exclusive to the Ultra model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Apple Watch Series 10 undoubtedly brings some small improvements to the table, they’re unlikely to impact most users’ daily lives. I’ve yet to come across someone who’s looking to play music through their smartwatch’s speaker or cares that much about spending 15 minutes less when topping up its battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Not the time to buy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 10 is a very good smartwatch. But so is the Series 9. Future models will likely maintain the thinner build while managing to thin down the chunky display bezels, possibly as early as next year. Until then, I personally think the overall look of the Series 9 is the epitome of Apple Watch design.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/01-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Worn.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"01 Apple Watch Series 9 Worn\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/01-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Worn.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/01-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Worn.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/01-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Worn.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/01-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Worn.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/01-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Worn.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/01-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Worn.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/01-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Worn.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/01-Apple-Watch-Series-9-Worn.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>If you can find an Apple Watch Series 9 on clearance, grab one.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, both the Series 9 and Series 10 offer the same performance, battery life, and health features—including the latest sleep apnea detection. In fact, the Series 9, in some instances, exclusively offers blood-oxygen monitoring in the US, which 2024’s edition completely misses out on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking all of the above into consideration, you should probably skip the Series 10 this year. If you really want a new Apple Watch, consider picking up a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Resistant/dp/B0CSTFHP3W/\">cheaper Apple Watch Series 9 on clearance</a>. Otherwise, you’re better off getting last year’s model or waiting for the Series 11. </p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"dca90763be04f96c0c8f3b3866525616ab91f45e3f5d81d73038ce19737a47be","category":"Apple"}
