{"title":"Jon Prosser on Marques Brownlee","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLRdnXsNT08","date":1690562111000,"content":"\n<p>Lovely, heartfelt salute to MKBHD from Jon “Front Page Tech” Prosser. Brownlee is so good at what he does, it almost defies description. His reviews are fair, deeply informed, and fun to watch. His taste is exquisite. He’s a dynamic, compelling presence on screen. He’s incredibly prolific yet always leaves you wanting more. The production values of his videos push the envelope of the state of the art: they look and sound (including the music) better than anything else on YouTube, and top YouTubers long ago surpassed broadcast TV in this regard. He’s simultaneously an expert pundit, worldwide on-camera star, and talented filmmaker.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/28/prosser-mkbhd\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9bd5528a148d8cc3cf78664ffea749676684dd50653e381a92534c8902d677a8","category":"Tech"}
