While that did not happen, the new ‌AirPods‌ are rumored to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/15/third-generation-airpods-shipments/\">already be in mass production</a>, and Apple is seemingly gearing up to launch them before the end of the year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new ‌AirPods‌ will be the first significant update to the ‌AirPods‌ lineup since the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> three years ago. The new ‌AirPods‌ are expected to feature an updated design that takes inspiration from the higher-end ‌AirPods Pro‌ but lacking in \"Pro\" features. Rumors are unclear on whether the new ‌AirPods‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/21/next-gen-airpods-image-leak/\">will feature silicone ear tips</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/10/leaked-renders-for-third-gen-airpods/\">not</a>, as leaked images and renders depict both possibilities.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple announced its ‌AirPods Pro‌ via a press release in 2019, and besides their initial announcement on stage in 2016, ‌AirPods‌ have not yet been given dedicated airtime during an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple event</a>. Apple could announce the new third-generation ‌AirPods‌ via a press release in the coming weeks, or alternatively include them in its rumored second event for the fall, expected to take place later this month or in November. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/\">AirPods 3</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/01/third-generation-airpods-on-track-for-2021-launch/\">Third-Generation AirPods Still Rumored to Be on Track for 2021 Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/third-generation-airpods-still-rumored-to-be-on-track-for-2021-launch.2314801/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cv3523Sj-UI:Ars0tkaK_7U:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cv3523Sj-UI:Ars0tkaK_7U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/cv3523Sj-UI\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"43f474062ef84eb7b8eb0859c8ee0839f6c315fff3aea135107a80676996a48d","category":"Apple"}
