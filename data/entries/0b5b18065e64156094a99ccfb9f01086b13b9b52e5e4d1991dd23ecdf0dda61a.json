The free app was launched on iOS in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/12/apple-releases-itunes-movie-trailers-app-for-ios/\">October 2011</a> in the U.S., offering iPhone and iPad users easy access to Apple's library of movie trailers. Closing the app is likely part of Apple's strategy to gradually wind down the iTunes branding and bring all of its video content under the same umbrella. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's not entirely clear what this means for Apple's <a href=\"https://trailers.apple.com\">iTunes Movie Trailers website</a>, which is still sporting some archaic interface elements that don't at all align with Apple's modern web design. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/itunes-movie-trailers-website.jpg\" alt width=\"2390\" height=\"1332\" />\r<br />\nThe site has been hosted on apple.com since the late 1990s and was originally titled \"<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20021008191614/http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/\">Quicktime Movie Trailers,</a>\" to showcase Apple's QuickTime software and its ability to host downloadable movie trailers online at high resolution – higher than many Hollywood movie studios could achieve – in the days before YouTube.  <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/itunes/\">iTunes</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-apps.2\">Mac Apps</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/11/apple-to-sunset-itunes-movie-trailers-app/\">Apple to Sunset iTunes Movie Trailers App, Roll into TV App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-sunset-itunes-movie-trailers-app-roll-into-tv-app.2398344/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0b5b18065e64156094a99ccfb9f01086b13b9b52e5e4d1991dd23ecdf0dda61a","category":"Apple"}
