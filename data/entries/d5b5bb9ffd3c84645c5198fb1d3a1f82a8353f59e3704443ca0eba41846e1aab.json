The Pixel 8 Pro tops out \nat 12GB. </p>\n\n<p>Anything could change between prototype and product, especially \nfor RAM, which is usually scaled up and down in various phone \ntiers. A jump in RAM is something we were expecting though. As \npart of Google’s new AI-focused era, it wants generative AI models \nturned on 24/7 for some use cases. Google said as much in a recent \n<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/google-says-the-pixel-8-will-get-its-new-ai-model-but-ram-usage-is-a-concern/\">in-house podcast</a>, pointing to some features like a new \nversion of Smart Reply built right into the keyboard, which \n“requires the models to be RAM-resident” — in other words, loaded \nall the time. Google’s desire to keep generative AI models in \nmemory means less RAM for your operating system to actually do \noperating system things, and one solution to that is to just add \nmore RAM. So how much RAM is enough? At one point Google said the \nsmaller Pixel 8’s 8GB of RAM was too much of a “<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/google-says-the-ai-focused-pixel-8-cant-run-its-latest-smartphone-ai-models/\">hardware \nlimitation</a>” for this approach. Google PR also recently \ntold us the company still hasn’t enabled generative AI smart reply \non Pixel 8 Pro by default with its 12GB of RAM, so expect these \nRAM numbers to start shooting up. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That last link is to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/google-says-the-ai-focused-pixel-8-cant-run-its-latest-smartphone-ai-models/\">a story positing</a> that Google’s Gemini Nano runs on the Pixel 8 Pro but not the regular Pixel because the Pro has more RAM (12 vs. 8 GB).</p>\n\n<p>Comparing iPhone RAM to Android RAM has never been apples-to-apples (same goes for battery capacity), but still, it’s hard not to wonder whether Apple’s on-device AI plans are hamstrung by the relatively stingy amounts of RAM on iPhones. <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/18/iphone-ram-list/\">Here’s a list from 9to5Mac</a> showing the RAM in each iPhone going back to the original (which had just 128 MB!). iOS 17 supports models dating back to 2018’s iPhone XS and XR (4 and 3 GB of RAM, respectively). If iOS 18 drops those models, the new baseline will be the iPhones 11 and 11 Pro, which all sport 4 GB. The most RAM on any iPhone to date is 8 GB in the 15 Pro models, but 8 GB is what Google deemed insufficient for the Pixel 8 to run Gemini Nano.</p>\n\n<p>Might some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-working-on-on-device-llm/\">iOS 18 on-device AI features</a> be limited to newer models with more RAM?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/22/on-device-ai-craves-ram\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d5b5bb9ffd3c84645c5198fb1d3a1f82a8353f59e3704443ca0eba41846e1aab","category":"Tech"}
