Prices for the limited-edition model will start at £8,999/€9,499.</p>\n<p>All models are available with either 625Wh or 750Wh batteries, with the larger-capacity battery adding an extra £200/€200 to the bike’s price.</p>\n<p>The Strive:ON is available now to order in Europe, with bikes arriving on US shores later in the summer. Canyon has yet to confirm an exact date or US pricing.</p>\n<h2>Carbon frame and a moto-stye skidplate</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Strive:ON uses the same sealed bearings as the Sender DH bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>The Strive:ON features a full carbon fibre frame that Canyon say uses the same carbon layup as the top-tier Strive CFR and weighs in at 3,268g for a size medium, including all assembly parts.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">Horst-link suspension linkage</a> is still used, similar to that on the non-assisted Strive, but the shock is now horizontally mounted to leave room for the motor, top tube storage and a bottle cage.</p>\n<p>Canyon hasn’t included the Shapeshifter system found on the Strive. The Shapeshifter system uses a Fox-built air piston in the shock mount, which alters the damper’s position, giving the bike two geometry and travel settings for pedal efficiency and downhill ability.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bosch’s Performance Line motors offer 85Nm of torque and a maximum of 600 watts of power.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The bike has been designed around Bosch’s Performance Line motors and also uses the brand’s PowerTube batteries.</p>\n<p>Canyon offers the bike with a 625Wh or 750Wh battery pack on all frame sizes, with the brand wanting to give riders the option of a lighter bike or a longer range.</p>\n<p>The motor and battery terminal are protected by a moto-inspired skidplate, allowing the bike to ground out on technical terrain without damaging the frame or motor, according to Canyon.</p>\n<p>Magnets feature on the inside of the guard to hold the retaining bolts when changing the battery, so you don’t lose them.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title

Strive:ON line-up feature <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/coil-vs-air/\">air shocks</a>, Canyon says the new bike is compatible with a coil shock.</p>\n<p>Coil shocks are becoming more common on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-mountain-bikes/\">electric mountain bikes</a>, because the weight penalty is less of an issue when you have a motor to assist on the climbs.</p>\n<p>All the bikes in the Strive:ON line-up feature a 170mm fork, with Canyon saying the bike is not dual-crown compatible, because the wide down tube that houses the battery would cause the fork to interfere with the steering angle.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The top tube has bolts for mounting various storage.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The underside of the top tube has bolts for on-bike storage systems such as a tube or multi-tool holder, while the forks will feature Canyon’s new screw-on fenders that mount directly to RockShock Zeb and Fox 38 forks.</p>\n<h2>Long reach and a mixed wheel size</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Canyon says the 27.5in rear wheel improves acceleration and agility through tight trails</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Canyon says it has updated the Strive:ON’s geometry compared to the non-assisted Strive, adapting the bike to meet the demands of e-enduro racing, which combines downhill trails with technical climbing stages.</p>\n<p>The Strive:ON has a claimed head angle of 63.5 degrees, which is up-to-date with current geometry trends for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">enduro bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>A reach measurement of 475mm for a medium-sized bike makes it longer than other bikes in its class, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-orbea-wild/\">Orbea Wild</a>, which has a 450mm reach for a similar-sized frame.</p>\n<div>\n

This is around two degrees steeper than the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-specialized-turbo-levo-sl-ii/\">Specialized Turbo Levo</a>.</p>\n<p>Chainstay measurements are short at 445mm, with the bike using a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-faster-mullet-bike-29er/\">mixed wheel size mullet setup</a>.
