That’s a savings of $50 you can put towards something else you’ve been waiting to buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are about a million things you can do with your new tablet, starting with streaming all your favorite shows and movies. The 11-inch Liquid Retina Display will ensure you’ll get gorgeous images in vivid color. It also comes with 128GB of storage space—twice that of the previous model. Considering how large some apps and games are, that’s a welcome change across iPads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2646985/ipad-a16-review.html\">gave the new iPad a 4-star rating</a>, appreciating just how bright the screen is, as well as the overall high-quality design and workmanship of the tablet. Even though the A16 doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, we still appreciated the strong performance Apple’s most affordable tablet delivers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and did we mention the battery life? Our tests involve running a TV show on a loop with the screen set to max brightness and with True Tone disabled. The tablet lasted for six hours and ten minutes before shutting down, which means you’ll likely get more than 10 hours of real-world use. That’s plenty to get through a busy day of gaming and video watching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple deals don’t stick around for long, so our advice is to hurry up and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ75TN5F?th=1\">get your own A16 iPad for $299</a> before the deal vanishes.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save $50 on the iPad A16</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ75TN5F?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8856d85a8a6b74315db5780ba8a8be6edb196a37e664c640813288db6900a17e","category":"Apple"}
