For me, it’s been another fun year of testing new bikes, components, and plenty of riding gear. During this season I got my first chance to ride the long-standing Specialized Stumpjumper, wrote my first review of a ‘lite’ class eMTB, and had my first opportunity to test clothing from Patagonia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to a surprise health issue, this season wasn’t about setting goals or breaking personal records, it was more a mission to retain my normal capabilities and lifestyle! Thankfully that didn’t prove too difficult and I enjoyed a long season of riding and product testing. Keep reading to see what products stood out the most to me throughout 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>About Steve</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-pants-SF-climbing-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-pants-SF-climbing-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Steve Fisher climbing, EC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-pants-SF-climbing-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-pants-SF-climbing-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-pants-SF-climbing-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-pants-SF-climbing-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-pants-SF-climbing-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Craft-pants-SF-climbing-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s most interesting thing ‘about Steve’ is coming up in the next section, but here’s my annual rundown of who I am and why I love to ride bikes. I grew up in Ontario, Canada, riding BMX since the age of five. At 24, I obtained a degree in journalism and moved to British Columbia. My BMX was quickly relegated to pump track and dirt jump duty as I immediately got interested in riding MTB. My first landlord was a dedicated rider and mechanic, and after selling me one of his bikes he mentored me into the MTB scene. Thanks Bill!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time I had no idea several years later I’d find myself writing for Bikerumor. I had many published articles in Whistler-based tourism magazines, but suddenly the opportunity came to combine my writing skills with my passion for bikes. Since then I’ve been enjoying constantly expanding my knowledge of bikes and gear, and of course, getting to test ride the latest and greatest bikes!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best (?) Experience: </h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Living and Riding with Diabetes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/diabetes-supplies-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/diabetes-supplies-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Diabetes supplies, EC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/diabetes-supplies-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/diabetes-supplies-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/diabetes-supplies-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/diabetes-supplies-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/diabetes-supplies-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/diabetes-supplies-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it certainly wasn’t the ‘best’ experience of my year, but definitely the most significant! This spring, I got the surprise of my life when I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. I was 41 years old, a pretty healthy guy, and with no history of Type 1 diabetes in my bloodline. I was likely diabetic for several months before the final crash hit me. Following two days of extreme fatigue and throwing up, I went to the doctor and got the diagnosis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then I’ve learned how to eat a diabetic-friendly diet, and how to check and monitor my blood sugar levels constantly. Of course, I immediately asked the doctors what impact diabetes would have on my riding. Thankfully, an active lifestyle is ideal for diabetics – exercise naturally reduces blood sugar levels. The main concern when you’re a diabetic cyclist is ensuring you don’t run your blood sugar too low while you’re out riding. There is a simple solution to that: Ride with snacks! Skittles became an initial favorite for me since they’re juicy and won’t melt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several months in, I’ve had no serious incidents related to my diabetes and I enjoyed a full season of shredding as usual! For anyone out there who might face the same diagnosis, rest assured it is manageable. It’s very overwhelming and concerning at first, but it only takes a few weeks to get the hang of things. I sure will miss coming home from a ride and devouring an entire pizza though!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mountain Bikes:</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>EDITOR’S CHOICE – Specialized Stumpjumper 15</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SF-Specialized-Stumpjumper-15-berm-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"743\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SF-Specialized-Stumpjumper-15-berm-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Stumpjumper 15 carbon, SF, berm EC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SF-Specialized-Stumpjumper-15-berm-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SF-Specialized-Stumpjumper-15-berm-297x184.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SF-Specialized-Stumpjumper-15-berm-120x74.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SF-Specialized-Stumpjumper-15-berm-768x476.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re talking about ‘quiver killer’ bikes, the Specialized Stumpjumper will likely come up in that conversation. In May I joined the launch event for the new <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-stumpjumper-15-pro-trail-bike-review/\">Stumpjumper 15 Carbon</a></strong>, then brought the bike home for further testing. I was not surprised to find this bike, after decades of refinement, is indeed a top consideration for one MTB that can do it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stumpy already had a proven suspension linkage, but this year Specialized introduced the Genie rear shocks on the Stumpjumper 15. This unique dual air chamber shock allows independent fine-tuning of the first 70% and the last 30% of its stroke. Using volume spacers, riders can control the progressiveness of both the initial/mid-stroke zone and end-stroke ramp-up. Specialized says the Stumpy’s 145mm of rear travel is tuned to deliver a bottomless feel. I’d agree they’ve done a great job of tuning the linkage to offer light action into the mid-stroke while providing strong bottom-out resistance with the Genie shock’s help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stumpjumper 15’s adjustable frame geometry offers a suitable range of steering angles from 63-65.5° and two BB height settings. Smaller frames ride on MX wheels, but the S3-S6 frame sizes can run full 29” or MX wheelsets. The frames also offer in-frame storage, plus lots of room for water bottles and long travel dropper posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing that impressed me was the weight of the carbon models – my size S3 test bike weighed 31.72 lbs with pedals! Specialized’s move to wireless derailleur compatibility only on the carbon frames may not sit well with some people, but they did keep derailleur cable routing on the aluminum-framed Stumpjumpers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HONORABLE MENTION – RMB Altitude Carbon 70 Coil</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RMB-Altitude-C70-Coil-over-meadows-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RMB-Altitude-C70-Coil-over-meadows-jpg.webp\" alt=\"RMB Altitude Carbon 70 Coil, lookout EC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RMB-Altitude-C70-Coil-over-meadows-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RMB-Altitude-C70-Coil-over-meadows-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RMB-Altitude-C70-Coil-over-meadows-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RMB-Altitude-C70-Coil-over-meadows-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RMB-Altitude-C70-Coil-over-meadows-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RMB-Altitude-C70-Coil-over-meadows-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My 2024 season started off on the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-rocky-mountain-altitude-carbon-70-coil-review-for-a-smoother-ride-go-for-the-coil/\">Rocky Mountain Altitude Carbon 70 Coil</a>. I was stoked to try this bike as I’ve ridden the previous model, and the new version has changed significantly with a revived LC2R suspension linkage. This was also the first chance I had to ride a Rocky Mountain with a coil rear shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between the 160mm LC2R linkage and coil shock, I found the new Altitude did offer better overall bump-eating capability than the previous design. Plowing through rough trails was a breeze on this bike, and I was pleasantly surprised by how well the coil-equipped bike climbed. Using the shock’s climb switch is highly recommended, but with its help the Altitude clawed uphill with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Altitudes include all the bells and whistles of a modern enduro bike. RMB equips small frames with 27.5” wheels and M-XL sizes with 29” wheels, but the M-XLs do offer MX wheel compatibility. They come with reach-adjust headsets, RMB’s Ride 4 chip to fine-tune geometry and suspension progression, in-frame storage, and ample space for water bottles. Steering angles are nice and slack, and the rear ends were kept long enough to provide a stable ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d happily take a few more millimeters of reach on this bike, and I’d rather have a 170mm post than the 150mm stocked on the medium frame. Aside from that the only complaint I had was noticeable rattling from the internally routed cables/hoses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>eMTBs:</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>EDITOR’S CHOICE – Devinci E-Troy Lite GX AXS 12S</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Devinci-E-Troy-Lite-side-LLL.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Devinci-E-Troy-Lite-side-LLL.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci E-Troy Lite, side, EC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Devinci-E-Troy-Lite-side-LLL.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Devinci-E-Troy-Lite-side-LLL-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Devinci-E-Troy-Lite-side-LLL-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Devinci-E-Troy-Lite-side-LLL-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Devinci-E-Troy-Lite-side-LLL-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Devinci-E-Troy-Lite-side-LLL-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Devinci’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/devinci-e-troy-lite-gx-axs-12s-review/\">E-Troy Lite GX AXS 12S</a><strong> </strong>was the first eMTB I’ve ridden that isn’t in the ‘full power’ class, and it quickly convinced me that with the correct power-to-weight ratio, a smaller motor and battery can still provide ample juice for anything short of all-day marathon trail rides.  And while it still outweighs an unassisted bike by a fair chunk, the 44.5lbs E-Troy Lite did offer a noticeably more agile and playful ride than a 55-60lbs eMTB. The MX wheel setup also helps the E-Troy Lite whip around corners nicely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devinci gave this bike a Bosch powertrain, with their Performance Line SX motor putting out 600w and 55Nm of torque. The battery is a 400Wh unit, and I like Bosch’s compact and ergonomic mini remote. The top tube display makes it easy to check on the most important things (assist level and battery life) without getting too complex. There are four assist levels to choose from, and throughout my testing, the system performed without fault.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electronics aside, the E-Troy Lite’s frame geometry is almost exactly what I’d custom build for myself, so I found the bike very comfortable and capable on the trails. Devinci’s Split Pivot suspension proved itself with good small and big bump capability and just the right amount of progression for me. At 150mm rear travel (with a 160mm fork) the E-Troy Lite is a versatile ‘lite’ eMTB that could feel at home on a vast variety of terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Components:</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>EDITOR’S CHOICE – WTB SG1 Judge and Verdict Tires</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WTB-SG1-tires-layers-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WTB-SG1-tires-layers-jpg.webp\" alt=\"WTB SG1 tires, layer graphic EC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WTB-SG1-tires-layers-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WTB-SG1-tires-layers-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WTB-SG1-tires-layers-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WTB-SG1-tires-layers-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WTB-SG1-tires-layers-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WTB-SG1-tires-layers-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While they weren’t the most suitable choice for me personally, I have to applaud WTB for their new ‘Tough AF’ <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wtb-introduces-sg1-construction-for-new-tough-af-mtb-tires/\">SG1 tires</a>. I tested the Verdict (front) and Judge (rear) models and was truly impressed with their grip in wet conditions. WTB updated their High Grip compound for these new tires, and created a new rubber they say is less slippery when it gets wet. I’d say these tires gripped wet rocks and roots better than anything I’ve ridden yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My only issue with the tires was their weight, but WTB did set out to make these tires feel supportive and to strongly resist punctures and sidewall damage. They are targeting eMTB riders or wheel wreckers with these beefy treads, so some extra weight should be expected. I would happily run these tires on a downhill bike, but I don’t own one currently. I tested the tires on my enduro and for a lightweight guy like me they felt heavy and slow on the climbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer tires with a sturdy, supportive sidewall you’ll enjoy the ride from the SG1 tires. WTB even suggests these tires are tough enough that some riders may be able to remove tire inserts without sacrificing ample rim protection. The nice thing is, the tread section of the tires is still pliable enough to provide consistent grip on chattery terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Clothing and Gear:</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>EDITOR’S CHOICE – 7mesh Spruce Hoody</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-SF-Mt-Currie-view-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-SF-Mt-Currie-view-jpg.webp\" alt=\"7mesh Spruce hoody, SF, lookout, EC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-SF-Mt-Currie-view-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-SF-Mt-Currie-view-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-SF-Mt-Currie-view-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-SF-Mt-Currie-view-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-SF-Mt-Currie-view-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-SF-Mt-Currie-view-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, 7mesh hit it out of the park with their new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/7mesh-spruce-hoody-review/\">Spruce Hoody</a>. Made from their new WTV 200 fabric, this hoody offers top-notch temperature regulation for cool rides. I wore this hoody on all of my rides from October to December, and every time it was the right choice. This is definitely an insulating layer you can leave on for a whole ride and remain comfortable throughout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WTV 200 fabric does a great job of retaining body heat, but before you get too sweaty it starts letting heat and moisture escape. It’s impressive how warm the Spruce Hoody can keep you for how thin the fabric is, and if things get really chilly the hood will stretch over a helmet. For near-freezing rides, this thin hoody layers comfortably under a jacket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7mesh kept construction light with an elastic waist hem, elastic cuffs, and no cinches on the hood. There is some room for cargo via two zippered front pockets. I don’t mind pullovers, but ultimately I do prefer a full front zipper like the Spruce Hoody offers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only thing this highly breathable hoody cannot offer is water resistance, but that’s a fair trade for how well it performs in all other aspects.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>EDITOR’S CHOICE – Patagonia Dirt Roamer Storm Jacket</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-Storm-jacket-hood-wet.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-Storm-jacket-hood-wet.jpg\" alt=\"Patagonia Dirt Roamer Storm jacket, wet EC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-Storm-jacket-hood-wet.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-Storm-jacket-hood-wet-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-Storm-jacket-hood-wet-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Patagonia-Dirt-Roamer-Storm-jacket-hood-wet-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This year was my first chance to try some gear from Patagonia. I was happy with the jersey, shorts, pants, and chamois I tested as well, but the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/patagonias-dirt-roamer-storm-jacket-dirt-craft-pants-review/\">Dirt Roamer Storm Jacket</a> impressed me the most. This pullover is waterproof, not just resistant, and it did keep me perfectly dry through rainy rides. Patagonia gave it a large hood that easily fits over a helmet, which really helps keep you cozy when the rain is falling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from its waterproofing, the Dirt Roamer Storm’s ventilation is its next best asset. Two huge side vents that can be opened from the top or bottom allow for plenty of airflow adjustment. Opening the 3/4 length main zipper lets quite a bit of air in too.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The jacket fit me great, with long enough arms and body for full coverage and a reasonably lean cut with room for layering underneath. Patagonia included one lower back pocket for small items, which proved pretty easy to access. For the foreseeable future, this will be my go-to jacket for wet rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>EDITOR’S CHOICE – Crankbrothers Stamp Trail BOA Shoes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Trail-BOA-shoes-two-shot-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Trail-BOA-shoes-two-shot-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Crankbrothers Stamp Trail BOA shoes, pair, EC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Trail-BOA-shoes-two-shot-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Trail-BOA-shoes-two-shot-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Trail-BOA-shoes-two-shot-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Trail-BOA-shoes-two-shot-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Trail-BOA-shoes-two-shot-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Crankbrothers-Stamp-Trail-BOA-shoes-two-shot-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Early in 2024, I started test-riding Crankbrothers’ <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/crankbrothers-stamp-trail-boa-shoes-offer-good-grip-low-weight-and-quick-easy-boa-system/\">Stamp Trail Boa shoes</a>. Right away, I started wearing them on every ride and left my other shoes aside. The first thing I liked about these shoes is how lightweight they are. I’ve never complained about other shoes being too heavy, but when you put on a nice light pair they feel good! I’ll admit the thin uppers aren’t super protective for your feet, but I liked the lean profile of the shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stamp Trail BOAs proved to offer good weather protection and durability. I rode these shoes a lot this summer, and their fabric held up to the abuse. The soles also provide ample stiffness; they did break in a bit but remained stiff enough for good pedal support throughout the whole season. The only thing that wore noticeably was the padded tongue, which has packed in quite a bit after months of riding. The shoes are still perfectly comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The BOA system makes it quick and easy to pull these shoes on or off, and the single dial design cinched down on my feet evenly enough for a solid, comfortable fit. Lastly, the flat soles offered good grip on various pedals but weren’t so grabby that adjusting your foot position was difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HONORABLE MENTION – Smith Motive Sunglasses</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SMITH-Motive-sunglasses-front-angle-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"704\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SMITH-Motive-sunglasses-front-angle-jpg.webp\" alt=\"SMITH Motive sunglasses, front angle, EC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SMITH-Motive-sunglasses-front-angle-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SMITH-Motive-sunglasses-front-angle-297x174.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SMITH-Motive-sunglasses-front-angle-120x70.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SMITH-Motive-sunglasses-front-angle-768x451.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I got to try two pairs of SMITH sunglasses this year, and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/smith-motive-wildcat-mtb-sunglasses-review/\">Motives</a> quickly became my favorite. With sunglasses, fit is a huge factor, and I liked the way the Motives fit and looked on my face. The large lenses cover nearly your entire field of view and provide great eye protection, and as long as I was moving at any speed they would not fog up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My Motives came with Chromapop Voilet Mirror lenses and clear lenses. I love getting a clear set with sunglasses as it doubles their functionality, and the Violet Mirror lenses were dark enough for bright sunny rides. It’s also very easy to swap the Motives’ lenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Motive sunglasses stayed put on my nose, offered good helmet compatibility, and they’re not too sporty looking to wear casually. SMITH includes a hard case and a soft lens bag with each pair. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HONORABLE MENTION – Specialized Trail Wind Jacket:</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-under-windbreaker-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-under-windbreaker-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Trail Wind jacket, over hoody, EC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-under-windbreaker-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-under-windbreaker-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-under-windbreaker-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-under-windbreaker-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-under-windbreaker-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-under-windbreaker-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Stumpjumper launch event this Spring, Specialized set us up with some of their clothing and gear to ride in. The one piece I’ve used the most this year has been the <strong><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/ca/en/mens-trail-wind-jacket/p/199631?color=1000113827-199631\">Trail Wind jacket</a></strong>. The Trail Wind jacket is a thin, lightweight layer ideal for those days where you ask yourself “Do I really need a jacket?” If you have any cargo storage available, it’s an easy choice to bring this one along and avoid a chilly start to your ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no incredible technology or fancy materials to make this jacket breathable, so you will want to remove it once you warm up. Packing up to about the size of my fist, the jacket is easy to stash in a pack or even a frame storage compartment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This pullover’s half-length zipper opens up large enough to easily slip over a helmet. The hood will stretch over a helmet too, but it’s not super roomy. It would be a bit restrictive to pedal around with the hood up, but it would help fend off light rain in a pinch.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 5’10” I have a size medium which fits me very well. It offers a nice lean body cut but with ample mobility and enough length in the arms and body.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Off The Bike:</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>EDITOR’S CHOICE – Purist Mover 18oz Coffee Mug</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Purist-Mover-coffee-mug-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1424\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Purist-Mover-coffee-mug-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Purist Mover coffee mug, EC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Purist-Mover-coffee-mug-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Purist-Mover-coffee-mug-253x300.webp 253w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Purist-Mover-coffee-mug-101x120.webp 101w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Purist-Mover-coffee-mug-768x911.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes we MTB journalists get pretty useful bits of promotional swag. At the launch for the Stumpjumper 15, Specialized gave the media crew <a href=\"https://www.puristcollective.com/collections/all/products/mover-18oz\">Purist Mover 18oz</a><strong> </strong>coffee mugs. I’m a coffee-loving guy, and I am stoked on this mug! Most importantly, it keeps coffee warm for at least five hours, but I also love the Scope Top lid design. You can drink from any part of it, and it doesn’t let a bunch of hot coffee dump into your mouth and torch your tongue. It’s also spillproof when closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far I’ve had no issues with bits of old coffee building up inside the lid’s mechanism, and I have only one small complaint about the mug. If left closed, it will retain the odor of coffee inside. If stored with the lid off, it loses the scent. Since I use mine for coffee only, I don’t mind that it retains the smell. I think it’ll be a long time before I find a coffee travel mug that tops this one!  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HONORABLE MENTION – Thule Chasm 26L Backpack</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Thule-Chasm-26L-backpack-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1459\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Thule-Chasm-26L-backpack-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Thule Chasm 26L backpack, EC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Thule-Chasm-26L-backpack-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Thule-Chasm-26L-backpack-247x300.webp 247w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Thule-Chasm-26L-backpack-99x120.webp 99w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Thule-Chasm-26L-backpack-768x934.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Early this year I received a <a href=\"https://www.thule.com/en-us/backpacks/laptop-backpacks/thule-chasm-backpack-26l-_-3204984\">Chasm 26L backpack</a> from Thule. To be honest, I didn’t realize how broad a line of backpacks and luggage Thule offered until I got this pack. After several months of using it almost daily, I’d say the quality their car racks are known for carries over into their backpack line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chasm 26L is a medium-sized backpack designed for hiking or daily use – it is not a cycling-specific pack so it cannot carry a water reservoir. It can carry a laptop (up to 16”) in a padded sleeve and offers a decent-sized main cargo area for daily needs. A second full-length pocket features dividers and inside pockets to organize your stuff. On top is a soft-lined pouch for sunglasses or phones, and the side has a stretch pocket ideal for a water bottle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chasm 26L is made from 900D polyester fabric with a PFC-free water-repellent finish, and it easily withstands short walks in the rain.  After months of use, the backpack is showing no damage or wear anywhere. I also noticed the straps stay in place very well, as the buckles have never slipped as I wriggle my arms through them. I find this pack quite comfortable to wear, and I expect it will provide me with many years of service.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Parting Thoughts:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SF-RMB-Altitude-carbon-70-coil-TOP-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SF-RMB-Altitude-carbon-70-coil-TOP-jpg.webp\" alt=\"RMB Altitude Carbon 70 Coil, SF, TOP rock, EC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SF-RMB-Altitude-carbon-70-coil-TOP-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SF-RMB-Altitude-carbon-70-coil-TOP-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SF-RMB-Altitude-carbon-70-coil-TOP-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SF-RMB-Altitude-carbon-70-coil-TOP-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SF-RMB-Altitude-carbon-70-coil-TOP-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SF-RMB-Altitude-carbon-70-coil-TOP-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Goodbye 2024, it’s been fun! Even facing a little learning curve regarding how to ride safely with my newfound diabetes, I wound up having a great riding season, testing many high-quality products from some great brands like 7mesh, Patagonia, Thule, and SMITH.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my biggest takeaways from this year is that if I did buy myself an eMTB, I now would seriously consider something in the ‘mid’ or ‘lite’ class. The Devinci E-Troy Lite won me over with ample power, enough range for my usual rides, and better handling than a bigger bulkier eMTB. It will be cool to watch the battle between power output and weight continue over the next few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for reading Bikerumor, keep on shredding, and take care of yourselves!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>-Steve</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Each of these products was entirely chosen purely on their technical merits, by me personally, and for the reasons described above. More great products passed through my hands in 2024. Under no circumstances were any of my picks, paid for by their producers. Nor was any preference or favor given to the brand or advertiser. My selections are mostly (but not exclusively) limited to products I’ve actually spent time riding/testing in person. So a brand’s willingness to invite Bikerumor to join a launch event, or to provide product samples can make it more likely that we will have considered their products, if only because we can share our real, firsthand experiences.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikerumor-editors-choice-2024-steves-best-bikes-and-gear/\">BikeRumor Editor’s Choice 2024 – Steve’s Best Bikes and Gear</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"358c008b440332f005ccdf8f11f978db0832799caa4490673f20763ec6ea848b","category":"Cycling"}
