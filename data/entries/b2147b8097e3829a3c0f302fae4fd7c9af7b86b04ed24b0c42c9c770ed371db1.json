Apple then tested it in iOS 17.2, but ended up pulling the collaborative functionality <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/ios-17-2-beta-4-features/\">in the fourth beta</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn ‌Apple Music‌, when you create a new playlist or select an existing playlist, there's a little person-shaped icon that can be tapped to enable collaboration. Choosing this option provides a link where anyone can contribute a song.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThose who want to try it out in iOS 17.3 can click on <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/pl.u-kaJH7JG97e?a=join&amp;it=zr6IZVEGZ6tVoblq\">the MacRumors playlist link</a> to try adding a song.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe person who started the collaboration can opt to approve those who ask to add songs, but this is not enabled by default. Anyone with the link to a playlist can add music, though the owner can turn off collaboration at any time or remove people.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said earlier this week that collaborative ‌Apple Music‌ playlists would launch in 2024, which is the right timing for when we expect iOS 17.3 to launch.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-beta-apple-music-collaborative-playlists/\">iOS 17.3 Beta Adds Collaborative Apple Music Playlists Again</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-3-beta-adds-collaborative-apple-music-playlists-again.2413531/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b2147b8097e3829a3c0f302fae4fd7c9af7b86b04ed24b0c42c9c770ed371db1","category":"Apple"}
