Both with backgrounds in product design and engineering are committed to bringing a wealth of design, technology, and craftsmanship to every Coh&amp;Co product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>The inspiration for Siggi came when we realized that there are a lot of advantages to small wheels that we can also put into the urban environment without making all of the compromises that often come with it. It is born not out of a need to fold, it is born out of a need to ride</em>.” – Paul Harder Cohen</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To enhance your riding experience and everyday convenience, Coh&amp;Co says Siggi is packed with functional features. When they designed it, they strived to create the ideal urban bicycle – a bike that provides a responsive and comfortable ride while adapting to everyday urban life. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-fork.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-fork.jpeg\" alt=\"Coh&amp;Co Siggi foldable bike fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-fork.jpeg 750w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-fork-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-fork-120x120.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Siggi has 20″ wheels which help in making it easy to fold and store, making it easy to bring on a train, pack in the truck of your car, or store in your home or office. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-top-tube-e1687294019873.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"577\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-top-tube-e1687294019873.jpeg\" alt=\"Coh&amp;Co Siggi foldable bike top tube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-top-tube-e1687294019873.jpeg 750w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-top-tube-e1687294019873-297x228.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-top-tube-e1687294019873-120x92.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The stout, but short top tube pulls dual purpose as a handle as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-handle-bar.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-handle-bar.jpeg\" alt=\"Coh&amp;Co Siggi foldable bike handle bar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-handle-bar.jpeg 750w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-handle-bar-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-handle-bar-120x120.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bicycle’s handlebar and cockpit are also fully adjustable, making it easy to find the right fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-rear-rack.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-rear-rack.jpeg\" alt=\"Coh&amp;Co Siggi foldable bike rear rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-rear-rack.jpeg 750w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-rear-rack-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-rear-rack-120x120.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear rack looks to serve as a rack and a stand for the Siggi when it’s folded. It even incorporates rollers to help maneuver it into position once folded. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-disc-brakes.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-disc-brakes.jpeg\" alt=\"Coh&amp;Co Siggi foldable bike disc brakes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-disc-brakes.jpeg 750w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-disc-brakes-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-disc-brakes-120x120.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Siggi also has a carbon “lefty” fork, which plays a key part in keeping the total weight of the bike lower as well as aiding in Siggi’s elegant fold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the pictures, it looks like the Siggi will have an elastomer-based rear suspension system, as well as whatever the suspension system is on the fork.  According to their website, there will be an electric Siggi available as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>“Designing Bicycles for Life”</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-hero-e1687294238256.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"612\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-hero-e1687294238256-800x612.jpeg\" alt=\"Coh&amp;Co Siggi foldable bike hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-hero-e1687294238256-800x612.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-hero-e1687294238256-297x227.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-hero-e1687294238256-120x92.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-hero-e1687294238256-768x587.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CohCo-Siggi-foldable-bike-hero-e1687294238256.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Siggi rendering.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>StoneWeave Frame:</strong> “<em>Siggi’s frame is made of StoneWeave,</em> <em>our proprietary frame material technology. It is a special blend of carbon and basalt rock. On top of being lightweight, super durable, and stiff, it is recyclable at the end of its life span”.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Designed in Copenhagen: </strong><em>“We’re called Coh&amp;Co Copenhagen for a reason.
