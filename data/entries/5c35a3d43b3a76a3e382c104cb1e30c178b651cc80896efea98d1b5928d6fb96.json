The iconic desktop computer is a great combination of price and performance. Even with that, every Mac has a release cycle, and you should ask yourself if this is a good time to buy now or wait until later when a new version is released. Here’s what we know about the 24-inch iMac and our buying advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Updated 11/01/23:</strong> Apple just updated the iMac to the M3 processor, making this the best time to buy Apple’s all-in-one computer if you’re interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>24-inch iMac: Pricing and specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Released: November 2023</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 24-inch iMac was the last Mac to be outfitted with Apple’s M1 processor, and it skipped the M2 generation entirely. After more than two years on the market, it was among the first Macs to be available with an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2120691/m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-specs-features-cpu-gpu.html\">M3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replacing the 21.5-inch iMac that used Intel processors, the 24-inch iMac not only has a new processor inside, but also features an all-new, cleaner design with smaller bezels, a larger screen area, and new colors. It also has Touch ID support, an improved FaceTime 1080p camera, and Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484743/24-inch-imac-release-date-specs-m2-m3-processor-price.html\">new M3 version</a> remains mostly unchanged from the M1 version. The wireless compatibility was upgraded to Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 and it’s available with up to 24GB of RAM, but there are no other significant changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing for the 24-inch iMac starts at $1,299, but that model is missing a few features that are found on the $1,499 and $1,699 standard configurations. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>24-inch iMac: Why you should buy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 24-inch iMac is a great all-in-one computer that offers a huge boost over the Intel iMacs. If you need a complete computer setup (computer, display, input devices), the iMac is a good way to go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the recent upgrade to M3, we don’t expect to see this system upgraded again for at least a year. A larger iMac is rumored to be on the way, but not until late 2024 at the earliest, and it will likely cost a lot more.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple 24-inch iMac (M3, 2023)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2400\" height=\"1714\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/m3-imac.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple 24-inch iMac (M3, 2023)\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/m3-imac.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/m3-imac.jpg?resize=300%2C214&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/m3-imac.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/m3-imac.jpg?resize=1200%2C857&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/m3-imac.jpg?resize=1536%2C1097&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/m3-imac.jpg?resize=2048%2C1463&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,299 base model\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-549735-5-2121020-9934&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac\" target=\"_blank\">$1299 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>24-inch iMac: Why you should wait</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no real reason to wait for a newer Mac all-in-one system; there doesn’t appear to be anything better on the horizon. The real alternative to this is a different Mac desktop—either a Mac mini or Mac Studio—together with a stand-alone monitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Macworld recommends: BUY</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 24-inch iMac with M3 is likely to be the best iMac available for a year, perhaps longer. And being brand-new, you probably won’t find much in the way of significant sales or refurbished models available for at least a few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in an iMac, there’s no good reason to wait.</p>\n\niMac, Mac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5c35a3d43b3a76a3e382c104cb1e30c178b651cc80896efea98d1b5928d6fb96","category":"Apple"}
