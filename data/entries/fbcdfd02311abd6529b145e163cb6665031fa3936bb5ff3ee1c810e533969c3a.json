The kerosene-fueled engine—flying without the aid of solid rocket boosters on this flight—fired more than four minutes, then a hydrogen-burning engine on the rocket's Centaur upper stage took over for a 10-minute burn to reach a targeted 311-mile-high (500-kilometer) orbit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973955#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973955&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fbcdfd02311abd6529b145e163cb6665031fa3936bb5ff3ee1c810e533969c3a","category":"Tech"}
