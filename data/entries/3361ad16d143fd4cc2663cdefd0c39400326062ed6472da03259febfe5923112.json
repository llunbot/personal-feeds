The news wasn't widely shared until Wednesday, when NASA science chief <a href=\"https://x.com/NASAScienceAA/status/1917609893927772384\">Nicky Fox posted it on X</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Engineers with NASA’s Psyche mission are working to determine what caused a recent decrease in fuel pressure in the spacecraft’s propulsion system,\" the agency said. The spacecraft detected the drop in pressure April 1 inside the line that feeds xenon fuel to the spacecraft's four plasma thrusters.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/engineers-probe-pressure-drop-in-psyche-spacecrafts-propulsion-system/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/engineers-probe-pressure-drop-in-psyche-spacecrafts-propulsion-system/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3361ad16d143fd4cc2663cdefd0c39400326062ed6472da03259febfe5923112","category":"Tech"}
