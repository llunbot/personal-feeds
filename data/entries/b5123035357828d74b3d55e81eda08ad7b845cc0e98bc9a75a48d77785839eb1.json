Pictures.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-TV-F1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nIn the film, Brad Pitt stars as an F1 driver who was an up-and-coming talent in the 1990s, until an accident on the track nearly ended his career. Thirty years later, Pitt is invited to join a former teammate's struggling F1 team, in a last-shot bid to save the team and become the best in the world.
