Craddock and Cort worked alongside Andrea Bagioli (Deceuninck-QuickStep), Andreas Kron (Lotto Soudal), Rui Oliveira (UAE Team Emirates), Anthony Roux (Groupama-FdJ) and Quinn Simmons (Trek-Segafredo).</p>\n<p>Their lead remained at a minute and a half going into the final 20km due to their cohesive efforts while Team BikeExchange worked hard at the head of the peloton be bring the gap down.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10017/flanders-uci-road-cycling-world-championships-2021-key-information\">Flanders UCI Road Cycling World Championships 2021: Key information</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10082/why-this-team-rode-bright-green-front-wheels-at-the-tour-of-britain\">Why this team rode bright green front wheels at the Tour of Britain</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nWith the help of Team DSM they managed to narrow the gap to under 22 seconds but ultimately ran out of road to reel the break in. Simmons kicked first, launching his sprint with 200m to go, but Cort edged him out to complete his set of stage wins from all three weeks of the 2021 Vuelta as Craddock celebrated behind.</p>\n<p>After two punishing mountain stages, a far gentler parours saw Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma) and the red jersey get through the day entirely unscathed. With a buffer of 2:30sec over nearest rival Enric Mas of Movistar, Roglič's own hattrick of wins – in his case overall Vuelta titles, not just stages – is now all but certain with just two stages remaining.</p>\n<p>Here is photographer Chris Auld's selection from the day's action:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10050/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-19-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 37</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/vuelta_a_espana_2021_stage_19_01.jpg?itok=aLGKfmyU\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>37</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/10050/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-19-gallery\">Vuelta a Espana 2021 Stage 19 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/chris-auld\">Chris Auld</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>4 Sep 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10050%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-19-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2019%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10050%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-19-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2019%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10050%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-19-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2019%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10050%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-19-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10050/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-19-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 37</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/vuelta_a_espana_2021_stage_19_01.jpg?itok=aLGKfmyU\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"63ff63b1227c246c64f2640a13f8d1f6b29986f225f3fafdd1589dfc8fd7d1e3","category":"Cycling"}
