The meetings will be held with Sarah Friar, the company's chief financial officer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe European Commission last month said it was exploring the possibility of an antitrust investigation into Microsoft and OpenAI's partnership. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also looking at investments made by companies including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google into generative AI start-ups.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple and OpenAI's deal will see Siri able to hand complicated user requests over to ChatGPT with explicit user permission. OpenAI is not paying Apple to integrate ChatGPT in its operating systems, nor is Apple paying OpenAI. No money is being exchanged under the terms of the arrangement at the current time. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/apple-drops-openai-board-observer-role/\">Apple Drops OpenAI Board Observer Role Amid Regulator Scrutiny</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-drops-openai-board-observer-role-amid-regulator-scrutiny.2431034/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e758bba0d1490c2fd3eaf938ac364808cb3e04fccb37924da72271d86cfe2834","category":"Apple"}
