Back then, cyclists were riding <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-steel-road-bike\">steel framed bikes</a> with toe clips and straps, quill stems and chunky saddles. In the last ten years, changes to road (and gravel) bikes have seemed less dramatic though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think back a decade and<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\"> road bikes</a> almost all had rim brakes and rode on 23mm tyres pumped up to 100psi. Low gears were for wimps and meant a triple chainset. Although the basic outline of road bikes back then was broadly similar to today (thank you, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/thinking-outside-the-box-what-if-there-were-no-uci-rules\">UCI</a>), look closer and a lot of the tech and the parts bolted onto a bike have changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the changes have been ported over from mountain bikes to drop bar bikes, so they’re not really ‘new’, just new to roadies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After refreshing our all-time<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/?s=game+changer%3A\"> ‘Game Changers’ series</a> over the past two weeks, here’s our pick of the tech that’s changed the game in just the last ten years and the products that presaged it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Hydraulic disc brakes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/fotojet_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Disc brakes vs rim brakes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/fotojet_1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/fotojet_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/fotojet_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/fotojet_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/fotojet_1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/fotojet_1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/fotojet_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/fotojet_1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/fotojet_1.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Joseph Branston</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mountain bikers may have invented disc brakes years ago, but it took a while for it to catch on on road bikes.

Again, there were <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-tubeless-tyres\">tubeless road tyres </a>available pre-2015 – Hutchinson launched the first back in 2006. But it’s only in the last ten years that tubeless road tyres and the rims to support them have gone mainstream. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyre and rim combos are much more reliable now, so you’re unlikely to find a tyre that blows off the rim when you inflate it, unlike ten years ago. And while pro teams were until recently glued to their <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-tubular-tyres-dead\">tubular tyres</a>, even they have been converted to run tubeless.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n

Now, Zipp’s premium road wheels, for example, sport 25mm internal width. They’re also <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\">hookless</a>, another tech that’s been hinted at taking over, but some brands – and many consumers – such as DT Swiss aren’t converted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deep section carbon wheels were available in 2015, but they typically had a pointy profile, which would catch a sidewind, making riding interesting.
