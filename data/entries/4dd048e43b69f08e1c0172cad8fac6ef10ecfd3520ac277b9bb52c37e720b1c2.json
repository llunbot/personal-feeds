But a few rumors have popped up that hint at what the official compatibility list will be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://iphonesoft.fr/2024/03/30/apple-watch-compatibles-watchos-11&amp;xcust=1-1-2285372-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">report</a> by iPhoneSoft, compatibility with watchOS 11 (which is the next major version of the Apple Watch operating system) starts with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233334/apple-watch-series-5-review.html\">Apple Watch Series 5</a>. That means that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667795/apple-watch-series-4-review.html\">Series 4 </a>has run its course, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1792869/watchos-10-release-date-new-features.html\">watchOS 10</a> is the last version that device will run. Apple usually supports a device for 5 to 7 years, so dropping the Series 4, which arrived in 2018, isn’t a surprise. Here’s the rumored compatibility list:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Watch Series 5 (2019)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 6 (2020)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 7 (2021)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 8 (2022)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Series 9 (2023)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch SE 1 (2020)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch SE 2 (2022)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Ultra 1 (2022)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple Watch Ultra 2 (2023)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will also show iPadOS 18 at WWDC, and 9to5Mac has a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/01/ipados-18-rumored-to-drop-support-for-these-ipads-ios-18-support-unchanged/&amp;xcust=1-1-2285372-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">report</a> on its compatibility list. Notably, Apple will drop support for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231203/97-inch-ipad-2018-review.html\">6th-generation iPad</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667575/ipad-pro-12-9-2017-review.html\">2nd-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667563/ipad-pro-10-5in-2017-review.html\">10.5-inch iPad Pro</a> with A10 and A10X Fusion chips. The possible compatibility list:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad (2019 and later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini (2019 and later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Air (2019 and later)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Pro (2018 and later)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>9to5Mac also reports that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a> compatibility list is the same as iOS 17 as has been previously reported. iOS 17 support begins with the iPhone XR/XS/XS Max, which use an A12X Bionic chip. Reports of macOS 15’s combability have not popped up, but the most likely to lose support are the 2018 <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667840/mac-mini-2018-review.html\">Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232087/macbook-air-2018-review.html\">MacBook Air</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667733/macbook-pro-13in-2018-review.html\">MacBook Pro</a>, as well as the 2017 <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230880/imac-pro-review-mac-pro-power-in-the-shape-of-an-imac.html\">iMac Pro</a>, all of which have Intel chips.</p>\n\nApple Watch, iPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4dd048e43b69f08e1c0172cad8fac6ef10ecfd3520ac277b9bb52c37e720b1c2","category":"Apple"}
