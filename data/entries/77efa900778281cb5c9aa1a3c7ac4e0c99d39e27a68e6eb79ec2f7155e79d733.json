It says that its wind-tunnel test results show that the new wheels are more aerodynamically efficient than its previous 48 Limitless, and also shed significant weight. The claimed weight for the top-spec Sub50 wheels with carbon spokes is 1,380g, down from the 48 Limitless’s 1,618g. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Hunt Sub 50 Limitless Aero Disc wheelset has a 49.5mm deep rim profile with a 23m internal width rim, along with a hookless bead, a new ratchet freehub and differential 34mm front, 30mm rear external rim widths.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three spec levels with prices that start at £1,479 and rise to £2,289.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related

taken three years to develop the new wheels, and that its aim was to create the fastest wheelset available with a rim depth of under 50mm (hence the Sub50 name). It says that its primary target was to improve its aerodynamics over the existing 48 Limitless wheelset, which was launched in 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also aimed to reduce weight from the 48 Limitless, which we measured at 1,618g when <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/hunt-48-limitless-aero-disc-wheelset-review\" target=\"_blank\">we reviewed the wheels in 2021</a>. Hunt says that its sponsored pro athletes loved the aerodynamics and stability of the 48 Limitless wheels, but wanted a lower weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, wheels have in general been getting <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-rim-width\" target=\"_blank\">wider </a>and several brands have introduced wheelsets with differential front and rear rim profiles. So Hunt’s objective for the Sub50 was to develop an all-round road race wheelset, with four key metrics: aerodynamic efficiency, aerodynamic stability, lower system weight and tyre shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aero efficiency</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"624\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Hunt-Sub50-rim-profiles-970x624.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Hunt-Sub50-rim-profiles-970x624.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Hunt-Sub50-rim-profiles-300x193.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Hunt-Sub50-rim-profiles-768x494.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Hunt-Sub50-rim-profiles-750x482.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Hunt-Sub50-rim-profiles.jpg 1037w\" /><figcaption>Hunt Wheels</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hunt put the Sub50 head-to-head with a range of other wheelsets of similar depth from DT Swiss, Zipp, Enve, Roval, Shimano and Princeton CarbonWorks in the GST WindKanal in Immenstaad on the shores of Lake Constance in Germany. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wind-tunnel testing was carried out in a whole bike setup, which is particularly significant for the rear wheel, where interactions with the frame can affect results. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The facility has also been used by Canyon, SwissSide and others, as well as for motorsports and aircraft testing. Hunt claims that its wind-tunnel tests have a +/-0.3W margin of error.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It says that of the competitor wheels it tested, only the 1,456g DT Swiss ARC 1400 DICUT 50 DB were aerodynamically faster with a 28mm tyre, which Hunt attributed to the narrower tyre profile on the 20mm internal width DT Swiss rim than on its 23mm wide rim bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tables turned when running a 30mm tyre though, with Hunt claiming a 1.85W advantage over the DT wheelset. Hunt reckons that its wheels offer lower rolling resistance and added grip and comfort over DT’s wheels due to the wider tyre profile, although this does not appear to have been quantified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/review/zipp-454-nsw-wheel-review\" target=\"_blank\">Zipp 454 NSW wheelset</a>, with its 55/58mm undulating depth and 1,428g weight, Hunt claims that the Sub50 wheelset was 1W faster with 28mm tyres and over 3W faster with 30mm tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When compared to its predecessor 48 Limitless wheels, Hunt found a 1.4W saving for the new wheels when using 28mm wide tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aerodynamic stability </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another claim that Hunt makes for its new wheelset is increased aerodynamic stability, thanks to the wider curve to the rim profile. It says that this gives the wheels the stability in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-ride-in-crosswinds\" target=\"_blank\">crosswinds </a>and steer-ability of a shallower wheelset, which in turn allows the rider to maintain a lower, more aero ride position.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>System weight</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"644\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/HUNT-SUB50-Limitless-Aero-Disc-hubs-970x644.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/HUNT-SUB50-Limitless-Aero-Disc-hubs-970x644.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/HUNT-SUB50-Limitless-Aero-Disc-hubs-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/HUNT-SUB50-Limitless-Aero-Disc-hubs-768x510.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/HUNT-SUB50-Limitless-Aero-Disc-hubs-1536x1020.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/HUNT-SUB50-Limitless-Aero-Disc-hubs-2048x1361.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/HUNT-SUB50-Limitless-Aero-Disc-hubs-750x498.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/HUNT-SUB50-Limitless-Aero-Disc-hubs-1140x757.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/HUNT-SUB50-Limitless-Aero-Disc-hubs-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/HUNT-SUB50-Limitless-Aero-Disc-hubs-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/HUNT-SUB50-Limitless-Aero-Disc-hubs-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Hunt Wheels</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hunt says its unidirectional carbon spokes save 2.7g per spoke over steel, as well as increasing the wheel’s lateral stiffness, allowing it to reduce the number of spokes per wheel. It says that its carbon spokes are trueable and replaceable, unlike monocoque wheel designs such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/syncros-capital-sl-wheels\" target=\"_blank\">Syncros Capital SL</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It says that its latest<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-freehub\" target=\"_blank\"> ratchet freehub</a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-freehub\"> </a>system also reduces weight over its previous pawl-based hubs.

The front rim has a 23mm internal/34.2mm maximum external width, while the rear rim extends outwards a little less, to 30mm maximum width. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All specs use the same Hunt H_Ratchet DBL hubs, with a 40 point of engagement/9-degree engagement angle ratchet freehub and have 18 front and 20 rear wheel spokes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond that, you can choose between the three spoke/bearing variants with a range of weights and prices, as below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HUNT Sub50 Limitless Aero Disc UD Carbon Spoke, CeramicSpeed Bearings</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spokes:</strong> TaperLock UD Carbon</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bearings: </strong>CeramicSpeed, double-sealed</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Claimed weight: </strong>1380g per pair</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>£2,289 / $2,789 / €2,749</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>HUNT Sub50 Limitless Aero Disc UD Carbon Spoke, Stainless Steel Bearings:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spokes: </strong>TaperLock UD Carbon</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bearings:</strong> Double-sealed stainless steel cartridge</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Claimed weight:</strong> 1380g per pair</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>£1,849 / $2249 / €2,279</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>HUNT Sub50 Limitless Aero Disc Steel Spoke, Stainless Steel Bearings:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spokes:</strong> Pillar Wing 20 Elliptical Aero</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bearings: </strong>Double-sealed stainless steel cartridge</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Claimed weight: </strong>1428g per pair</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £1,479 / $1,799 / €1,849</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Hunt says there is a very limited quantity of the new wheels available to pre-order today, with stock delivered by end-February.
