The crew consisted of some folks I’d never met, one of which is named Jon. He’s an eclectic fellow with a unique style and a wicked mustache but what really caught my attention was the bike he was riding. It looked like some sort of klunker beach cruiser thing with twin top tubes and knobby tires, a sharp contrast to the typical “double diamond” frame I was riding and had grown accustomed to seeing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2136\" height=\"1428\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-6.jpg?w=2136&amp;quality=75 2136w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-6.jpg?resize=1024,685&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-6.jpg?resize=2000,1337&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-6.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-6.jpg?resize=1800,1203&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-6.jpg?resize=1335,893&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-6.jpg?resize=700,468&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-6.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-6.jpg?resize=2048,1369&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-8.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-8.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-8.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-8.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-8.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-8.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>“Nice to meet you.

I set the bike up with a cruiser bar and Deore 12 speed but after the honeymoon phase, I eventually never rode it that often and wasn’t sure how it fit into the stable.</p>\n<p>I’ve found that I most enjoy things that have been used and have stories to tell. An old pickup truck, a favorite weathered and faded hat, a film camera, old tools, ghost towns. The Sawyer fits this aesthetic perfectly with its raw and slightly rusted patina, quick-release dropouts, and throwback frame design made with Trek’s “<em>Platinum Series Chromoly</em>” (whatever that means), so it looks pretty but should handle a party.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2136\" height=\"1428\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-7.jpg?w=2136&amp;quality=75 2136w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-7.jpg?resize=1024,685&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-7.jpg?resize=2000,1337&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-7.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-7.jpg?resize=1800,1203&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-7.jpg?resize=1335,893&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-7.jpg?resize=700,468&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-7.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-7.jpg?resize=2048,1369&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>I’d been doing most of my gravel/adventure/getting weird riding on a bike with more traditional road geometry. I was looking for something more comfortable for those longer “full spectrum” days when more tire clearance, a longer top tube, a shorter stem and no damn toe overlap would be beneficial. A few hours of late-night curiosity research hinted that the Sawyer’s geometry from 2011 is, in some ways, remarkably close to current trends in the gravel/adventure/getting weird category.</p>\n<p>I’ve wanted to build a bike around TRP’s RRL SL levers for years (that drillium, OMG), and I was considering the Sawyer as a strong candidate for a drop bar conversion but never got around to pulling the trigger.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2136\" height=\"1428\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-10.jpg?w=2136&amp;quality=75 2136w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-10.jpg?resize=1024,685&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-10.jpg?resize=2000,1337&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-10.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-10.jpg?resize=1800,1203&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-10.jpg?resize=1335,893&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-10.jpg?resize=700,468&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-10.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-10.jpg?resize=2048,1369&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2136\" height=\"1428\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-5.jpg?w=2136&amp;quality=75 2136w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-5.jpg?resize=1024,685&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-5.jpg?resize=2000,1337&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-5.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-5.jpg?resize=1800,1203&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-5.jpg?resize=1335,893&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-5.jpg?resize=700,468&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-5.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-5.jpg?resize=2048,1369&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>In August, I attended the inaugural MADE show in Portland, OR, and saw numerous examples of how beautiful those levers look on nearly anything. The whole show was a ridiculous mental and sensory overload, but going into it the booth I was most excited to visit was BTCHN’ Bikes out of Chico, CA.</p>\n<p>Tyler not only has an unbridled and contagious enthusiasm. He builds what I consider some of the sexiest bikes I’ve ever seen, and as soon as I saw the two bikes he had on display in person, I instantly knew I was going to be ordering parts for the Sawyer as soon as I got to the hotel room that night.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2136\" height=\"1428\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-14.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-14.jpg?w=2136&amp;quality=75 2136w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-14.jpg?resize=1024,685&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-14.jpg?resize=2000,1337&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-14.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-14.jpg?resize=1800,1203&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-14.jpg?resize=1335,893&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-14.jpg?resize=700,468&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-14.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-14.jpg?resize=2048,1369&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>The TRP brake levers left the shifter options open, and I liked the idea of a 12-speed bar end “suicide shifter” mounted on the left side so I could operate the rear brake and the shifter simultaneously. Nic Morales recently penned a <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-dust-up-an-ode-to-friction-shifting/\" target=\"_blank\">great article on the subject of friction shifters that I recommend checking out</a>.</p>\n<p>I rolled the dice on the Ritchey Beacon XL drop bars in a 52cm width with 36º flare and shallow drops. It was a huge win; descending dirt with this bar is fantastic. The one-off stem was donated to the project by my friend Mark, and it was custom machined by his buddy at a time in history when 35mm x 31.8 stems didn’t exist. The cargo cage was machined by Mr. Dirt Speed Shop in Spokane, WA.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1428\" height=\"2136\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-15.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-15.jpg?w=1428&amp;quality=75 1428w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-15.jpg?resize=1024,1532&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-15.jpg?resize=768,1149&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-15.jpg?resize=1335,1997&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-15.jpg?resize=700,1047&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-15.jpg?resize=1027,1536&amp;quality=75 1027w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-15.jpg?resize=1369,2048&amp;quality=75 1369w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2136\" height=\"1428\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-9.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-9.jpg?w=2136&amp;quality=75 2136w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-9.jpg?resize=1024,685&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-9.jpg?resize=2000,1337&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-9.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-9.jpg?resize=1800,1203&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-9.jpg?resize=1335,893&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-9.jpg?resize=700,468&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-9.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-9.jpg?resize=2048,1369&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1428\" height=\"2136\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-13.jpg?w=1428&amp;quality=75 1428w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-13.jpg?resize=1024,1532&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-13.jpg?resize=768,1149&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-13.jpg?resize=1335,1997&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-13.jpg?resize=700,1047&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-13.jpg?resize=1027,1536&amp;quality=75 1027w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-13.jpg?resize=1369,2048&amp;quality=75 1369w\" /></p>\n<p>I’m known by my coworkers as a “tire whore” because I tend to change my tires entirely more often than necessary. I’m currently running a Teravail Sparwood/Rutland combo in 29×2.2. I’ve loved the Cannonball/Rutland combo in smaller widths for years, so this was the natural choice to start us off. Ultradynamico and Rene Herse are probably next on the list.</p>\n<p>The <em><a href=\"https://instagram.com/seekmtb\" target=\"_blank\">SEEK MTB</a></em> carbon wheels were built by hand here in Spokane by my good friend Josh, and this is the second set I’ve bought from him. Second only to tires and contact points, I speculate that wheels may be the most noticeable upgrade one can make to a bicycle. Going from 19mm internal to 25mm increased air volume and gave the tires a rounder profile; they are lighter, more efficient, and I find it easier to keep the wheels spinning on longer days.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1727\" height=\"1151\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-17.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-17.jpg?w=1727&amp;quality=75 1727w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-17.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-17.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-17.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-17.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-17.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>This reiteration has taken the Sawyer from the dusty corner of my shop to the daily driver, mainly being ridden to/from work with bigger stuff on the weekends. We recently completed a 135-mile “full spectrum” ride and it passed with flying colors so I’m excited to see what other shenanigans we get into together.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2136\" height=\"1428\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-4.jpg?w=2136&amp;quality=75 2136w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-4.jpg?resize=1024,685&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-4.jpg?resize=2000,1337&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-4.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-4.jpg?resize=1800,1203&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-4.jpg?resize=1335,893&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-4.jpg?resize=700,468&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-4.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Sawyer-4.jpg?resize=2048,1369&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><em>It’s my opinion that if you don’t park your bike, get like 10 feet away, and instinctively turn back around to look at it, you’re riding the wrong bike. </em></p>\n<p>I’m not racing nor do I have any real interest in doing it, so I mostly try to avoid getting caught up in the tornado of performance and efficiency, electronic bits that make cool noises, and whatever else the industry thinks I need. I’m a simple guy who likes simple things, and I feel the most important part of any bicycle is that it makes its owner smile, not necessarily anyone else.</p>\n<p>That being said, one thing I’ve noticed is that this bike gets A LOT of attention wherever I go. Some people know what it is, some don’t. At the coffee shop, parked at a gas station, on the paved bike path, and in the woods, it’s always a similar conversation.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2136\" height=\"1428\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/First-Build.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/First-Build.jpg?w=2136&amp;quality=75 2136w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/First-Build.jpg?resize=1024,685&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/First-Build.jpg?resize=2000,1337&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/First-Build.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/First-Build.jpg?resize=1800,1203&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/First-Build.jpg?resize=1335,893&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/First-Build.jpg?resize=700,468&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/First-Build.jpg?resize=1536,1027&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/First-Build.jpg?resize=2048,1369&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><em><strong>“Nice to meet you.
