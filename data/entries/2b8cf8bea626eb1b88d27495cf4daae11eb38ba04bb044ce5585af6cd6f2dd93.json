In most countries, the devices also continue to support eSIM as well, allowing for dual-SIM functionality with cellular networks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/07/iphone-14-models-no-sim-card-tray-us/\">removed the SIM card tray from all iPhone 14 models</a> in the U.S. last year, forcing customers to use an eSIM, a digital SIM that allows users to activate a cellular plan without having to use a physical nano-SIM card. Apple has a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209096\">support document</a> with a list of carriers that support eSIM technology around the world.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen the iPhone 14 series launched in the U.S., <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/14/apple-promotes-esim-benefits-for-iphone/\">Apple promoted eSIMs</a> as being more secure than a physical SIM since they cannot be removed from an iPhone that is lost or stolen. Apple added that up to eight eSIMs can be managed in the iPhone's Settings app, eliminating the need to obtain, carry, and swap physical SIM cards while traveling. iPhone 13 and newer models can have two eSIMs active at the same time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith eSIM availability expanding, the SIM card tray might eventually be removed from iPhones sold outside of the U.S., but for now it lives another year.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/\">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-still-has-sim-card-tray-outside-us/\">iPhone 15 Models Sold Outside U.S. Still Have Physical SIM Card Tray</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-models-sold-outside-u-s-still-have-physical-sim-card-tray.2401299/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2b8cf8bea626eb1b88d27495cf4daae11eb38ba04bb044ce5585af6cd6f2dd93","category":"Apple"}
