Power</a> shows that U.S. consumers continue to prefer vehicles with support for Apple CarPlay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-CarPlay-Dash.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe market research firm's annual U.S. Automotive Performance, Execution, and Layout (APEAL) Study found overall satisfaction with in-vehicle infotainment systems to average 805 on a 1,000-point scale. However, satisfaction was higher among owners who use Android Auto (832), and even higher for those who use CarPlay (840). \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe study is based on responses from 99,144 owners of new 2024 model-year vehicles in the U.S. who were surveyed after 90 days of ownership, according to J.D. Power. The study was conducted from July 2023 through May 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCarPlay has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/04/12/apple-carplay-android-auto-owner-satisfaction/\">routinely fared well</a> in vehicle satisfaction studies since launching in 2014, so this latest one is no surprise. However, it comes after General Motors last year controversially decided to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/general-motors-to-phase-out-apple-carplay/\">stop offering CarPlay</a> and Android Auto in its new electric vehicles, in favor of its own software system. Electric vehicle maker Rivian <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/rivian-explains-why-no-apple-carplay/\">also prefers its own software over CarPlay</a>. J.D. Power's study reinforces that these automakers are betting against a consumer preference, and it remains to be seen if they will ever reverse course.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/wwdc-2024-next-generation-carplay-images/\">next-generation version of CarPlay</a> that Apple announced in 2022 has yet to become available in any vehicles, but Apple's website says the rollout will begin this year. Next-generation CarPlay will be more deeply integrated across multiple screens in a vehicle, offer a built-in FM radio app and climate controls, and more. It will also be highly customizable, allowing automakers to tailor the design of the system to uniquely match their vehicles.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/j-d-power/\">J.D.
