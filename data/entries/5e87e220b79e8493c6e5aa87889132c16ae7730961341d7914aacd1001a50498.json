Parent company Embracer Group said the studio will be closed \"effective immediately\" as part of a massive restructuring program that began in June, according to a farewell notice <a href=\"https://www.volitiongames.com/news/farewell/\">posted on Volition's website</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/volition_an-update-from-volition-activity-7103051392797351936-hkgT\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n<p>\"The Volition team has proudly created world-class entertainment for fans around the globe for 30 years,\" the statement reads, in part. \"We've been driven by a passion for our community and always worked to deliver joy, surprise and delight.\"</p>\n<p>Some of Volition's more than 200 employees are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smb_ryan/status/1697281661543616857\">sharing news of their layoffs</a>. But it's unclear just how many of the studio's more than 200 employees are now out of a job and how many will be transitioned to other parts of Embracer's gaming behemoth, which includes Gearbox Entertainment, THQ Nordic, Eidos Interactive, and many more studios.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964856#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964856&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5e87e220b79e8493c6e5aa87889132c16ae7730961341d7914aacd1001a50498","category":"Tech"}
