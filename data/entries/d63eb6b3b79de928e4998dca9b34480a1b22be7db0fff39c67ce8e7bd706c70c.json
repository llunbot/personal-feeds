The defense is commonly known as MotW, short for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_Web\">Mark of the Web</a>. It works by placing a “Zone.Identifier” tag on all files downloaded from the Internet or from a networked share. This tag, a type of NTFS Alternate Data Stream and in the form of a ZoneID=3, subjects the file to additional scrutiny from Windows Defender SmartScreen and restrictions on how or when it can be executed.</p>\n<h2>There’s an archive in my archive</h2>\n<p>The 7-Zip vulnerability allowed the Russian cybercrime group to bypass those protections. Exploits worked by embedding an executable file within an archive and then embedding the archive into another archive. While the outer archive carried the MotW tag, the inner one did not. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-0411, was fixed with the release of version 24.09 in late November.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/7-zip-0-day-was-exploited-in-russias-ongoing-invasion-of-ukraine/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/7-zip-0-day-was-exploited-in-russias-ongoing-invasion-of-ukraine/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d63eb6b3b79de928e4998dca9b34480a1b22be7db0fff39c67ce8e7bd706c70c","category":"Tech"}
