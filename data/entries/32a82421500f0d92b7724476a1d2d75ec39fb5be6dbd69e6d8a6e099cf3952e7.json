The Copilot+ parts won’t run on those current PCs, but they’ll still get new features and benefit from Microsoft’s work on the operating system’s underpinnings.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032110#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032110&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"32a82421500f0d92b7724476a1d2d75ec39fb5be6dbd69e6d8a6e099cf3952e7","category":"Tech"}
