Art direction notwithstanding, <em>Diablo 3</em> ended up in a good place, and I played a ton of it, largely due to its genre-leading combat. (Lest we forget, <em>Diablo 2 </em>also had a game-changing expansion in <em>Lord of Destruction</em>.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942623#p3\">Read 43 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942623&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Aaron Zimmerman","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a6c69c3ab5691fd9b578624719636c4b17b096fa04c7fcfea676810aab62f21e","category":"Tech"}
