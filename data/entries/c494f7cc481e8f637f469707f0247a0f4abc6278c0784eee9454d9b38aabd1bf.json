The new Orox Adventure Cargo Bike is the latest eBike from Tern and their first venture into true offroad adventure bike territory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cargo and adventure are two of my favorite bike-type words… whether used together or apart. Using those words together sparks my imagination. Where a bike like the Orox can go and what it can do? Let’s get into it and find out. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family-on-the-go.jpeg\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family-on-the-go.jpeg\" alt=\"Orox Adventure Cargo Bike family on the go\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family-on-the-go.jpeg 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family-on-the-go-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family-on-the-go-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family-on-the-go-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family-on-the-go-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family-on-the-go-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Tern Bicycles)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tern says the Orox was specifically designed to navigate any terrain and weather conditions with ease. It’s optimized to haul a passenger, a pet, plus all of your adventure gear. It has dual battery capacity and an efficient Bosch motor. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family.jpeg\" alt=\"Orox Adventure Cargo Bike family\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-family-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Using two 800wh batteries gives the Orox a possible range of more than 300km….that’s about 186 miles for the countries that are scared of the metric system. All metric system jokes aside, that kind of range opens the door to all kinds of epic shenanigans on this bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Word From Tern</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Six years ago, we introduced the GSD with the belief that a compact and easy-to-ride bike capable of carrying passengers and cargo would get people out of their cars and onto bikes</em>, says Josh Hon, Tern Team Captain. “<em>We were right, and we love seeing all the amazing things people are doing with the GSD in crowded cities. But we also realized that there are plenty of places people want to go that are unpaved. And they want to bring their gear. For those trips, we made the Orox</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Orox, a Go-Anywhere, 4-Season Adventure Cargo Bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-out-there.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-out-there.jpeg\" alt=\"Orox Adventure Cargo Bike out there\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-out-there.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-out-there-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-out-there-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-out-there-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-out-there-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-out-there-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some users of both cargo bikes and adventure-specific bikes may have experienced some limitations with their particular bicycles. For instance, there aren’t many, if any, legit cargo bikes that can go deep into the backcountry. In contrast, an off-road bicycle can’t carry the substantial load of a full-fledged cargo bike, which leaves you picking and choosing what to pack for your next adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-on-rocks.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-on-rocks.jpeg\" alt=\"Orox Adventure Cargo Bike on rocks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-on-rocks.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-on-rocks-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-on-rocks-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-on-rocks-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-on-rocks-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-on-rocks-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Go Anywhere</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Orox brings cargo bike utility to all types of terrain. With its large-volume tires and powerful motor, the Orox will get you up and over any challenging terrain you throw at it. The adventure could be a potholed and poorly maintained urban street, a quick S24O (sub-24-hour overnighter) in your local State Park, or packing all of your fishing gear to fish a backcountry lake. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-shredding-the-gnar.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-shredding-the-gnar.jpeg\" alt=\"Orox Adventure Cargo Bike shredding the gnar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-shredding-the-gnar.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-shredding-the-gnar-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-shredding-the-gnar-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-shredding-the-gnar-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-shredding-the-gnar-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-shredding-the-gnar-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tern says it’s the perfect blend of a rugged MTB, a versatile trekking bike, and a utilitarian cargo bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-sloppy-condish.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-sloppy-condish.jpeg\" alt=\"Orox Adventure Cargo Bike sloppy condish\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-sloppy-condish.jpeg 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-sloppy-condish-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-sloppy-condish-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-sloppy-condish-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-sloppy-condish-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-sloppy-condish-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Go Any Time</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With extra wide tires, the Orox will inspire confidence not letting any extreme condition get in the way of your next adventure. With extreme conditions in mind, Tern has designed Orox’s frame and fork to be compatible with 26″x5″, 27.5″x4″, or a 29″ x3″ tire combos. Heavy-duty fenders will keep the rider and the bike cleaner when the adventure gets sloppy. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-frame-pack.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-frame-pack.jpeg\" alt=\"Orox Adventure Cargo Bike frame pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-frame-pack.jpeg 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-frame-pack-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-frame-pack-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-frame-pack-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-frame-pack-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-frame-pack-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Orox is ready for adventuring in colder temps too. The included frame pack not only holds some of your small essentials but acts as a battery insulator when the temp drops. So you can ride the Orox in the snow during the winter, the mud in the spring, the sand in the summer, and enjoy your favorite camp spot in the fall. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-rear-rack.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-rear-rack.jpeg\" alt=\"Orox Adventure Cargo Bike rear rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-rear-rack.jpeg 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-rear-rack-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-rear-rack-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-rear-rack-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-rear-rack-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-rear-rack-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-tires.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-tires.jpeg\" alt=\"Orox Adventure Cargo Bike tires\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-tires.jpeg 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-tires-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-tires-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-tires-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-tires-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-tires-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bring it All</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a heavy-duty hauler, the Orox has a max on-road gross vehicle weight of a whooping 210kg (again, for the metric challenged, that’s 462lbs), and “an unmatched” off-road GVW of 180kg (397lbs). So, get your kids to school in the morning with ease, and scoot to dinner with your partner in the evening. On the weekends pack the Orox up with more creature comforts like that extra six-pack, your second tackle box, or your new cast iron skillet, and hit the backcountry without a worry. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-bikepacking.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-bikepacking.jpeg\" alt=\"Orox Adventure Cargo Bike bikepacking\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-bikepacking.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-bikepacking-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-bikepacking-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-bikepacking-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-bikepacking-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-bikepacking-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Inclusive Design</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tern team designed the Orox to fit a wide range of riders. With special adjustments to frame geometry and component choice, the large size can fit riders up to 195cm (6’5″) and 130kg (286lb) in weight. For the smaller riders, the medium-sized Orox uses a mid-step frame design that allows riders from 155cm (5’1″) tall to fit and be comfy. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Built for Work (if you must)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Orox makes an ideal vehicle for organizations and businesses that need to move people and gear to tough-to-reach places. With Tern’s commitment to their <a href=\"https://bikesforbusiness.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bikes for Business program</a> and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tern-bikes-business-e-cargo-bike-solutions/\" target=\"_blank\">cargo bike</a> in general, they know a thing or two about the subject. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ornox is a bike that is purpose-built to get the job done. That could mean shovels and chainsaws for trail building/maintenance. Or medical equipment for EMTs and sporting events and festival-style concerts, to safety equipment for first responders. The Orox can do it.   </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Orox-Adventure-Cargo-Bike-granite-color.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"960\"
