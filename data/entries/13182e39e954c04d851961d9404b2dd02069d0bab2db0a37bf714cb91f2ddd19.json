Stamp on the pedals and the sprags wedge between the hub and driver at any point, providing quicker engagement than pawl- or ratchet-based hubs.</p>\n<p>The hubs also use floating axles to separate the drive forces from load. This further reduces drag when freewheeling. From my initial testing, they spin very freely in your hand and on the bike.</p>\n<p>The downside is the sprag clutch is heavier than other freehub systems, so the Vesper rear hub is not the lightest around. The hook flange version in the Berd spoke wheelset weighs a claimed 371g.</p>\n<p>This is 106g more than a J-bend Industry Nine Hydra hub, the closest you’ll get in terms of engagement speed.</p>\n<h2>Impact-resistant rims</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"NOBL mountain bike rim.\" title=\"Berd spoke wheels first look (5 of 12)\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The TR35 G2 rim uses NOBL’s Sinewave technology.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The TR35 G2 is NOBL’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cross-country-racing-guide/\">cross-country</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downcountry-mountain-bikes/\">downcountry</a> and trail-riding carbon fibre rim.</p>\n<p>The rim uses NOBL’s Sinewave technology, where the nipple beds are raised compared to the rest of the rim.</p>\n<p>The Sinewave profile is said to provide the right amount of vertical compliance without adversely affecting lateral stiffness.</p>\n<p>The TR35 uses different <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rim-width-explained-for-road-bikes-mountain-bikes-and-gravel-bikes/\">internal rim widths</a> front and rear.
