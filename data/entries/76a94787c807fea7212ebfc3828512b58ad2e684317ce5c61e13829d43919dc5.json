The 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,999, with the highest-end 16-inch MacBook Pro racking up a $6,099 price tag. The new laptops, powered by either the ‌M1‌ Pro or ‌M1‌ Max chips, also introduce a completely new design, featuring smaller bezels, an all-black keyboard, redesigned internals, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs is always the case with Apple device trade-ins, the exact value will differ depending on the device's condition, when it was introduced, and its specific specifications. For customers with the MacBook Pro with the ‌M1‌ chip and 8-cores of CPU and GPU, 8GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage, Apple is offering up to $1,000 for trade-in. It seems as though that the amount of RAM the MacBook has does not impact the trade-in value a customer is ultimately quoted.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCustomers can use Apple's interactive trade-in panel during checkout for a new MacBook Pro to get the exact trade-in value their device has.
