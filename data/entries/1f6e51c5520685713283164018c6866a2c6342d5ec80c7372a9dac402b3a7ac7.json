Running on a speedy A14 Bionic chip, this tablet will easily go from one app to another, load games in no time, and allow you to have a great time whatever you choose to do while using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display is absolutely gorgeous, with vivid colors and deep contrast. It’s also pretty bright, so it will do well even when you’re out and about in direct sunlight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10th-gen iPad is a super choice for those who are looking for a new tablet, but perhaps not that much of an upgrade for those who already have the 9th gen. Still, it’s a gorgeous tablet that will last you for years of updates, so go ahead and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLCWFNM/\" target=\"_blank\">get one for yourself for $299 at Amazon</a> while it’s still on sale.</p>\n\n\n<span>The 10th gen iPad is only $299</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLCWFNM/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1f6e51c5520685713283164018c6866a2c6342d5ec80c7372a9dac402b3a7ac7","category":"Apple"}
