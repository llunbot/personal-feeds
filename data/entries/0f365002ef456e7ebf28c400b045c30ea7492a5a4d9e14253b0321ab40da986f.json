The barcode replaces the traditional paper slip given by doctors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe national rollout follows a successful pilot in late 2023. Since then, over 1 million patients have used the app to view their prescriptions. Health Secretary Victoria Atkins told the <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-68133276\">BBC</a></em> the update would \"ease pressures on our hardworking pharmacists and GPs - freeing up valuable time for patients and helping to cut waiting lists.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new functionality allows patients to see the medication prescribed, the prescription type (repeat or one-off), and who the prescribing professional is. Patients who don't have a nominated pharmacy can generate a prescription barcode for collection. The app also now shows average local hospital waiting times for elective treatment, such as hip replacements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Accessing Digital Prescriptions in the NHS App</h2>\r<br />\n<ol><li>Tap <strong>your health</strong> at the bottom of the screen</li>\r<br />\n<li>Select <strong>view and manage prescriptions</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Select <strong>Your approved prescriptions</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap the green button on the prescription you want to view.</li>\r<br />\n</ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/how-to-nhs-app-digital-prescriptions.jpg\" alt=\"nhs app\" width=\"1284\" height=\"841\" />\r<br />\nNHS Digital says future developments for the service are now being explored, including prescription tracking to tell patients when medications are ready for collection. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/07/03/nhs-mobile-app-book-doctor-appointments/\">Announced in 2018</a>, the NHS Digital app allows more than 33 million registered users to view their health record from their GP and manage hospital appointments.
