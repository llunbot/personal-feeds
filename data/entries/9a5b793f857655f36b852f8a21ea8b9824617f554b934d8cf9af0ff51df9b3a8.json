There have been four feature films, plus the animated series <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_Island_(TV_series)\">Skull Island</a>, </em>which debuted on Netflix earlier this year, and Apple TV+'s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch:_Legacy_of_Monsters\"><em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em></a>, which debuted last month and picked up where the 2014 film <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3P9bwaX\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Godzilla</em></a> left off. (The season finale will air on January 12, 2024.) And now we have the official trailer for the next film installment—<em>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</em>—unveiled during CCXP in Sao Paulo, Brazil, over the weekend.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> below.)</strong></p>\n<p>Directed by Adam Wingard, <em>Godzilla x Kong</em> picks up sometime after its 2021 predecessor. <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> showcased not only a major showdown between its titular titans—in which Godzilla emerged the victor—but also the two teaming up in the climactic finale to take out Mechagodzilla, a telepathically controlled creature with the severed head of Ghidorah. Ghidorah's consciousness took over when Mechagodzilla was activated, and it took both Kong and Godzilla (plus some timely help from humans) to defeat him. (Kong got the final honors, although Godzilla charged the killing ax—made from one of his dorsal plates—with his atomic breath.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988215#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988215&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9a5b793f857655f36b852f8a21ea8b9824617f554b934d8cf9af0ff51df9b3a8","category":"Tech"}
