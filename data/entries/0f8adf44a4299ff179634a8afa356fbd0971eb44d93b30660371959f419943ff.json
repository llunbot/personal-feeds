Apple released iOS 18.2 a week ago on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-ios-18-2-update/\">December 11</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/ios-18-1-1-security-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2228\" height=\"1253\" />\r<br />\nApple often stops signing an older version of iOS, usually within a week or two after a new version is released. When an update is no longer signed, it can't be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis policy encourages users to keep their operating systems up to date, ensuring they have the latest security enhancements. Apple also stopped signing iOS 17.7.2 on Wednesday.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iOS 18.1.1 update provided <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-releases-ios-18-1-1-and-ipados-18-1-1/\">important security fixes</a>, but no other notable changes.
