SuperSix Evo on the Tacx Neo 3M smart trainer\" title=\"Tacx NEO 3M hero image\" />                                            <p>Tacx has announced the Neo 3M, its latest flagship smart trainer.</p>\n<p>Building upon the highly rated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/resistance-trainer/tacx-neo-2t-smart-review/\">Neo 2T</a>, one of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\">best smart trainers</a> available, the Neo 3M adds integrated fore-aft movement.</p>\n<p>Tacx also says the Neo 3M features “enhanced accuracy and power… across a broader range of power outputs”.</p>\n<p>As with the Neo 2T, the Neo 3M is a direct-drive smart trainer that uses an electromagnetic motor braking system.</p>\n<p>Tacx says this enables it to create a virtual flywheel of variable weight, leading to a more realistic ride feel.</p>\n<p>The Tacx Neo 3M is available now for £1,749.99 / €1,999.99 / $1,999.99.</p>\n<h2>Moving with the times</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\"

movement and includes a front-wheel riser block with a similar function.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tacx</i></span></div>\n<p>With virtual indoor cycling apps becoming increasingly advanced, smart trainer manufacturers are also looking for ways to improve the ride feel of static trainers.</p>\n<p>Wahoo, for example, recently launched its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/wahoo-kickr-move-review/\">Kickr Move</a> smart trainer, which features around 20cm/8in inches of fore-aft movement along an integrated, slightly curved track.</p>\n<p>The Tacx Neo 3M takes inspiration from the Tacx Neo Motion Plates – an optional accessory for the Neo 2T, which provided around 5cm / 2in of fore-aft movement (and cost £259.99 / $299.99 / €299.99).</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tacx Neo Motion Plates\" title=\"Tacx Neo Motion Plates\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Tacx Neo Motion Plates (pictured here) have essentially been built in to the Neo 3M.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tacx</i></span></div>\n<p>This time, though, the movement is built directly in to the Neo 3M, as is an unspecified amount of “natural side-to-side flexion”.</p>\n<p>According to the brand, this helps make the ride feel more realistic and more comfortable.</p>\n<p>As with the Wahoo Kickr Move, Tacx says the added movement can be locked out if you prefer to ride without it.</p>\n<p>Tacx also includes a front-wheel riser block (compatible with tyres up to 60mm wide) with similar built-in movement, to level out your bike.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tacx Neo 3M movement lock\"

<i>Tacx</i></span></div>\n<h2>Enhanced accuracy and power, but no Wi-Fi</h2>\n<p>It’s fair to say the Neo 2T was already well regarded for its data accuracy and high power output, but Tacx says it has made improvements to these as well.</p>\n<p>Although the headline specs – 2,200 watts maximum power, 25 per cent maximum simulated gradient and +/- 1 per cent power accuracy – are identical to those of the Neo 2T, Tacx says accuracy has been improved “across a broader range of power outputs”.</p>\n<p>We’ve asked Tacx for more details on this topic and will update this article when we receive a response.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Studio shot of

<i>Tacx</i></span></div>\n<p>Unlike the Wahoo Kickr Move (and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/wahoo-kickr-v6-review/\">Kickr V6</a>), the Neo 3M doesn’t have built-in Wi-Fi connectivity.</p>\n<p>It instead makes do with built-in ANT+ and Bluetooth, and the new Tacx Smart Network Adapter, an optional dongle that enables Wi-Fi or ethernet connections.</p>\n<p>According to Tacx, this dongle can help create a “more stable connection” between the Neo 3M and your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-indoor-cycling-apps/\">indoor cycling app</a> of choice.</p>\n<p>The Tacx Smart Network Adapter can be purchased separately for £129.99 or as a bundle with the Neo 3M for £1,879.98.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\"
