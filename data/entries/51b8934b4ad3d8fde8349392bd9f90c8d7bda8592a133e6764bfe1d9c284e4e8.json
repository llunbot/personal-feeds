This stout little unit unscrews to reveal an insertion tool and five repair plugs, or tyre worms if you prefer. The inserter features a familiar two-prong design augmented by a rubber collar that you hold against the tyre as you withdraw the tool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 74g on my scales (a hair under the claimed 79g) and measuring roughly 87×40mm at its longest and widest, the TPT-1 isn’t as svelte as some rivals like <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/udog-tensione-shoes\" target=\"_blank\">the Dynaplugger</a>. However it feels very well made and the chunky head serves as an effective handle that should make it easier to use. Also, it’s anodised blue, so it must be good.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.Park-Tool-TPT-1-Tubeless-Tyre-Plug-Tool_248609.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz (£44.99)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Quad Lock phone mounts and accessories</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/quad-lock-mounts-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Phone case and mount, plus wireless charging pad\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/quad-lock-mounts-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/quad-lock-mounts-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/quad-lock-mounts-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/quad-lock-mounts-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/quad-lock-mounts-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/quad-lock-mounts-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/quad-lock-mounts-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/quad-lock-mounts-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/quad-lock-mounts-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/quad-lock-mounts.jpg 1940w\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you like attaching your phone to things?

Quad Lock might be for you. (Older readers: Vinted is an app where you sell your old clothes using hot selfies. Younger readers: JNCOs are like regular jeans but much, much radder.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quad Lock’s signature product is a mount that’s a bit like a Garmin quarter-turn, but in reverse – the male end (not pictured – there are countless variants) is the mounting bracket, while the female attaches to your phone or is integrated into a phone case.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/gallery_adv/are-wider-tyres-faster\">Are wider tyres faster?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-weight-limit\">What is the UCI weight limit?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\">Best of the best gravel bikes 2023: Cyclist’s top-rated gravel and adventure bikes</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Quad Lock offers cases to fit popular models of phone from £15.99, or you can stick the universal mount to pretty much any device.

The NH500s are comfortable, lightweight trousers made from a polyester/cotton blend that’s stretchy for freedom of movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While they’re aimed at walking (sorry, hiking), I reckon they’ll be a great option for cycle commuters who want something semi-respectable looking that won’t chafe horribly on the bike. These trousers aren’t water resistant, but the fabric is designed to be quick-drying and feels just right for spring mornings when it’s chilly but not cold.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/decathlon-quechua-nh500-slim-trousers-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Elasticated ankle\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/decathlon-quechua-nh500-slim-trousers-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/decathlon-quechua-nh500-slim-trousers-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/decathlon-quechua-nh500-slim-trousers-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/decathlon-quechua-nh500-slim-trousers-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/decathlon-quechua-nh500-slim-trousers-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/decathlon-quechua-nh500-slim-trousers-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/decathlon-quechua-nh500-slim-trousers-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/decathlon-quechua-nh500-slim-trousers-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/decathlon-quechua-nh500-slim-trousers-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/decathlon-quechua-nh500-slim-trousers-3.jpg 1940w\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The NH500s are very keenly priced and they have a useful array of pockets.

The new suit combination will become the brand’s flagship outfit, replacing the very successful Nopinz Flow Suit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-new Hypersonic TT skinsuit is specifically designed to be paired with the company’s new aero base layer and is the result of extensive market research and wind tunnel testing. The suit is made from specially chosen fabrics that maximise the effect of the aero base layer, which is designed to be worn underneath the Hypersonic suit. This combination will save between 11 and 19 watts over the Flow Suit at 49 kph, across yaw angles of 0, 4 and 7 degrees. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new aero base layer features a full-length body and a practical key storage pocket, and it can also be purchased separately if you wish to pair it with an existing suit. Optional Hypersonic overshoes are available for those wishing to maximise aerodynamic savings.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://nopinz.com/product-tag/hypersonic/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Shop the Hypersonic range at Nopinz</strong></a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Ad feature ends</strong></em></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into this week: Sensational audio drama</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"768\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/this-thing-of-darkness-drama.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/this-thing-of-darkness-drama.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/this-thing-of-darkness-drama-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/this-thing-of-darkness-drama-750x422.jpeg 750w\" /><figcaption>BBC</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A straw poll of my colleagues suggests that not only do none of them listen to audio drama (or fiction podcasts, if you prefer), but some of them are barely even aware the genre exists. As someone raised to a soundtrack of Radio 4, this baffles and saddens me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great audio is one of life’s true pleasures, to my mind one of the purest ways to be immersed in a story. The explosion of podcasting means more good content is available than ever before, but organisations like the BBC have been producing high quality drama for decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Thing of Darkness</em> is told from the perspective of a forensic psychologist played by the brilliant Lolita Chakrabarti, who works with both the victims and perpetrators of violent crimes. Each series – there are two – follows a single story arc, slowing unravelling the crime and the impact on those affected. It’s gripping, chilling and fascinating in equal measure. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000fpn9\" target=\"_blank\">Listen on the BBC</a>, or wherever you get your podcasts.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/park-tool-tpt-1-tubeless-tyre-plug-tool\">In the Drops: Park Tool tubeless repair, Quad Lock phone mounts, Decathlon trousers and unmissable audio</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Matthew Loveridge &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"51b8934b4ad3d8fde8349392bd9f90c8d7bda8592a133e6764bfe1d9c284e4e8","category":"Cycling"}
