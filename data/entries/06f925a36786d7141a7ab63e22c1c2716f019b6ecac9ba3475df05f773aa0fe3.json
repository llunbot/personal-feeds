As with previous Pride styles, it's likely the watch face will animate when interacted with.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe images were discovered on Apple's servers by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1651016974372151297?s=20\">@aaronp613 and @nicolas09F9</a>, before being swiftly pulled, suggesting Apple unintentionally made them accessible on its back end. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple participates in the San Francisco Pride Parade every year in support of the LGBTQ community. Apple employees march in the parade, Apple creates dedicated t-shirts, and also hosts other celebrations throughout the month of June.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple announced its last Pride band designs in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/24/apple-watch-2022-pride-edition-bands/\">May 2022</a>, with new Pride Edition Sport Loop and Pride Edition Nike Sport Loop options available.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pride/\">Pride</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/26/2023-apple-watch-price-face-band/\">2023 Apple Watch Pride Edition Face and Band Unearthed in Code</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"06f925a36786d7141a7ab63e22c1c2716f019b6ecac9ba3475df05f773aa0fe3","category":"Apple"}
