Luffy in <em>One Piece</em>, the Netflix live-action adaptation of the popular Japanese manga and anime franchise. </p></div>\n<p>Netflix has a mixed track record when it comes to adapting beloved Japanese anime series into live-action formats. I liked 2021's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/review-reimagined-cowboy-bebop-largely-preserves-beloved-elements-of-original/\"><em>Cowboy Bebop</em></a> more than most diehard fans—just for the pitch-perfect casting alone, despite the fact that the fight choreography left a lot to be desired. It was certainly better than the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist_(film)\">live-action versions</a> of <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em> (another of my personal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist_(TV_series)\">anime faves</a>), but Netflix opted not to renew <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>. So we'll never know if it would have worked out its issues, although the cameo appearance tacked onto the finale of a particularly grating version of Radical Ed didn't bode well.</p>\n<p>Given that checkered history, one could be forgiven for feelings of trepidation about the streaming platform's forthcoming live-action series adaptation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece_(2023_TV_series)\"><em>One Piece</em></a>, a hugely popular manga and anime series created by Eiichiro Oda. Who doesn't love pirates? The first trailer debuted at San Diego Comic-Con, and honestly, the live-action series looks great. Then again, so did the trailers for <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>.</p>\n<p>The original <em>One Piece</em> manga debuted in 1997, following the adventures of one Monkey D. Luffy, who heads a motley crew called the Straw Hat Pirates. There's swordsman Roronoa Zoro, thief and navigator Nami, sniper and compulsive liar Usopp, and a cook named Sanji. They're searching for the legendary One Piece, a mythical treasure that would make anyone who possesses it King of the Pirates. Monkey wants to be the Pirate King, but so do a host of other pirates with their own ships and crews.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955937#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955937&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8ffc358b620ba3846a8f2e79edd3c62f2f5b7bf6d20134484511456d34efed3b","category":"Tech"}
