Similarly, the media publication Payload <a href=\"https://payloadspace.com/estimating-spacexs-2024-revenue/\">estimated</a> that Starlink generated $8.2 billion in revenue last year.</p>\n<p>These estimates indicate that Starlink produced a few hundred million dollars in free cash flow for SpaceX in 2024. However, with revenues expected to leap in 2025 to above $12 billion, Quilty Space estimates that free cash flow will grow to about $2 billion. SpaceX is privately held, so its financial numbers are not public.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/starlink-profit-growing-rapidly-as-it-faces-a-moment-of-promise-and-peril/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/starlink-profit-growing-rapidly-as-it-faces-a-moment-of-promise-and-peril/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"750d63c099f9c97762f77b6e19f4c88740e2889ee9a5cd7f5bc4e5bd48683aff","category":"Tech"}
