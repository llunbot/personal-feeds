Most of the time, you don’t — you stumble around for \nawhile, exploring uncertainly until, slowly, things start to make \nsense. That messy journey is all part of the process. Designer \nDamien Newman and I have teamed up with Cotton Bureau to make some \nt-shirts featuring his Design Squiggle that illustrate this untidy \npattern of creativity. The Process Tee is available in two \nvarieties — <a href=\"https://cottonbureau.com/p/9EMACZ/shirt/the-process\">light design on dark fabric</a> and <a href=\"https://cottonbureau.com/p/2U564K/shirt/the-process-light\">dark design \non light fabric</a> — and 50% of the profits will be donated to \na charitable organization (more on that below). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Love it. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/05/01/newman-squiggle\">I previously linked to Newman’s squiggle</a> way back in May 2020.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/04/the-process-tee\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"03f945ceb308eb358da956da994ad849f44b13b5c0b91f19a305c7c2b5753df0","category":"Tech"}
