Nvidia says the new gaming experience rivals the latest game consoles.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEach GeForce NOW cloud SuperPOD includes more than 1000 GPUs that deliver over 39 petaflops of graphics horsepower. Nvidia says each instance is 35 teraflops of performance, nearly 3x that of an Xbox Series X.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith the new membership tier, games can run at up to 1440p on Macs and PCs, and at up to 120 frames per second.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccess to the GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership is priced at $99.99 for six months, which is introductory pricing. GeForce NOW founders and Priority members have early access to pre-order starting today, and pre-orders will open more broadly to all gamers later in the month. Quantities are limited.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAt $99.99 for six months, access to the RTX 3080 rigs costs twice as much as the $49.99 priority membership. Those who choose the highest-tier plan get longer session allowances in addition to the higher quality streaming.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGeForce NOW offers several free games, but for the most part, titles need to be purchased to be played. GeForce NOW provides the gaming platform, but gamers need to supply their own games.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nvidia/\">Nvidia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geforce-now/\">geforce now</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/21/geforce-now-high-performance-tier/\">Nvidia Announces New High-Performance Membership Tier for GeForce NOW</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nvidia-announces-new-high-performance-membership-tier-for-geforce-now.2318417/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9Y5Cah-DjqY:2UMCFqE1Dwc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9Y5Cah-DjqY:2UMCFqE1Dwc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/9Y5Cah-DjqY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ac71d30ae460a21a60d1d6d301056be4edb59aafdfaff44f6b32ce72f7ff07ca","category":"Apple"}
