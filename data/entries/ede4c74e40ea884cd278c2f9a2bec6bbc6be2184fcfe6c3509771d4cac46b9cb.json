Now, data contained in some new Valve game updates suggests that the project, known in Valve engine code as \"HLX\"—and widely assumed to be <em>Half-Life 3</em>—might be reaching the final stages of production.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lGdUBMdQ94\">a new video</a>, longtime Valve watcher Tyler McVicker goes into detail on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_5MAtbJ0u_O7WxgBKVDnzHeOlUeiFS2EnVLZtF9Lf_M/edit?tab=t.0\">a bevy of new variables and strings</a> found after spending hours data-mining the latest update to <em>Dota 2</em> (the first update for that game since mid-December). The strings suggest a wave of behind-the-scenes Source engine changes dealing with the kind of \"optimization and polish\" that \"happen[s] at the end of a game's production cycle,\" McVicker says. \"This is getting to the point where it does feel as if Valve is nearing completion of the production of HLX.\"</p>\n<div><div></div><div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      Tyler McVicker goes over all the new data-mined evidence that \"HLX\" development is wrapping up.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Those changes include a set of new code in <a href=\"https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-Dota2/blob/master/game/core/ai_basenpc.fgd#L299\">a file called AI_baseNPC.fgd</a>, which is not actively used by <em>Dota 2</em> and includes many circumstantial <em>Half-Life</em> references (e.g. \"machinery,\" \"alien blood\"). The <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1it7t3o/new_ai_optimization_for_hlx_link_explanation_in/\">specific code in this latest update</a> deals with letting the engine scale the level of an NPC's AI simulation based on its distance from the player, a refinement that McVicker says is \"absolutely... optimization work\" and an apparent sign that \"Valve has hit the optimization and polish phase\" on HLX.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/fresh-leaks-suggest-half-life-3-development-may-be-nearing-completion/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/fresh-leaks-suggest-half-life-3-development-may-be-nearing-completion/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ede4c74e40ea884cd278c2f9a2bec6bbc6be2184fcfe6c3509771d4cac46b9cb","category":"Tech"}
