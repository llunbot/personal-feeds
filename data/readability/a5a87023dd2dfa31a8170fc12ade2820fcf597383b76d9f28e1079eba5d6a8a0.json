Maybe by swapping out the drive system from a 20mph-max Class I motor to a 28mph-max Class III motor? Or fiddling with the settings or other components? Well, hold your horses, because we’re about to explain why it’s a lot more complicated than just switching parts.</p><p>For this article, we spoke with the experts at Bosch and Shimano (as well as the product manager for Marin Bikes) for answers, but it’s highly likely that the info here translates across Brose, Fazua, Yamaha, and more. As for hot-rodding your Specialized e-bike? You can probably forget it since they use completely customized shapes and software on their e-bikes.</p><h2>Can I upgrade the motor from Class 1 to Class 3?</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:740x555/rscb28/ng:webp/ngcb28\" alt=\"bosch e-bike motor on a cargo bike\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6-297x223.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6-800x600.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6-120x90.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6-768x576.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6-1536x1152.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:740x555/rscb28/ng:webp/ngcb28\" ezoid=\"0.19761758162292642\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6-297x223.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6-800x600.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6-120x90.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6-768x576.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27160437/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-6-1536x1152.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb28 1536w\"></a></p><p>In a perfect world, you could simply upgrade your motor to a more powerful one.

Sometimes the new drive unit will fit but leave a gap, but sometimes it just won’t fit. There isn’t really any go to information source to find out if a drive unit will fit an existing frame. The bike brand may know, but in many cases, no one has ever checked to see if a new drive unit will fit an old frame.”</p><p>And here’s Marin’s take:</p><p>“The Marin Alpine Trail E (which gets E7000, E8000, and EP8 spec, depending on the model) will all fit on the same motor mount, but you’d have to have it reprogrammed,” says product manager Matthew Cipes. “And since the bike is built to handle the higher powered motors, it’s no problem upgrading, but you’re only gaining more torque, not more speed…they’re all tuned and programmed to be Class 1 bikes.”</p><p>“While you might be able to come across a Class 3 EP8 motor, and it might fit, Marin wouldn’t approve such an upgrade. And here’s why: Because we design our bikes to handle the torque and power of a Class 1 motor, so we can’t guarantee that it would be safe. Perhaps the new motor would torque the frame too much. Or it could overpower the brakes.”</p><h2>What about changing the chainring size on an e-bike?</h2><div id=\"attachment_224538\"><p><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-224538\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09.jpg\" alt=\"stock spicy curry motor and chainring\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yuba-spicy-curry-e-cargo-bike-review-specs-09-630x420.jpg 630w\"></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-224538\">This is the stock 20-tooth chainring that came on our Yuba Spicy Curry.</p></div><p>We did this, and it didn’t work out well.

Since the speed sensor uses the rear wheel’s rotation to determine speed based on the wheel and tire size parameters from the bike brand, then increasing the diameter of your wheel will make your e-bike faster for a given amount of motor output.</p><p>But…unless your bike comes with, say, a 26″ wheel but magically has room for a 29er wheel, then changing your wheel size is not practical…or likely possible. Bikes are purpose-built for a particular wheel size and are not generally able to accept a larger wheel.</p><p>You could put a <em>smaller</em> wheel in there, though. Which might improve your acceleration (and cause your pedals to hit the ground), but that would only be good for very, <em>very</em> short drag races… because acceleration may improve, but your top end speed would be lower.</p><h3>Couldn’t you just move the sensor?</h3><p>Moving the wheel speed sensor and magnet further in or out won’t make any difference because they’re still going to pass by each other at the same rate.

If the bigger battery will fit without hitting the top tube or shock, it’s a smart upgrade.”</p><p>“One very important piece of information though is that the new 630Wh battery required an upgrade to the battery mount to handle the extra weight (BM-E8016 vs the original BM-E8010). If someone wants to use that bigger battery on a bike that came with a smaller battery they will need to upgrade to the stronger mount.”</p><p>“Internal batteries can only be upgraded to a larger capacity in one case. We make one battery that is a 504 Wh battery in a 630 Wh case.

The 504Wh BT-E8035-L can be upgraded to 630Wh BT-E8036, but BT-E8035 is a shorter battery with mounts that are closer together so it can’t be upgraded.”</p><div id=\"attachment_239628\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-239628\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Niner RIP e9 e-mountain bike review and tech details\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/niner-RIP-e9-eMTB-review-tech-details-13-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-239628\">Sometimes even the frame accessories are custom fit to a specific motor, too.</p></div><p>All that said, on complete e-bikes sold through legitimate channels, swapping to a bigger battery is only going to increase your <em>range</em>, not your <em>speed</em>. That’s mainly because the software and motor are both designed to work with a certain wattage and amperage, and your battery’s output has to match that lest you damage the system.</p><p>I specify “complete e-bikes” because if you’re hacking together your own system, then yes, there are a lot of ways to make your bikes very, very fast (and illegal). But you also need to be sure the frame, wheels, and brakes can handle the speed.</p><p>That’s important: Unless a bike brand is using the same frame on both low- and high-power models, their frames, chains, and drivetrains might not be able to handle the torque over the long term.</p><h2>What upgrades can I make on my own?</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27180955/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-14.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27180955/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27180955/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-14.jpg 1400w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27180955/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-14-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27180955/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-14-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27180955/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-14-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27180955/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-14-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27180955/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-14.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27180955/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-14.jpg 1400w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27180955/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-14-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27180955/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-14-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27180955/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-14-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27180955/how-to-upgrade-e-bike-motors-to-make-them-faster-14-768x576.jpg 768w\"></a></p><p>Charging speed is a big one. Many Bosch bikes ship with their 2A compact charger, because it’s less expensive. If you were the product manager for a bike brand and you could save money on the charger that’s included and put that money into better spec on the bike so it looks better on the showroom, wouldn’t you?</p><p>But Bosch offers a more powerful 4A standard charger that cuts your charging time <em>almost</em> in half. For their popular PowerTube 500 battery, a complete charge goes from 7.5 hours down to 4.5 hours just by using the more powerful charger.
