I had a package to ship, and wouldn’t you know it, just as I stepped out of the Airbnb, the heavens open up and rain poured down. But, you know what? I didn’t care. I was stoked to feel those cobblestone streets under my tires, hear the gears shifting, and feel the wind hitting my face. Then, pedaling along, I spotted a bike shop out of the corner of my eye. Three blocks down the road, rain coming down, I made a U-turn—there was something about that shop that just grabbed my attention. I had to check it out.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit16.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit16.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit16.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit16.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit16.jpg?resize=1800,1202&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit16.jpg?resize=1335,891&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit16.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit16.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit26.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit26.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit26.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit26.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit26.jpg?resize=1800,1202&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit26.jpg?resize=1335,891&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit26.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit26.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I parked my Gitane outside and walked into the shop, water dripping off me like crazy. Right there in the window was a Ritchey hardtail. And as I stepped inside, that familiar aroma hit me – a mix of espresso, bike grease, and fresh tires. As soon as I laid eyes on the standard wall-covered-in-gravel-bikes-and-camping-gear, I knew I’d found my shop.</p>\n<p>Rob Lawrence, one of the owners, began talking to me in French at first. I quickly apologized for not understanding, and he smoothly switched to English, adding a touch of his Southern twang. (Come to find out, he hails from Kentucky.)</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit17.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit17.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit17.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit17.jpg?resize=1800,1202&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit17.jpg?resize=1335,891&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit17.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit17.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>We got into a conversation about bike camping, handmade bicycles, and trusty steel frames. I’d finally found my tribe. Then, he mentioned that the Tour de France was rolling into town the following day. To my delight, (and turns out, typical Rob fashion) he extended an invitation to join his crew on the roadside. Our plan? Sip on some cold beers, hang out for a couple of hours, and catch the peloton whizzing by in a mere 30 seconds.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit8.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit8.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit8.jpg?resize=1800,1202&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit8.jpg?resize=1335,891&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit8.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit8.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit7.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit7.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit7.jpg?resize=1800,1202&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit7.jpg?resize=1335,891&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit7.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit7.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>And to top it off, it happened to be Rob’s birthday that very day.

Where did you come across that gem?</em></strong></p>\n<p>One day, while I was on the tram, I spotted a fellow cruising on a fixie. Without a second thought, I hopped off the tram and swiftly pursued him. I reckon he must have thought I was quite a sight, but I couldn’t contain my astonishment at encountering another individual pedaling a fixed gear bike in Prague. Patrik, as it turned out, shared the same level of excitement at meeting a fellow track bike enthusiast. That marked the beginning of a strong friendship between us.</p>\n<p>Over time, the fixie culture began to take root in Prague. We gradually started acquiring frames sourced from old Soviet-Era velodromes and teamed them up with hubs. These sought-after combos found their way to other members of the cycling community, contributing to the growing fixie movement in the city.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit77.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" alt /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit76.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit76.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit76.jpg?resize=768,576&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit76.jpg?resize=700,525&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Our first alley cat in Prague, circa 2008; Riding the abandoned Soviet-era Velodromes, also circa 2008</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit28.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit28.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit28.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit28.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit28.jpg?resize=1800,1202&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit28.jpg?resize=1335,891&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit28.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Musette-Bicycles-and-Coffee-Shop-Visit28.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>It’s quite evident that the bike polo scene is flourishing in Bordeaux. What’s your involvement with that community?</em></strong></p>\n<p>My connection with bike polo goes back to 2005 when I attended the Bicycle Film Festival in London. It was there that I witnessed the exhilarating game for the very first time. Inspired by what I saw, I was determined to introduce bike polo to Prague. Alongside a fellow enthusiast, Spencer, who hailed from NYC and had prior experience with Bike Polo, we kick-started Prague Bike Polo in no time. Our team, Praha Pistola, was born.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2010, as I arrived in Bordeaux. My search for the local fixed gear community led me to the delightful discovery that bike polo was also part of the mix. Although the polo scene in Bordeaux was still in its infancy, I teamed up with my friend Guillaume, another avid player, to establish the club. Our mission was clear: organize tournaments and scout for a permanent playing venue. Eventually, we found our spot within an abandoned army barracks, where we fashioned two courts. Today, one of those courts continues to serve the club. Interestingly, this entire army base has been remarkably transformed into an eclectic hub called Darwin, encompassing co-working spaces, a brewery, a skatepark, and event areas.
