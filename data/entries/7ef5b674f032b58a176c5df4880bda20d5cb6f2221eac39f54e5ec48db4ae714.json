There are burly all-mountain stems handling everything from big trail to enduro, and there are lightweight stems for XC bikes. But nothing in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and the current crop of XC stems haven’t really kept up with the slacker angles and longer reach of modern race bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they made the new Turbine SL stem, giving it a design that goes from XC race day to backcountry fun day and looks good doing it. Here’s what you need to know…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-3.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1466\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-3.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of race face turbine SL stem shown on a mountain bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-3.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-3-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-3-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-3-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-3-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-3-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-3-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-3-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Race Face isn’t new to making very good, strong, and durable stems. They’ve come as OEM spec on so many bikes for so many years that it’s just a no brainer to get one if/when you need to change your bike’s fit, update its looks, or upgrade from something generic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-4.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1623\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-4.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of race face turbine SL stem shown on a mountain bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-4.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-4-297x219.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-4-1536x1133.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-4-120x89.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-4-768x567.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-raceface-turbine-sl-stem-4-2048x1511.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Turbine SL is machined, just like their heavier duty Turbine R stems, except it’s made with 6000-series aluminum rather than heavier (but also stronger) 7075.

That gives you a very clean look as you gaze down from the saddle – just make sure you keep the face plate “top up” if you flip the stem, it’s designed so the logo stays on the non-drive side of the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, like all Race Face products, they come with a lifetime warranty, crashes included.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Turbine SL Stem Review</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-1.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-1.webp\" alt=\"race face turbine sl stem shown in black.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-1.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-1-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-1-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-1-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-1-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been running the new Turbine SL Stem on the all-new Ari Signal Peak. But unlike Jordan’s build, mine’s a little more downcountry with a 130mm fork on it. It’s still a light bike, with lightweight wheels and an XTR group, but paired with Eras cranks and meatier tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, the exact kind of bike Race Face designed this stem for. Unfortunately, I can’t show you closeups of the complete bike because some of those other things I mentioned aren’t released yet, but I can say that the stem is exactly what it should be.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tyler-riding-turbine-sl-stem-arizona.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1467\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tyler-riding-turbine-sl-stem-arizona.webp\" alt=\"tyler riding the new race face turbine sl stem on a desert mountain bike trail.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tyler-riding-turbine-sl-stem-arizona.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tyler-riding-turbine-sl-stem-arizona-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tyler-riding-turbine-sl-stem-arizona-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tyler-riding-turbine-sl-stem-arizona-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tyler-riding-turbine-sl-stem-arizona-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tyler-riding-turbine-sl-stem-arizona-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tyler-riding-turbine-sl-stem-arizona-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tyler-riding-turbine-sl-stem-arizona-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Go ahead, try and zoom.

Even with the very lightweight Race Face Next SL handlebar, the new Turbine SL stem kept everything stiff and stable.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-2.webp\" alt=\"race face turbine sl stem shown in black.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-2.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-2-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-2-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The clamp width is sufficient to prevent unwanted torsional flex of the handlebar, but not so wide it deadens the bar’s ability to dampen trail chatter. While the Next SL bar isn’t quite as trail tuned for vertical compliance as <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/race-face-era-turbine-handlebars/\">their Eras handlebars</a>, it does have some, and I like to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also not so wide that it encumbers out-front computer or light mounts, even those with broader clamp sections like the KOM Cycling shown above or Quad Lock’s phone mounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-3.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-3.webp\" alt=\"race face turbine sl stem shown in black.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-3.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-3-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-3-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-3-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-3-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m riding the 50mm length, but I think I’m going to switch to a 60mm – this is an XC bike, after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I don’t anticipate flipping the stem upward, I like that it has <em>any</em> negative offset at all. Many MTB stems these days, especially shorter ones, are straight, leaving you with only the steerer tube and spacers to adjust height. Or, if they do have a negative drop, they’re not designed to be flipped.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-4.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-4.webp\" alt=\"race face turbine sl stem shown in black.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-4.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-4-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-4-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-4-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review-4-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an unexpected benefit of this design – it creates a perfectly flat top in XC mode. This makes it really easy to use <a href=\"https://k-edge.com/products/adjustable-stem-mount\">K-Edge’s lightweight stem cap computer mount</a>, even the lightest ones <a href=\"https://k-edge.com/products/stem-mount\">without the adjustable angle</a>, saving weight over a typical out-front mount <em>and</em> better protecting your computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to write a lot of words about a stem. They’re mostly drama free, and most stems are more than strong enough these days. So it’s nice to see a bit of innovation here. Plus, it comes in colors to match all the other Race Face components. All in, the Turbine SL Stem is a win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><span><a href=\"https://www.raceface.com/products/turbine-sl-stem\">RaceFace.com</a></span></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/race-face-turbine-sl-stem-review/\">Race Face Turbine SL Stem Flip Flops Between Race &amp; Trail</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"7ef5b674f032b58a176c5df4880bda20d5cb6f2221eac39f54e5ec48db4ae714","category":"Cycling"}
