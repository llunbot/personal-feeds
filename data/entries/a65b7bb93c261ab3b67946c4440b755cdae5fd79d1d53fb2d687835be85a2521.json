It uses a die-cast rear subframe that packages the drive unit. For two-seaters, the battery pack goes behind the passenger compartment.

Partly that's because I first became a car nerd after discovering the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Seven\">Lotus Seven</a>. But it's also because light weight has always been a core Lotus attribute, and while electric vehicles have much to recommend them, \"light\" they typically are not.</p>\n<p>This would be immaterial until relatively recently, because the small British sports car company didn't have the resources to consider a switch to electric. But in 2017, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/05/lotus-cars-is-saved-being-bought-by-chinas-geely/\">Lotus was bought by Geely</a>, also the owner of a freshly revitalized Volvo. As is the Geely way, Lotus got some much-needed investment and has been set to work on electrification.</p>\n<p>In April of this year, Lotus revealed that its plans now include <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/a-freshly-flush-lotus-cars-readies-four-new-vehicle-architectures/\">four new platforms</a>, three of which are entirely electric. This week, we got a glimpse into the way the company is thinking about EVs, as it released some details about its lightweight electric vehicle architecture (or \"Project LEVA\" in Lotus-speak). The key is a newly developed rear subframe that's far lighter than the one in the V6-powered Emira (unveiled in July as <a href=\"https://petrolicious.com/articles/the-2022-lotus-emira-will-be-the-last-lotus-powered-by-an-internal-combustion-engine\">the last internal combustion engine-powered Lotus</a>).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797686#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797686&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
