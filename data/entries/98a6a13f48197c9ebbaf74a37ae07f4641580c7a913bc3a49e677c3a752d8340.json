Calling it their most capable and affordable eMTB yet, the Kado is a full-powered, 150mm travel bike built for trail or enduro riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Kado eMTB lineup includes options for full carbon, carbon/aluminum, or aluminum framed models. The bikes all come equipped with 29” wheels but can be converted to MX setups. Whyte went with Bosch drive systems, employing their newest Performance Line CX motors for all Kado models.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Whyte Kado – Frame Features and Specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road.webp\" alt=\"Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, side, dirt road\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the model, the Kado features either a full carbon, carbon/aluminum, or aluminum frame. The bikes provide 150mms of rear travel, and all models come with 160mm forks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whyte equips their bikes with custom-tuned rear shocks, but they didn’t provide details on how exactly the shock is tuned. They do note the Kados are compatible with coil or air shocks. The Kados’ linkages rotate on phosphate-coated bearings packed with marine grease to ensure long-lasting performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position.webp\" alt=\"Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, motor position\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A big priority in Whyte’s eMTB frame design is achieving the lowest possible center of gravity. The new Kados’ center of gravity is 12.5mm lower than Whyte’s previous mid-travel E-160 eMTB.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“By tilting up the motor, we’ve been able to slide the battery towards the bottom bracket and down towards the ground. This lowers the bike’s centre of gravity as much as possible, reduces the effect of the weight, and makes the bike more agile and a lot more fun to ride,” </em>says Sam Shucksmith, Head of Mountain Bike Design for Whyte Bikes. Shucksmith also happens to be the National and Series Champion of the 2024 British E-Enduro racing series. Both titles were won on prototype Kados.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel.webp\" alt=\"Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, rear wheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All Kado models come with 29” wheels, but they are MX-compatible. Riders can replace the stock “Shape.It” links with Whyte’s MX version to fit a 27.5” rear wheel. Swapping the link/wheel has no effect on geometry or suspension kinematics.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-KS-dropper-post.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-KS-dropper-post.webp\" alt=\"Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, dropper post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-KS-dropper-post.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-KS-dropper-post-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-KS-dropper-post-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-KS-dropper-post-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-KS-dropper-post-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-KS-dropper-post-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kados come with Trans-X Rad dropper posts on RS and S models, and KS Vantage posts on the RSX model. Small frames get 150mm posts, mediums run 170mm, and L/XLs get 200mm posts. The aluminum framed S model accepts a 30.9mm post, but the carbon front ends on the RS and RSX models run 34.9mm diameters.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-UDH.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-UDH.webp\" alt=\"Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, UDH derailleur\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-UDH.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-UDH-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-UDH-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-UDH-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-UDH-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-UDH-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All Kado frames are UDH/T-Type compatible, and rear axles are Boost 148mm.

The S model comes with a 600Wh battery, but a different version with an 800Wh battery is available in certain regions (which were not specified).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whyte did not provide any estimate of the Kados’ range or charge time for the batteries.<strong> </strong>All models come with a 4A charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-PowerMore.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-PowerMore.webp\" alt=\"Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, with PowerMore battery\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-PowerMore.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-PowerMore-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-PowerMore-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-PowerMore-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-PowerMore-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-PowerMore-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Except for small frames, the Kados can accommodate the Bosch PowerMore range extender, adding an extra 250Wh of capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whyte made sure the battery is easy to slide out of the frame so storage, swapping, or out-of-bike charging is a cinch. Whyte also noted they were able to maintain a strong down tube design by not cutting a large hole in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-controller-display.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-controller-display.webp\" alt=\"Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, top tube and display unit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-controller-display.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-controller-display-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-controller-display-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-controller-display-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-controller-display-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-controller-display-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bosch’s Mini Remote provides compact controls on the handlebar. The Bosch System Controller in the top tube houses the power button, plus indicates the assist level and battery life. Whyte gives the Kado RSX models a Purion 400 display unit too, so you can easily see your speed or other metrics as you ride.  The drive system offers four assist levels to choose from, including Bosch’s power-regulating eMTB mode. Bosch’s eBike Flow App can be used to customize settings, update software, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender.webp\" alt=\"Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, fender\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With all those electronic components, it’s reassuring to know Whyte has extensively tested the Kados year-round in wet, muddy U.K. conditions. The Kados include several weatherproofing touches (eg. sealed cable and hose ports) to keep your electronics safe and dry. The battery charge port was also located out of the path of rear wheel spray, and an integrated rear fender helps keep your bike cleaner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-geometry-chart.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"740\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-geometry-chart.webp\" alt=\"Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, geometry chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-geometry-chart.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-geometry-chart-297x183.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-geometry-chart-120x74.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-geometry-chart-768x474.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All Kado models are available in S, M, L, and XL frame sizes. The Kado frames include a flip-chip that offers High and Low geometry settings. The Low position slacks out the bike by 0.6° and drops the BB by 8mms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a quick look at key geo numbers, the Kado’s head tube angles are 64.4° in Low position or 65° in High. Seat mast angles range from 77.5° – 77.9° depending on frame size. Reach on a medium frame is 460mm, while a large measures 485mm. Chainstay length on all frame sizes is 450mm, and BB height is 350mm (High) or 342mm (Low).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Model Lineup:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest.webp\" alt=\"Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, angle, forest\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As noted above, the top-level RSX models have carbon frames, the mid-spec RS models are carbon front/aluminum rear, and the lower-end S models feature aluminum frames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AXS-equipped RSX models include one very nice touch – The derailleurs are wired in to get their power from the bike’s main battery. But what if you drain the battery, you ask? Whyte has cleverly wired the derailleur to the battery’s reserve lighting cells, so even if you run out of assist power there’s a little juice left to keep your derailleur working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weights for all models were not provided, but Whyte says a size medium Kado RSX weighs 24.2 kg/53.35 lbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Kado RSX: €8499</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-blue-side.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-blue-side.webp\" alt=\"Whyte Bikes Kado RSX eMTB, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-blue-side.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-blue-side-297x175.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-blue-side-120x71.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-blue-side-768x454.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For full build specs on each Kado model visit Whyte Bikes’ website.
