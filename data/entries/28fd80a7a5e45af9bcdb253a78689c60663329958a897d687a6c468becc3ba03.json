Back then, riders would have used a penny-farthing-type bicycle, and many different styles of bike have been allowed over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/09/02114927/alex_dowsett_hour_record-970x651.jpg\" alt=\"alex_dowsett_hour_record\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, since 2014 the UCI has stipulated that riders attempt the Hour on a standard track pursuit bicycle so that attempts could be roughly comparable with each other, a move that has helped spark a new wave of interest in the Hour record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That Tour de France winner and multiple Olympic champion <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/bradley-wiggins-sets-new-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">Bradley Wiggins</a> also chose the event to round off his career didn’t hurt its profile either.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the current cycling Hour record and who holds it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Men’s Hour record</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/03110542/ganna_hour_record_kit-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"ganna_hour_record_kit\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><em>Credit: Chris Auld Photo: Ineos Grenadiers</em></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Italian Ineos Grenadiers pro <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/filippo-ganna-hour-record\">Filippo Ganna</a> holds the current Hour record with a distance of 56.792km, set on 8th October 2022 at the Tissot Velodrome in Grenchen, Switzerland.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Hour record attempts being held in a velodrome, more often than not it’s an exceptional road time-triallist in the saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, attempting the Hour record requires a significant investment in both equipment and training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means riders will need their team’s permission to tailor their season towards attempting it, which can be tricky for the most in-demand riders and explains why there are relatively few attempts by big-name pro cyclists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Filippo Ganna managed a lowly seventh in the 2022 World Time Trial Championships in September in the run-up to his Hour record attempt, a minute slower than the winning ride. His Hour record time of 56.792km, however, set three weeks later, added 1.244km to the previous record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, many road riders and time-trial specialists have held the men’s Hour record, including such luminary names as Merckx, Moser, Obree, Indurain and Boardman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the UCI’s rule changes in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/jens-voigt-interview-ready-for-retirement\" target=\"_blank\">Jens Voigt</a> was the first rider to improve upon the record with a distance of 51.110km.

Bussi had previously held the women’s hour record in 2018 when she rode just over 48km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last women’s Hour record under the old regime was set on 1st October 2003 by Leontien van Moorsel, who managed a distance of 46.065km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>British Paralympian <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/qa-dame-sarah-storey\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Storey</a> made the first attempt at the unified record (see below). Endeavouring to improve the record on 28th February 2015 at Lee Valley Velo Park in London, she fell just short with a distance of 45.502km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year later, American Molly Shaffer Van Houweling succeeded, riding a distance of 46.273km at the high-altitude Aguascalientes velodrome in Mexico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following year, this effort was pushed further to 46.882km by Australian Bridie O’Donnell, although her claim stood for only just over a month before Evelyn Stevens won the title back for the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having previously failed on her first attempt in 2017, in 2018 Italian <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vittoria-bussi-sets-new-benchmark-for-uci-womens-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">Vittoria Bussi</a> made an incredible recovery a day after abandoning her initial ride after 40 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her distance of 48.007km stood for three years until <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/joss-lowden-breaks-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">Joss Lowden covered 48.405km </a>in September 2021. Lowden’s record in turn was eclipsed by van Dijk.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the cycling Hour record rules?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/11/getty-chris-boardman-hour-record-1-970x647.jpg\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Jerome Prevost via Getty</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hour record is the record for the longest distance covered in one hour on a bicycle. Riders attempt the record alone on a velodrome track and from a standing start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fundamental concept of the Hour hasn’t changed much since the first recorded attempts. However, the rules have changed over the years, particularly with regard to the style of bikes that can be used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the 90s, interest in the hour record peaked, as did <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/thinking-outside-the-box-what-if-there-were-no-uci-rules\" target=\"_blank\">innovation in bicycle design and rider positioning</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was driven partly by the rivalry between <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/graeme-obree-do-it-because-you-love-it\" target=\"_blank\">Graeme Obree</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/chris-boardman-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Boardman</a>, and their use of radically stretched or compressed positions and monocoque bikes caused debate over the ability to compare their rides to those of previous athletes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a series of piecemeal bans and rulings regarding the type of equipment allowed, in 1997 the UCI created two categories: the ‘UCI Hour Record’ and the ‘Best Human Effort’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former discipline restricted competitors to traditional-looking bicycles with wire spokes and outlawed time-trial helmets, aerodynamic bars, and monocoque frames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second allowed modern equipment. The idea was to create one record that could be compared across all time, and another allowing for advances in technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the UCI Hour record reverting in 2000 to the distance established by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/from-the-archive-in-conversation-with-eddy-merckx\" target=\"_blank\">Eddy Merckx</a> in 1972, Chris Boardman attempted the UCI record on a traditional bike and improved upon Merckx’s distance by just 10 metres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the presence of two separate records seemed to suck some of the prestige from both, and in 2014 the UCI unified them into a single classification, stipulating riders could use any equipment in line with regulations for track pursuit bikes at the time of their attempt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This reignited interest in the event, and ‘the Hour record’ as we understand it today refers to this unified classification. Beyond using the correct type of bike, the rider must also be within the UCI’s biological passport testing program to be eligible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What bikes are used for the Hour record?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/03110535/ganna_hour_record_bike-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"ganna_hour_record_bike\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Credit: Chris Auld Photo: Ineos Grenadiers</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bike used for the Hour record must meet the regulations for track pursuit events as dictated by the UCI. At their most basic, these regulations stipulate a track bicycle without brakes and using a fixed wheel drivetrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with most riders opting for a high-cadence approach, gearing is still often enormous, with Bradley Wiggins having opted to use a ratio of 58×14 for his attempt and Ganna riding a 65×14. Even so, Ganna’s cadence was close to 100rpm.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02225236/joss_howden_tom_griffiths_1-647x970.jpeg\" alt=\"joss_howden_tom_griffiths_1\" /><figcaption>Tom Griffiths</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/joss-lowden-hour-record-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Joss Lowden’s Hour Record Bike</a> </strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The rider will use a base bar at the front of the bike when setting off from the standing start. Above this will be a set of aero bars where the rider will spend the rest of their attempt tucked into an aerodynamic position.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/05001652/victor_campenaerts_ridley_arena_tt_16_2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"victor_campenaerts_ridley_arena_tt_16_2\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/check-out-victor-campenaertss-hour-record-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Victor Campenaerts’ Hour Record Bike</a> </strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the bike’s shape and the rider’s position will be tailored to balance the need to produce power and cut cleanly through the air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With riders travelling in the straightest line possible, most bikes will use twin disc wheels. While the bikes used are often extraordinarily expensive and highly customised, both frames and components used in an attempt must also be available for sale to the public. However, there are often disputes as to how closely this rule is adhered to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ganna’s bike was 3D printed from aluminium-magnesium-scandium alloy and cost a purported €75,000. The composite alloy used was heavier than carbon but probably also stiffer since with no hills in the velodrome, extra weight only matters in the initial acceleration from the standing start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders will also wear aerodynamic helmets, custom-made skinsuits and overshoes to further minimise air resistance and everything will have been fine-tuned in a wind-tunnel prior to the ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For all our Hour Record coverage, head to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">our hub page</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-hour-record\">What is the cycling Hour record?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"jdelves","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"28fd80a7a5e45af9bcdb253a78689c60663329958a897d687a6c468becc3ba03","category":"Cycling"}
