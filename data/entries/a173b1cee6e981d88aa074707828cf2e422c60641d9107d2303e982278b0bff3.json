Former president Greg Brockman, who quit in \nprotest of Altman’s firing, will return as well. </p>\n\n<p>The company said in a statement late Tuesday that it has an \n“agreement in principle” for Altman to return alongside a new \nboard composed of Bret Taylor, Larry Summers, and Adam D’Angelo. \nD’Angelo is a holdover from the previous board that initially \nfired Altman on Friday. He remains on this new board to give the \nprevious board some representation, we’re told. </p>\n\n<p>People familiar with the negotiations say that the main job of \nthis small initial board is to vet and appoint an expanded board \nof up to nine people that will reset the governance of OpenAI. \nMicrosoft, which has committed to investing billions in the \ncompany, wants to have a seat on that expanded board, as does \nAltman himself. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The question I’ve focused on from the start of this soap opera is who really controls OpenAI? The board thought it was them. It wasn’t.
