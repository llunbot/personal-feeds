The train never really stops rolling though, as we're also looking ahead to a new iPhone SE and other updates in early 2025, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>15 New Things Your iPhone Can Do in iOS 18.1</h2>\r<br />\niOS 18.1 is still in beta, but it's coming to all users later this month and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/27/new-things-your-iphone-will-do-ios-18-1/\">will bring a number of new features and improvements</a> including the first Apple Intelligence capabilities for owners of the latest iPhone models.

ANC means the ‌AirPods 4‌ have a feature set that rivals the AirPods Pro 2, so <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/28/airpods-4-vs-airpods-pro-2/\">we thought we'd compare the two</a> for those undecided on which to get.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/AirPods-4-vs-Pro-2-Thumb-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nYou're not going to get the same level of ANC with the ‌AirPods 4‌ that you get with the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 because there's no sealing mechanism to block out noise, but the ‌AirPods 4‌ still perform impressively well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone SE With Apple Intelligence, New iPad Air, and More Reportedly Launching 'Early Next Year'</h2>\r<br />\nLooking beyond the new Macs coming later this year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/new-iphone-se-and-ipad-air-early-2025-rumor/\">early 2025 is expected to see the debut of several other new Apple products</a> including a fourth-generation iPhone SE, updated iPad Air models, and more, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/iphone-se-4-spring-2025-what-to-expect/\">next iPhone SE is expected to be a notable upgrade</a>, moving from the legacy iPhone 8-style design with Touch ID Home button and large display bezels to an iPhone 14-like design with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-sourcing-iphone-se-oled-displays-report/\">OLED display</a> and Face ID.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple May Launch First iPad-Like Smart Home Accessory Next Year</h2>\r<br />\nFollowing a report last week from <em>9to5Mac</em> indicating that Apple's rumored iPad-like smart display for the home <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-smart-home-accessory-square-display/\">could feature a \"squarish\" display</a> with a launch targeted for next spring, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has confirmed that this is a simpler device than the one equipped with a robotic arm which has also been rumored.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/iPad-iOS-16-WP-Display-Feature-eric-edit.jpeg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThis simpler device arriving as soon as next spring <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/30/apple-launch-smart-home-display-next-year/\">would run a new \"homeOS\" platform</a> capable of running Apple apps like Calendar, Notes, and Home, and be \"optimized for controlling home appliances and quickly seeing information.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/oct-3-2024\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/05/top-stories-ios-18-1-coming-soon/\">Top Stories: iOS 18.1 Coming Soon, October Apple Event Rumors, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-ios-18-1-coming-soon-october-apple-event-rumors-and-more.2439234/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c4bfb370d7b493d450f0d5955b8fe6d54d769045ee07793331a253ee5c06de76","category":"Apple"}
