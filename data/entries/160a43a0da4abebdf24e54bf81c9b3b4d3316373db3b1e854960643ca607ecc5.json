In a reply to a question on X, Altman said GPT-5 would be coming in \"<a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1889757267425370415\">months</a>,\" suggesting a release later in 2025.</p>\n<p>Initially, Altman <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1889755723078443244\">explained</a> in a long post on X, the company plans to ship GPT-4.5 (previously known as \"Orion\" internally) in a matter of \"<a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1889757267425370415\">weeks</a>\" as OpenAI's last non-simulated reasoning model.
