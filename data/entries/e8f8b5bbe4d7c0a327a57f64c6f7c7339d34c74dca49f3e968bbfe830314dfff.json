Whether you do or don’t isn’t the point, though, it’s really about why you haven’t seen them already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot of stuff that happens behind the scenes of product development, and in this episode we talk about how things work, why bikes aren’t as advanced as they could be, and why the patent process really needs an overhaul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one might rattle a few cages, but I think you’ll really enjoy this inside look at the bike industry. <em>Enjoy!</em></p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Want More?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Find every episode of the BikeRumor Podcast on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bikerumor-podcast/id1455519558\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/bikerumor-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.podbean.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Podbean</a>, and through <a href=\"https://feed.podbean.com/bikerumor/feed.xml\" target=\"_blank\">RSS</a>, or wherever you listen to podcasts! Hit like, hit subscribe, and hit play!
