Thankfully, you can still get one on sale right now.: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Fitness/dp/B0CHX8SZQS?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 41mm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Fitness/dp/B0CHX427QK/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">45mm Apple Watch Series 9</a> for $329 and $359, a savings of $70 each and matching the lowest price we’ve seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 9 has the same 41mm and 45mm displays as the Series 8 with an identical array of sensors: ECG, blood-oxygen, heart rate, and temperature. However, it has a new S9 chip that’s faster and smarter with a new four-core Neural Engine, as well as all-day battery life, 50 meters of water resistance, Emergency SOS and Crash Detection, and the new double-tap gesture that lets you control apps without touching the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple announced it will stop shipping Apple Watches to Amazon and other retailers on December 25, so by January they might be hard to find. So grab one at this all-time-low price while you still can.</p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4ae6c3fac83215dffb012e3e7d9295684e407057da59b88b05bd1d42eb570f4c","category":"Apple"}
