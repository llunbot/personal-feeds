Jessica Rosenworcel, who has been acting FCC chairwoman since January, was today designated the permanent chair. Biden will also fill the empty Democratic slot on the commission by nominating Gigi Sohn, a longtime consumer advocate who was an FCC official during the Obama years. Then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/11/new-fcc-chair-was-industry-lobbyist-but-might-not-be-industry-shill/\">chose Sohn</a>Â in 2013 to serve as his counselor, a role in which she advocated for strong net neutrality rules and Title II common-carrier regulation of Internet service providers.</p>\n<p>Biden was able to promote Rosenworcel from acting to permanent chair immediately because the president can choose any sitting commissioner as chair. But Rosenworcel's current five-year term already expired, and she would have to leave the FCC entirely in January if she doesn't get a new term. That means Biden has to submit nominations to the Senate for both Rosenworcel and Sohn, and the Senate has to confirm them to avoid giving Republicans a 2-1 majority at the beginning of 2022.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807563#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807563&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f424e1416bb3685df6eb5488573e4fc0cd9d7c6eb49c096ec8154555bb622b67","category":"Tech"}
