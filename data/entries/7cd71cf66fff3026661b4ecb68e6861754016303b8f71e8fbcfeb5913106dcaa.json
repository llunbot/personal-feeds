It was groundbreaking; it was the first echo of the \"anything, anywhere\" Internet to come. And when The Serial Port went looking, it very much did not exist.</p>\n<div><div></div><p>The Serial Port's journey from wondering where the last Archie server was to hosting its own. </p></div>\n<p>While Archie would eventually be supplanted by Gopher, web portals, and search engines, it remains a useful way to index FTP sites and certainly should be preserved. The Serial Port did this, and the road to get there is remarkable and intriguing.

But I present here some notable bits of the tale, perhaps to tempt you into digging further.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024876#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024876&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7cd71cf66fff3026661b4ecb68e6861754016303b8f71e8fbcfeb5913106dcaa","category":"Tech"}
