But it’s <em>your</em> iPhone, why not use a custom ringtone that only you have? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can even set certain ringtones for specific contacts, so you immediately know who it is when they call. For example, you can set a song that’s special to you and your spouse as a ringtone, so when your spouse calls, you’ll hear the song and know immediately who it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can even make a custom ringtone right on your iPhone with GarageBand, or use your Mac and edit it in the Music app, as long as you know the steps.

Play the song and keep an eye on the elapsed time at the top of the app. Note the time stamp where you want the ringtone to start, then note where you want it to end. (Note: Ringtones cannot be longer than 30 seconds.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Right-click on the song and in the pop-up menu, select <em>Get Info</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A window with the details of the song file will appear. Click <em>Options</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In Options, there are timecodes for Start and Stop. Check the <em>Start</em> checkbox and enter the starting time from step 2. Then check the <em>Stop</em> box and enter the end time. Click <em>OK</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select the file, and then click on the File menu and select <em>Convert</em> &gt; <em>Create AAC version</em>. (If the only option you see is <em>Create MP3 version</em>, select that.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A new copy of your song file will appear under the original. Right-click on it and select <em>Show in Finder</em>. (If you can’t see the copy of the song below the one you just converted click on Songs on the left, and search for that track).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A Finder window with the song file should appear on your desktop. Look at the file’s extension (the extension appears after the file name and a period “.”). If you don’t see the extension, right-click on the file, select <em>Get Info</em>, and then look for the Name &amp; Extension section. Then do one of the following:\n<ul>\n<li>If the extension is <em>.m4a</em> click on the name and change the extension to <em>.m4r</em>. Confirm you want to change the extension.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If the extension is <em>.mp3</em>, the file needs to be converted to .m4a. Open the file in QuickTime Player, which is in your Applications folder. Then in QuickTime Player, click on the <em>File</em> menu and select <em>Export As</em> &gt; <em>Audio Only</em>. Name the file, choose a place to save it, then click <em>Save</em>. Then change the extension of the newly exported file to <em>.m4r</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you have a suitable ringtone file, and you just need to install it on your iPhone, read on for how to do that.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/show-in-finder.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Music show in finder\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/show-in-finder.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/show-in-finder.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/show-in-finder.jpg?resize=768%2C469&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/show-in-finder.jpg?resize=1200%2C733&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"733\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to get the ringtone you created on to your iPhone</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you used a Mac, as per the steps above, to create your ringtone, here’s how to get that on your iPhone:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Connect your iPhone to your Mac via USB.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open a Finder window (press ⌘-N on the desktop).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the sidebar under Locations, you should find your iPhone.

You can use other audio editing software to produce one. Fortunately, Apple gives you GarageBand for free, and it’s available on both Mac and iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to use the iPhone version of GarageBand to make a ringtone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can start from scratch (we’re not going to show you how to make a song in this tutorial) or you can edit an existing sound file, which we’ll demonstrate here. The ringtone must be no longer than 30 seconds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you edit in GarageBand, here’s how to prep for the file you want to edit.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you have an existing sound file, copy it to iCloud Drive.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you want to edit a song, you must have the song file, either by buying it online or ripping it from a CD. If you have the actual song file already on your iPhone, you will be able to access it through GarageBand.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Copy-protected song files cannot be edited.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Streamed Apple Music songs or songs from another streaming service cannot be used as ringtones.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to edit a sound file in GarageBand for iPhone and then save it as a ringtone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t have or want to use your Mac, you can create a custom ringtone right on your phone with a little work. You can import a pre-recorded song—again, it needs to be an unprotected track that you own—or create something original using GarageBand’s instruments. Here’s how to get it done:</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/garageband-ios-buttons.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Garage Band iOS Tracks Loops buttons\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/garageband-ios-buttons.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/garageband-ios-buttons.jpg?resize=300%2C91&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/garageband-ios-buttons.jpg?resize=768%2C233&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/garageband-ios-buttons.jpg?resize=1200%2C365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"365\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Left: the Tracks button.<br />Right: the Loop Browser button.</figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Launch GarageBand.
