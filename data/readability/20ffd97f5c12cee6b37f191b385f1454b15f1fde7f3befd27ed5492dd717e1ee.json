The main events are a beer release, a fireside hangout with Dogfish Head’s founder, and an easy trail ride. Of course, visitors also get swag packages at the <a href=\"https://www.dogfish.com/inn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">uber-hip Inn</a>.</p><div id=\"attachment_270455\"><p><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-270455\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03152802/Dogfish-INN_Cottage-Lobby1.jpg\" alt=\"Dogfish Inn lobby\" width=\"1200\" height=\"799\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03152802/Dogfish-INN_Cottage-Lobby1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03152802/Dogfish-INN_Cottage-Lobby1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03152802/Dogfish-INN_Cottage-Lobby1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03152802/Dogfish-INN_Cottage-Lobby1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03152802/Dogfish-INN_Cottage-Lobby1-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03152802/Dogfish-INN_Cottage-Lobby1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03152802/Dogfish-INN_Cottage-Lobby1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03152802/Dogfish-INN_Cottage-Lobby1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03152802/Dogfish-INN_Cottage-Lobby1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03152802/Dogfish-INN_Cottage-Lobby1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03152802/Dogfish-INN_Cottage-Lobby1-768x511.jpg 768w\"></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-270455\">The lobby at the Dogfish Inn.</p></div><p>Priority helps ‘curate’ the event.

According to Dogfish Head, the point is to “talk about everything beer, biking and beyond.” After what figures to be a night of heavily intoxicated sleep, the trail ride on Saturday takes the “moderate” 5.8-mile Junction &amp; Breakwater Trail. From what we can tell, <a href=\"https://delawaregreenways.org/trail/junction-breakwater-trail/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it promises to be a pretty casual ride</a>. In fact, its actual purpose looks like the scheduled stops: sessions at Revolution and Dogfish Head breweries are on the docket.</p><p>The end of the ride will signify the end of the curated, co-branded partying. Dogfish Head, of course, suggests that guests eat at its various local offshoot restaurants ahead of what figures to be a heavy night’s sleep at the Inn.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03154705/Dogfish-INN_Double-Queen-Room1.jpg\" alt=\"A Dogfish Inn bedroom\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03154705/Dogfish-INN_Double-Queen-Room1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03154705/Dogfish-INN_Double-Queen-Room1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03154705/Dogfish-INN_Double-Queen-Room1-800x534.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03154705/Dogfish-INN_Double-Queen-Room1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03154705/Dogfish-INN_Double-Queen-Room1-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03154705/Dogfish-INN_Double-Queen-Room1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03154705/Dogfish-INN_Double-Queen-Room1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03154705/Dogfish-INN_Double-Queen-Room1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03154705/Dogfish-INN_Double-Queen-Room1-800x534.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03154705/Dogfish-INN_Double-Queen-Room1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/03154705/Dogfish-INN_Double-Queen-Room1-768x513.jpg 768w\"></p><h2>Dogfish Head Priority Bicycles weekend pricing</h2><p>Of course, the exclusive chaperoned rollicking comes at a price. The least you’ll throw down for the weekend is $673.24 for a single king room at the Inn. Note well; pricing is not inclusive — the listed prices include the stay and the swag, and that’s it. Yes, your alcohol bill is your own responsibility. That seems fair, but we’d suggest deep pockets or a strictly moderated approach; how much did you drink the last time you only got on your bike once all weekend?</p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Sam Anderson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"20ffd97f5c12cee6b37f191b385f1454b15f1fde7f3befd27ed5492dd717e1ee","category":"Cycling"}
