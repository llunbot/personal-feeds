That's right—it's time for the 2023 edition of our annual Charity Drive!</p>\n<p>Every year <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/11/the-opposable-thumbs-childs-play-giveaway-you-donate-we-give-you-stuff/\">since 2007</a>, we've encouraged readers to give to <a href=\"https://childsplaycharity.org/\">Penny Arcade's Child's Play charity</a>, which provides toys and games to kids being treated in hospitals around the world. In recent years, we've added the <a href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/donate/\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> to our charity push, aiding in their efforts to defend Internet freedom. This year, as always, we're providing some extra incentive for those donations by offering donors a chance to win pieces of our big pile of vendor-provided swag. We can't keep it, and we don't want it clogging up our offices, so it's now yours to win.</p>\n<p>This year's swag pile is full of high-value geek goodies. <strong>We have 40 prizes valued at over $2,500 total</strong>, including gaming hardware and accessories, collectibles, books, apparel, and more. In 2022, Ars readers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/ars-readers-gave-over-31500-in-our-2022-charity-drive/\">raised over $31,500 for charity</a>, contributing to a total haul of <strong>more than $465,000 since 2007.</strong> We want to raise even more this year, and we can do it if readers dig deep.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984381#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984381&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"00fc42023ccde87e7d1f6ec9e0314558081d751cdc474182f074f8d1e7af038e","category":"Tech"}
