Fun fact: the last climb is the road they came down after climbing the very steep Cat 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for: </strong>Maybe the GC riders? 2021 has seen so many breakaways stay clear in Grand Tours that it’s hard to say for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dane Cash’s picks: </strong><em>If this comes down to the pack, it’s hard to look past Primož Roglič, but Movistar might try to leverage the one-two punch of Enric Mas and Miguel Ángel López here. They have to try some time … Should a break go the distance, Michael Storer has proven himself worthy of contender status. Storer’s DSM teammate Romain Bardet and most of the riders on the Bahrain Victorious roster – particularly Damiano Caruso – are also on the long list of riders to watch.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-vuelta-profile-stage14.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stage14.jpeg\" /></figure>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/preview-what-you-need-to-know-about-stage-14-of-the-vuelta-a-espana/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"59f397edbdc93f92941ffc235473d07425504c122784445cd550bec91a4378e6","category":"Cycling"}
