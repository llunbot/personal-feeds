After a six year break, the Vittoria Tweed Valley EWS is returning to Scotland’s network of epic trails around Innerleithen. That also means that Jessie-May didn’t have to look far to find some prototypes lurking around the pits.</p><div id=\"attachment_273416\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155520/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-6.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-273416\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155520/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-6.jpg\" alt=\"Hope Bikes High Pivot Prototype Enduro Bike\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155520/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-6.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155520/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-6-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155520/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-6-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155520/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-6-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155520/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-6-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-273416\">All photos c.

After introducing their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2019/08/02/hope-hb130-aspires-to-be-the-perfect-do-it-all-trail-bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new Hb.130</a> in 2019, their longer travel HB.160 was dropped from the lineup. Could we be looking at the HB.160’s replacement? Based on the number of high pivot enduro bikes we’ve seen lately, it seems likely. While the current HB.130 uses a Horst Link style rear suspension linkage, this one looks to use a concentric pivot around the axle similar to the dw-link Split Pivot or Trek ABP.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155525/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155525/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-7.jpg\" alt=\"Hope Bikes High Pivot Prototype Enduro Bike idler pulley\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155525/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-7.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155525/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-7-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155525/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-7-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155525/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-7-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155525/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-7-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>From the looks of it, it seems to follow the HB formula of a meticulously crafted carbon front end paired with a CNC machined aluminum rear end that’s bonded together at key joints. Only, this time there is an idler pulley mounted to the raised chainstay with its own CNC machined chain guide (of course). It also looks like there’s a flip chip at the upper seat stay pivot—perhaps to modify geometry or allow for mullet 27.5/29″ and 29/29″ wheel set ups?</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155529/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-8.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155529/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-8.jpg\" alt=\"Hope Bikes High Pivot Prototype Enduro Bike suspension linkage\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155529/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-8.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155529/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-8-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155529/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-8-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155529/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-8-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155529/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-8-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155457/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155457/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-1.jpg\" alt=\"Hope Bikes High Pivot Prototype Enduro Bike downtube storage\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155457/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-1.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155457/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-1-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155457/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155457/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-1-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/01155457/Hope-bikes-high-pivot-prototype-spy-shot-Jessie-May-Bikerumor-2021-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>Ahead of the Ohlins coil shock, there is a plate that looks like it could be used for internal downtube storage.
