Don’t panic though – the really only includes models with a very specific stem, and the company is making it super easy to find out if your bike is impacted. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-affected-model-single-bolt.png\"><img width=\"512\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-affected-model-single-bolt.png\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-affected-model-single-bolt.png 512w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-affected-model-single-bolt-297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-affected-model-single-bolt-120x120.png 120w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>Only stems with one silver bolt are included in the recall. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The recall window includes all woom Original models sold from 2018-2021 in sizes 1, 1 PLUS, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. However, <em>only</em> woom models with a single bolt stem and a silver bolt like that above are affected. If the bolts are not tightened to 10Nm with a torque wrench, there is a risk of the handlebar and stem detaching from the bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-not-afected-single-bolt.png\"><img width=\"512\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-not-afected-single-bolt.png\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-not-afected-single-bolt.png 512w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-not-afected-single-bolt-297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-not-afected-single-bolt-120x120.png 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-not-affected-dual-bolt.png\"><img width=\"512\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-not-affected-dual-bolt.png\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-not-affected-dual-bolt.png 512w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-not-affected-dual-bolt-297x297.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Woom-kids-bike-stem-recall-not-affected-dual-bolt-120x120.png 120w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>Both of these stems are not included in the recall.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same time frame, bikes were sold with stems with a single black bolt, or two silver bolts. Neither of these stems are included in the recall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make it even easier to identify, woom has added a stem identification survey on their website. Simply <a href=\"https://woom.getfeedback.com/online-stem-checker/\" target=\"_blank\">click on the link</a>, and compare the pictures to the stem on your child’s bike. If it is one of the affected models, then woom will send you a stem maintenance kit. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s in the Stem Maintenance Kit? It’s simply a torque wrench, a packet of assembly paste (5 g), a 5 mm hex key, and instructions. So even if your stem is one of the affected models, it seems like simply cleaning the steerer, adding assembly paste, and properly torquing the bolt will ensure its safety without replacing any of the parts. Just another example of why you should always properly torque your bolts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://faq.us.woombikes.com/article/337-stem-recall-notice\" target=\"_blank\">woom.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/voluntary-recall-select-woom-original-kids-bikes-2018-2021/\">Woom Announces Voluntary Recall of Select Original Kid’s Bikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"eaea301ff558e1f99c6a871b06fc221cd57c0dfbb030e8c88148eec8a7198716","category":"Cycling"}
