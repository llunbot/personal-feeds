{"title":"Kuo: Apple Planning Smart Home Camera and New AirPods With More Health Features","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/kuo-apple-smart-home-camera-and-more-2026/","date":1731381017000,"content":"In a blog post today, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/goertek-secures-npi-supplier-for-two-new-apple-products-in-2026-apple-business-set-to-resume-80f31db1dd4e\">revealed</a> two new products that Apple apparently plans to release in a few years from now, including a smart home camera and updated AirPods with more health management features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/homekit-showdown-redux.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nKuo said mass production of Apple's smart home camera is scheduled to begin in 2026, and the company apparently aims to sell tens of millions of them over the long term. He said the camera will have wireless connectivity, and deep integration with Apple Intelligence and Siri, but he did not mention any other specific features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrevious rumors have indicated that Apple is planning to release a smart home display, but that device is expected to launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/30/apple-launch-smart-home-display-next-year/\">as early as 2025</a>, so it seems like the 2026 camera that Kuo has mentioned here is a different product.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the AirPods, Kuo simply said that future models of the earbuds will have \"more health management features\" like the Apple Watch, and that Chinese manufacturer Goertek will serve as the primary supplier of a 2026 AirPods model. The new smart home camera will also be assembled by Goertek, according to the analyst.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe previously reported that Apple's upcoming Powerbeats Pro 2 will offer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/06/what-to-expect-from-powerbeats-pro-2/\">heart rate monitoring during workouts</a>, and perhaps that feature will extend to AirPods in the future. In addition, health-focused sensors that could allow for features like body temperature measuring have been rumored for AirPods in the past.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/kuo-apple-smart-home-camera-and-more-2026/\">Kuo: Apple Planning Smart Home Camera and New AirPods With More Health Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-planning-smart-home-camera-and-new-airpods-with-more-health-features.2442698/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ce8e51a2e11e905717d85a21445d1c0b575838b6d6cfaf8eca421c2fbe60c999","category":"Apple"}
