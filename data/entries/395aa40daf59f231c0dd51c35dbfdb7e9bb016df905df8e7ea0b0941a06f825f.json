He said it was \"theoretically\" possible the finish could be released for the new model this year. Previously, the high-end Edition model of the Apple Watch Series 7 was available with a Space Black titanium case.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother new feature expected for the Ultra is a faster S9 chip, which Gurman said is based on the A15 Bionic chip first used in iPhone 13 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe second-generation Apple Watch Ultra is expected to be announced in September alongside the Apple Watch Series 9, which is rumored to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/apple-watch-series-9-pink-color/\">available in pink</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nReleased in September 2022, the Apple Watch Ultra is a larger and more rugged version of the Apple Watch designed for hiking, extreme water sports, diving, and other outdoor activities.
