Apple stuck with the same system as last year and went with:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 15</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 15 Plus</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We may see an iPhone 16 Ultra in 2024, read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16: Everything you need to know</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When did the iPhone 15 launch?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 15-series handsets were announced at Apple’s Wonderlust event on September 12. Pre-orders from <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-1351959-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s website</a> then started at 5 a.m. PDT, at 8 a.m. EDT, and 1 p.m. in the U.K on Friday, September 15. The phones eventually went on sale on September 22.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15-series price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are Apple’s prices of the new iPhones. In the U.S. you will pay more for an unlocked iPhone, you pay more if you don’t want the handset to be locked to a network. In the U.K. these prices are for unlocked iPhones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, these prices are better than the 2022 equivalents. In 2022 the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus cost more, and while the price of the Pro and Pro Max have stayed the same in the U.S., it has been reduced in the U.K., but gone up in Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also note that the 15 Pro Max now starts at 256GB of storage instead of 128GB, so it isn’t as expensive as it seems.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to buy a new iPhone 15? Don’t pay more than you need to!

We have various articles that attempt to answer the question, which we will link to below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For help choosing the best iPhone for you read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/228816/best-iphone-pro-mini-max.html\">iPhone comparison chart 2023: Every iPhone compared</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wondering if you should upgrade from your specific handset?

There have been reports about various issues, including the iPhone 15 getting too hot and being easily damaged. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Damage</strong>: In this YouTube video it appears that it is very easy to damage the glass on the back of the new iPhone. If this is true then we suggest that once you have your new iPhone don’t forget to get a case to protect it.

Apple also notes that: “For iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, the oil from your skin might temporarily alter the color of the outside band.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Overheating</strong>: There are reports that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2083659/iphone-15-pro-overheating-thermal-system-design-software-update.html\">iPhone 15 Pro has overheating issues</a> and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks this might be because of “compromises made in the thermal system design to achieve a lighter weight, such as the reduced heat dissipation area and the use of a titanium frame, which negatively impacts thermal efficiency.” Kuo says Apple is expected to address the overheating issues in a software update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is good news too though: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lower cost repairs; </strong>Apple has cut the cost of repairs for the new iPhones, so, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2072703/apple-slashes-cost-iphone-back-glass-repairs.html\">if you break your new iPhone 15 Pro, it’ll be a lot cheaper to fix</a> than the iPhone 14.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Easier repairs: </strong>And that repair may be easier according to iFixIt’s teardown.

The older iPhones have not been updated. Only the Pro models support faster data transfers at 10Gbps. iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are capped at 480Mbps like Lightning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a USB-C cable in the box, but you will need to buy a 20W adapter plug if you don’t already own one.

There is no plug in the box (hasn’t been since 2020) but you will find a USB-C cable, which if you have a 20w plug will allow for fast charging.

This should provide an improved strength to weight ratio compared to stainless steel, and sure enough, weights are down across both Pro models. (The 15 Pro Max, for example, weighs 221 grams, down from the 14 Pro Max’s 240 grams. That’s a drop of just under 8 percent. The 15 Pro is down 9 percent in weight.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here are the color options for the iPhone 15 Pro. They are listed on Apple’s website as Black Titanium, White Titanium, Blue Titanium, and Natural Titanium. Why don’t the Pro models ever get interesting colors?</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-color-options-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 15 Pro color options\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-color-options-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2360w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-color-options-2.jpg?resize=300%2C163&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-color-options-2.jpg?resize=768%2C418&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-color-options-2.jpg?resize=1200%2C652&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-color-options-2.jpg?resize=1536%2C835&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-color-options-2.jpg?resize=2048%2C1113&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"652\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As with 2022’s iPhone 14 line, the U.S. models all feature dual eSIM support and have no physical SIM slot. U.K. customers <em>do</em> get physical nano-SIM slots, but note that if you’ve got a SIM card in there you’ll only be able to use one eSIM.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15, Plus, Pro, Max new features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new phones can do a few things that their predecessors couldn’t. The inclusion of USB-C, for instance, makes it a little easier to use a single charger for multiple Apple devices. The Dynamic Island is now on all four models (last year it was just on the Pro handsets) and its functions have been expanded. Perhaps the most interesting upgrade, however, is reverse charging: you can now charge an Apple Watch or a set of 2nd-gen AirPods Pro by plugging them into your phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read about the cheaper models’ upgrades in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2064814/iphone-15-plus-new-features-a16-camera-charging-usbc-display.html\">The five best new iPhone 15 features</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from a bunch of design upgrades, and the super-fast new A17 Pro chip, the Pro models come with some very cool photography features.

All four iPhone 15 handsets use more recycled materials than previous generations. The standard models boast “100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery and 100 percent recycled copper in the main logic board, copper wire in the Taptic Engine, and copper foil in the inductive charger in MagSafe,” along with impressive claims related to aluminium, gold, and rare earth materials, whereas the Pro models feature “100 percent recycled aluminum substructure and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery–both firsts for Apple.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company further claims numerous achievements related to energy efficiency and the removal or reduction of plastic and harmful chemicals, and has pledged to “no longer use leather in any new Apple products.” You can read all about this on <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-1351959-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/environment/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s environment page</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-FineWoven.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 15 FineWoven accessories\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-FineWoven.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1960w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-FineWoven.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-FineWoven.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-FineWoven.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-FineWoven.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-FineWoven.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iPhone-15-FineWoven.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption>These FineWoven accessories are made from a microtwill with significantly lower emissions than leather.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15, Plus, Pro, Max tech specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the key tech specs of the new iPhones. Note particularly that the 15 and 15 Plus get last year’s processors (the A16 Bionic that appeared in the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max), whereas the Pro models get the brand-new A17 Pro chip. This is the first Apple chip made using a 3nm process–indeed Apple cites it as an industry first–which means far higher transistor density and greater power efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 15</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A16 Bionic processor (6-core CPU, 5-core GPU)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>6.1-inch 2556×1179 460ppi Super Retina XDR display</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dual-lens rear camera: 48MP f/1.6 Main, 12MP f/2.4 Ultra Wide; up to 2X optical zoom</li>\n\n\n\n<li>12MP f/1.9 front camera</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Smart HDR 5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>128/256/512GB storage</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Estimated battery life: Up to 20 hours video playback</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fast charge: Up to 50% charge in 30 minutes with 20W adapter</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wi‑Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, 5G</li>\n\n\n\n<li>USB-C charging/data connection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>IP68 dust and water resistance (maximum depth 6m up to 30 minutes)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5.81 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches (147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>6.02 ounces (171 grams)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 15 Plus</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A16 Bionic processor (6-core CPU, 5-core GPU)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>6.7-inch 2796×1290 460ppi Super Retina XDR display</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dual-lens rear camera: 48MP f/1.6 Main, 12MP f/2.4 Ultra Wide; up to 2X optical zoom</li>\n\n\n\n<li>12MP f/1.9 front camera</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Smart HDR 5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>128/256/512GB storage</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Estimated battery life: Up to 26 hours video playback</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fast charge: Up to 50% charge in 35 minutes with 20W adapter</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wi‑Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, 5G</li>\n\n\n\n<li>USB-C charging/data connection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>IP68 dust and water resistance (maximum depth 6m up to 30 minutes)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>6.33 x 3.06 x 0.31 inches (160.9 x 77.8 x 7.8mm)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>7.09 ounces (201 grams)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 15 Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A17 Pro processor (6-core CPU, 6-core GPU)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>6.1-inch 2556×1179 460ppi Super Retina XDR always-on display with ProMotion</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Triple-lens rear camera: 48MP f/1.78 Main, 12MP f/2.2 Ultra Wide, 12MP f/2.8 Telephoto; up to 3X optical zoom</li>\n\n\n\n<li>12MP f/1.9 front camera</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Smart HDR 5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>128/256/512GB/1TB storage</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Estimated battery life: Up to 23 hours video playback</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fast charge: Up to 50% charge in 30 minutes with 20W adapter</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wi‑Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, Thread, 5G</li>\n\n\n\n<li>USB-C charging/data connection (supports USB 3)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>IP68 dust and water resistance (maximum depth 6m up to 30 minutes)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5.77 x 2.78 x 0.32 inches (146.6 x 70.6 x 8.25mm)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>6.60 ounces (187 grams)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 15 Pro Max</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A17 Pro processor (6-core CPU, 6-core GPU)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>6.7-inch 2796×1290 460ppi Super Retina XDR always-on display with ProMotion</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Triple-lens rear camera: 48MP f/1.78 Main, 12MP f/2.2 Ultra Wide, 12MP f/2.8 Telephoto; up to 5X optical zoom</li>\n\n\n\n<li>12MP f/1.9 front camera</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Smart HDR 5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>256/512GB/1TB storage</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Estimated battery life: Up to 29 hours video playback</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fast charge: Up to 50% charge in 35 minutes with 20W adapter</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wi‑Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, Thread, 5G</li>\n\n\n\n<li>USB-C charging/data connection (supports USB 3)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>IP68 dust and water resistance (maximum depth 6m up to 30 minutes)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>6.29 x 3.02 x 0.32 inches (159.9 x 76.7 x 8.25mm)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>7.81 ounces (221 grams)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The switch from Lightning to USB-C as the charging and data-transfer port, across all four models, is highly significant.
