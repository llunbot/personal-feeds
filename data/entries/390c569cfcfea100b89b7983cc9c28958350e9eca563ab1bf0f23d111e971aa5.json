However, he does not expect the robots to launch for several more years, if ever.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Apple-Robot-Thumb-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nKuo today <a href=\"https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1889694419907125342\">said</a> Apple's robot projects remain in the proof-of-concept stage within the company. In the event that Apple decides to move forward with launching the robots, Kuo believes that mass production likely won't begin until 2028 or later. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo's prediction comes after a team of robotics researchers at Apple designed and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/apple-prototypes-tabletop-robot/\">prototyped a lamp-like robot</a> with lifelike movements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last year reported that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-tabletop-robotic-home-device-2026/\">developing a tabletop robot</a> with an \"iPad-like display\" attached to a \"robotic limb.\" Barring any setbacks, he said Apple was aiming to announce the device as early as 2026 or 2027. As mentioned above, though, Kuo's current prediction for the robots is 2028 or later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe tabletop robot would be primarily controlled with Siri and Apple Intelligence, according to Gurman. He said the device could respond to commands such as \"look at me,\" which would position the screen on the user's face during a FaceTime video call. The device would also understand different voices, he said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe tabletop robot could become a higher-end version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/26/homepod-hub-with-7-inch-screen-rumor/\">Apple's rumored smart home hub</a>, which is expected to launch this year. Apple is aiming for a price of around $1,000, according to Gurman, but the plans could change.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-robot/\">Apple Robot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/kuo-apple-robots-likely-2028-or-later/\">Here's When Apple's First Robots Are Expected to Enter Mass Production</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-when-apples-first-robots-are-expected-to-enter-mass-production.2449245/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"390c569cfcfea100b89b7983cc9c28958350e9eca563ab1bf0f23d111e971aa5","category":"Apple"}
