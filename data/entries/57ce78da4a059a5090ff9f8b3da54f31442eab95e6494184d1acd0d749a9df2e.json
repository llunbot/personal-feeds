Signing up to a monthly subscription from within the iOS YouTube app has also increased to $18.99, up from $15.99. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnnual plans have gone up from $119.99 to $139.99, introducing a $20 hike, while the student plan has also gone up from $6.99 per month to $7.99 per month. The only plan that is unchanged is the family plan, which is still $22.99 per month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYouTube is also raising the price of Music Premium from $9.99 to $10.99 per month. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle hasn't officially announced the price hikes yet, but the increases are already evident on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/premium\">YouTube's Premium plan sign-up webpage</a>.
