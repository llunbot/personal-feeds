He revealed this information in an investor research note earlier this month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iPhone-14-Pro-Dynamic-Island.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nEarlier this year, a leaker known as Digital Chat Station also claimed that the iPhone 17 Pro Max would adopt a metalens for Face ID that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/iphone-17-pro-max-smaller-dynamic-island/\">integrates the transmitter and receiver components</a>. They said that this change would reduce the size of some of the Face ID components, resulting in a smaller Dynamic Island on the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast year, Pu also said that the iPhone 17 Pro Max would have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/\">much narrower Dynamic Island</a>, as a result of the metalens. However, he now believes that all of the iPhone 17 models will adopt a metalens, meaning that the change would extend to the base model iPhone 17, the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, and the smaller iPhone 17 Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn January, however, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that he expects the Dynamic Island‌'s size to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/iphone-17-no-dynamic-island-change/\">remain \"largely unchanged\"</a> across the ‌iPhone 17‌ series.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll three sources have proven track records of sharing details about future Apple products, so it remains to be seen if the Dynamic Island will change in size.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn any case, next year's iPhone 18 Pro models are rumored to feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/\">under-screen Face ID with only a small front camera hole</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/face-id/\">Face ID</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/iphone-17-metalens-rumor/\">iPhone 17 With a Smaller Dynamic Island?
