{"title":"Deals: Verizon Has New Siri Remote for $49.97 ($9 Off), Apple Pencil 2 for $103.99, and More","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/deals-verizon-siri-remote-apple-pencil/","date":1628258554000,"content":"Last month we tracked a pair of discounts on a few Apple accessories offered by Verizon, including the Apple Pencil 2 and 2021 11-inch iPad Pro Magic Keyboard. Both of these sales are still happening on Verizon in August, in addition to a returning discount on the new Siri Remote.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/Siri-Remote-2-49.97-Feature.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Verizon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nStarting with the Siri Remote, Verizon has the new version of the Apple TV accessory for <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-siri-remote-apple-tv%2F\"><strong>$49.97</strong></a>, down from $59.00. This sale first appeared back in May, but it hadn't reemerged until now. If you've been looking to purchase the new Siri Remote as an add-on to an older Apple TV 4K model, this is likely the best price we'll track on this accessory in 2021.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-siri-remote-apple-tv%2F\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$9 OFF</div>New Siri Remote for $49.97</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are a lot of changes to the new Siri Remote, now featuring a one-piece aluminum body, tactile clickpad with five-way navigtation, and rearranged buttons. The clickpad also supports touch gestures, with the outer ring supporting a circular \"jog\" gesture that Apple says will help you find the exact spot you're looking for in a video.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Apple-Pencil-25-off.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMoving to the Apple Pencil 2, you can get this accessory for <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-ipad-pro%2F\"><strong>$103.99</strong></a>, down from $129.00. This sale doesn't require any coupon codes, and Verizon offers free two day shipping for most orders placed within the United States.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-ipad-pro%2F\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$25 OFF</div>Apple Pencil 2 for $103.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a second-best price for the Apple Pencil 2, and it's a match of the previous best price seen on the accessory earlier in 2021. Although the Apple Pencil 2 has dropped to around $99.00 in the past, this offer is extremely rare and Verizon's current sale is definitely a solid choice if you're on the hunt for the Apple Pencil 2.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/2021-Magic-Keyboard-Blue.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThirdly, the 2021 11-inch iPad Pro Magic Keyboard is priced at <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-magic-keyboard-case-for-11-inch-ipad-pro-2021-11-inch-ipad-pro-2020%2F\"><strong>$239.19</strong></a>, down from $299.00. This is the first cash discount on the White version of the 11-inch Magic Keyboard that we've tracked, but we have seen the Black model down to around $199 before.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-magic-keyboard-case-for-11-inch-ipad-pro-2021-11-inch-ipad-pro-2020%2F\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$60 OFF</div>11-Inch Magic Keyboard for $239.19</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe 11-inch Magic Keyboard first launched in Black in early 2020, and Apple followed up that release with a White finish earlier this spring. Both colors are on sale today on Verizon, and just like the Apple Pencil 2 deal, you won't need any coupon code to see these savings.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Magic Keyboard features a built-in trackpad and floating cantilever design for multiple viewing angle options.
