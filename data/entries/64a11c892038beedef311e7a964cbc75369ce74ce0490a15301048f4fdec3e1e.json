It borrows its off-road cousin’s flat handlebars and a more upright, traffic- and comfort-friendly position.</p>\n<p>Like a road bike, modern hybrids are usually built around <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/700c-wheels/\">700c wheels</a>. However, the tyres are often wider than a road bike’s – but usually not as wide as a mountain bike – enabling you to traverse rough roads and gravel paths comfortably, especially with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">best gravel bike tyres</a>.</p>\n<p>Most hybrids have a rigid fork, but some are also sold with cheaper suspension forks. While the idea of suspension may seem appealing, be wary, because most models have heavy low-end forks that add little to the comfort of the bike.</p>\n<p>Cheaper hybrids usually have rim brakes, while the best hybrid bikes are equipped with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">disc brakes</a>.</p>\n<p>Disc brakes offer more powerful, predictable and reliable braking – even in the rain – than rim brakes. They are definitely something you should look out for.</p>\n<p>Hybrid bikes are also hugely versatile, with many bikes ready to go with bosses and mounts for every accessory imaginable. This makes them ideal for conversion to other duties, such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-touring-bike-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you/\">touring</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth looking out for hybrids with accessories. Adding on mudguards, a rack and lights is expensive, so these packages often present good value for money.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a beginner looking for a general-use bike or are a dedicated commuter who prefers an upright position in traffic, a flat-bar hybrid is a great choice for you.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Pros</strong>: Fairly quick; hugely versatile; confidence-inspiring upright position</li>\n<li><strong>Cons</strong>: Not the lightest or most comfortable bike for longer distances</li>\n</ul><h3>3 of the best hybrid commuter bikes, as rated by our expert testers</h3>\n<p>This is a small selection of the best hybrid bikes for commuting.
