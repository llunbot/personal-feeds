Avona also will have a short travel Silva trail bike later this spring, and a Velum road bike in the works, too. But for now, let’s focus mostly on what will make this new Avona brand unique – what they describe as a holistic approach to creating complete bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, they have some killer limited artist edition paint jobs. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_limited-edition-artist-edition-paint-job.webp\"><img width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_limited-edition-artist-edition-paint-job.webp\" alt=\"All-new carbon Avona Callis fast gravel bike, limited edition paintjobs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_limited-edition-artist-edition-paint-job.webp 2100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_limited-edition-artist-edition-paint-job-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_limited-edition-artist-edition-paint-job-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_limited-edition-artist-edition-paint-job-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_limited-edition-artist-edition-paint-job-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_limited-edition-artist-edition-paint-job-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_limited-edition-artist-edition-paint-job-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_limited-edition-artist-edition-paint-job-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(All photos/Road Bike Connection Spring – Rupert Fowler)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, we’ll take a detailed look at that Callis…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who is Avona anyway?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_all-new-brand.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_all-new-brand.webp\" alt=\"All-new carbon Avona Callis fast gravel bike, who is Avona?\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_all-new-brand.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_all-new-brand-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_all-new-brand-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_all-new-brand-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_all-new-brand-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_all-new-brand-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_all-new-brand-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an obvious spoiler once you get a glimpse of the upcoming Avona Silva mountain bike. It’s such <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/arc8-evolve-fs-is-a-lightweight-progressive-xc-mtb-with-flex-stays-and-slider-suspension/\" target=\"_blank\">a unique design</a>, long-time Bikerumor readers will immediately recognize it, and put two and two together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So… Avona is the latest project of bike design engineer Jonas Müller – who co-founded ARC8 bikes with Serafin Pazdera in Switzerland <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/arc8-borrows-and-lends-big-brand-design-talent-for-new-dtc-carbon-road-mountain-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">back in 2019</a>. While still freelancing for ARC8 it seems, Jonas has paired up with product manager Max Koch to start another, entirely separate brand where they could design top-tier, high-performance bikes – complete bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, while ARC8 focuses mostly on frames/framesets, they created Avona to build complete bikes that maximized performance – from the rider to the components. There’s no point in having the fastest bike, if you don’t give it the fastest wheels, tires, and even chain treatment, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That seems like a no-brainer. But the vast majority of production complete bikes have their components picked by product managers, whose job is most often to balance: a target complete bike price, perceived value of spec’d brands, and often discount deals big component companies make to bundle together several products out of their catalog. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think for example, about how many top-end bikes get spec’d with a SRAM AXS drivetrain, Quarq power meter, Zipp wheels, and Zipp cockpit parts. Those are generally all solid, high-performing components. But no brand can make <em>all</em> the top-performing products in <em>all</em> categories. That’s why you’ll see a lot of mountain bike brands spec’ing SRAM drivetrains but Shimano brakes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s now where small Avona can be even more picky and choosy about every item they spec on a complete bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They describe it as “a holistic approach to performance”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What does that mean for the bike itself and the end consumer?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_descending.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_descending.webp\" alt=\"All-new carbon Avona Callis fast gravel bike, Cory riding downhill\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_descending.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_descending-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_descending-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_descending-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_descending-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, it starts long before component spec, even extending to the frame design, too. It means Avona takes an analytical look at design priorities. Light weight is great, but there’s no denying aerodynamics plays a big role in the power riders have to put out to move forward. So they take a more comprehensive look at data to define performance. Some of their key findings are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you are just looking at Watts or KiloJoules over a total ride, aerodynamics dominate</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you want to reduce efforts above FTP, other factors become more important</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For mountain bikes, descents are where the equipment can make the biggest difference</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We should never use anything but the best tires</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A waxed chain is worth more than an expensive groupset</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_fastest-Hutchinson-Caracal-Race-gravel-tire.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_fastest-Hutchinson-Caracal-Race-gravel-tire.webp\" alt=\"Avona holistic performance, fastest gravel tires Hutchinson Caracal Race\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_fastest-Hutchinson-Caracal-Race-gravel-tire.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_fastest-Hutchinson-Caracal-Race-gravel-tire-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_fastest-Hutchinson-Caracal-Race-gravel-tire-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_fastest-Hutchinson-Caracal-Race-gravel-tire-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_fastest-Hutchinson-Caracal-Race-gravel-tire-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_fastest-Hutchinson-Caracal-Race-gravel-tire-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So that ultimately fuels their bike specs. All bikes get aerodynamic optimization, even if they aren’t specifically aero bikes. Mountain bikes prioritize capable geometry and supple suspension over just chasing grams. Every bike comes spec’d with the best tires that Avona could find for each segment. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_factory-waxed-CeramicSpeed-chains.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_factory-waxed-CeramicSpeed-chains.webp\" alt=\"Avona holistic performance, fastest drivetrain CeramicSpeed waxed chains\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_factory-waxed-CeramicSpeed-chains.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_factory-waxed-CeramicSpeed-chains-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_factory-waxed-CeramicSpeed-chains-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_factory-waxed-CeramicSpeed-chains-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_factory-waxed-CeramicSpeed-chains-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_factory-waxed-CeramicSpeed-chains-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And every bike comes with a chain (and drivetrain) that has been cleaned of any factory grease, and coated with CeramicSpeed UFO wax to reduce drivetrain drag and keep it clean.

Aerodynamic tube shape optimization and fork to frame integration, but not to a level that results in extra weight or an overly stiff ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Avona Callis – Tech

Starting off, the framesets come in a standard Rosé:Blue fade paintjob or simple clearcoat over raw black UD carbon. There’s also a ready to paint version without clear as a blank canvas for custom paint jobs. And Avona will regularly run super limited editions like this #savethepostalservice artist series bike. Frameset prices start at 3600€, including a one-piece house-brand Faserwerk Luftschneider handlebar+stem cockpit combo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Complete gravel bikes are offered now with SRAM Red AXS Xplr, powermeter cranks, 50mm carbon DT Swiss GRC1100 wheels, the Faserwerk cockpit for 10,000€. Or pick a much more affordable Shimano GRX Di2 2x build with Faserwerk carbon gravel wheels for just 6000€.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_riding.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_riding.webp\" alt=\"All-new carbon Avona Callis fast gravel bike, Cory climbing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_riding.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_riding-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_riding-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_riding-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_riding-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-carbon-Avona-Callis-fast-gravel-bike_photo-by-Rupert-Fowler-Road-Bike-Connection-Spring_riding-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Three more complete builds will be available from June.

Force AXS with 50mm deep DT Swiss GRC1400 wheels for 7000€.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing the build customization, all SRAM builds can be swapped to a mullet setup with a GX AXS Eagle derailleur and 10-52T cassette at no extra cost. Bikes come standard with the Hutchinson Caracal Race semi-slick that Avona discovered was incredibly fast-rolling on <a href=\"https://www.bicyclerollingresistance.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle Rolling Resistance</a>. But you can also swap in Schwalbe G-One R or 35mm Continental GP 5000 TR road slicks if you prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All framesets &amp; complete bikes can also be tweaked for fit with stem length, bar width, crank length &amp; seatpost offset to suit the buyer. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Avona Silva lightweight carbon, short-travel trail mountain bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-Avona-Silva-lightweight-carbon-short-travel-trail-XC-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-Rupert-Fowler_riding.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-Avona-Silva-lightweight-carbon-short-travel-trail-XC-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-Rupert-Fowler_riding.webp\" alt=\"All-new carbon Avona Callis fast gravel bike_photo by Rupert Fowler-Road Bike Connection Spring_\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-Avona-Silva-lightweight-carbon-short-travel-trail-XC-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-Rupert-Fowler_riding.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-Avona-Silva-lightweight-carbon-short-travel-trail-XC-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-Rupert-Fowler_riding-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-Avona-Silva-lightweight-carbon-short-travel-trail-XC-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-Rupert-Fowler_riding-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-Avona-Silva-lightweight-carbon-short-travel-trail-XC-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-Rupert-Fowler_riding-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/All-new-Avona-Silva-lightweight-carbon-short-travel-trail-XC-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-Rupert-Fowler_riding-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming later this summer is a short travel full-suspension mountain bike that looks an awful lot like the ARC8 Evolve FS.
