Apple subsequently updated its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> rules to let music apps in the EEA inform users of other ways to purchase digital music content or services and to add website links for purchasing digital music subscriptions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has reportedly filed a suit at the EU's General Court in Luxembourg to challenge the March decision. The Commission told reporters it is ready to defend its decision in court.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen the fine was issued, Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/the-app-store-spotify-and-europes-thriving-digital-music-market/?1709553731\">said</a> the decision was reached \"despite the Commission's failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm.\" Apple also said that the ruling \"ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also said that three different related cases mounted against it by the Commission over the past eight years consistently found no evidence of consumer harm and no evidence of anti-competitive behavior.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe fine brought to a close a long-running investigation by the EU, triggered by a complaint from Spotify in 2015 into Apple's treatment of third-party music streaming services on the ‌App Store‌. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/apple-fights-2-billion-eu-fine-spotify/\">Apple Challenges $2 Billion EU Antitrust Fine Over Spotify Complaint</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-challenges-2-billion-eu-antitrust-fine-over-spotify-complaint.2427000/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"00a3f9587fa824cedf9f452e20b5c248933dcb5bb9a70f7cc372d5266eeda753","category":"Apple"}
