Not only does he usually have new product to show us, but it’s always a fascinating conversation covering all aspects of the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the product side, Abbey has always focused on making professional tools for professional mechanics on the go. Now, those professional mechanics who hold down the local shops are getting some love with some new shop-specific tools. Jason calls these “the right tool for the right application. These aren’t the Team Issue tools made with exotic materials.” Instead, these are for stationary mechanics who desire ultimate durability over lightweight portability. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Abbey Shop Whip-It &amp; Shop Crombie Tool</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, Abbey has introduced the Shop Whip-It and the Shop Crombie tool. Both are fully heat-treated, compared to the standard Crombie and Whip, which used a heat-treated head on the Crombie tool. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-09.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-09-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Abbey Bike Tools Shop Crombie\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-09-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-09-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-09-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-09-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-09-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-09-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-09-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Shop Whip-It has a reinforced head with more material around the chain connection points, only machined down where it has to be.

That spoke wrench is now available in a three-sided version, with a four-sided version coming soon. Initially, Abbey made the prototype out of solid aluminum just to speed the prototyping process, knowing that the final product would have a steel reinforcement for the nipple slot. While the aluminum models held up surprisingly well, the production versions have the steel reinforcement as promised, and are offered in the 3.23mm size, which is the equivalent of the black spoke wrench from Park Tool. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-02.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-02-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Abbey Spoke Wrench with dt Swiss bladed spoke holder\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-02-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-02-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-02-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-02-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-02-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-02-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abbey-Bike-Tools-Shop-Whip-Crombie-spoke-wrench-magnet-chain-keeper-v-02-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spoke Wrench is designed to play well with the DT Swiss bladed spoke holder, and the Abbey Spoke Wrench is priced at $53. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.abbeybiketools.com\" target=\"_blank\">abbeybiketools.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/abbey-heavy-duty-shop-whip-it-crombie-tool-reinforced-spoke-wrench/\">Abbey Gets Heavy Duty with Shop Whip-It &amp; Crombie Tool, Reinforced Spoke Wrench</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"483e70595043b6dfe20abeeffce65775c243e71b61fff9763f2f8c2441259b23","category":"Cycling"}
