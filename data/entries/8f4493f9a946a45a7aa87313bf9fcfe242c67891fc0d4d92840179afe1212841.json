In this case, he turned his attention to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/07/ibm-pc-history-part-2/\">MS-DOS</a>, a text-only operating system first released in 1981, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/\">ChatGPT</a>, an AI-powered large language model (LLM) released by OpenAI in November.</p>\n\n<p>As a conversational AI model, ChatGPT draws on knowledge scraped from the Internet to answer questions and generate text. Thanks to an API that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/chatgpt-and-whisper-apis-debut-allowing-devs-to-integrate-them-into-apps/\">launched his month</a>, anyone with the programming chops can interface ChatGPT with their own custom application.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927046#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927046&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8f4493f9a946a45a7aa87313bf9fcfe242c67891fc0d4d92840179afe1212841","category":"Tech"}
