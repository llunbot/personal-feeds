SpaceX won a $2.6 billion contract for essentially the same scope of work.</p>\n<p>A decade later the Starliner program finds itself at a crossroads after Boeing learned it will not complete the spacecraft's first Crew Flight Test with astronauts onboard. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/its-official-nasa-calls-on-crew-dragon-to-rescue-the-starliner-astronauts/\">NASA formally decided Saturday</a> that Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who launched on the Starliner capsule June 5, will instead return to Earth inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. Put simply, NASA isn't confident enough in Boeing's spacecraft after it suffered multiple thruster failures and helium leaks on the way to the ISS.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045136#p3\">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045136&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb2e6fbd074f8b03872f3f5c902fddf63ca23dd124a0e9c279a5b8eb0e2ec584","category":"Tech"}
