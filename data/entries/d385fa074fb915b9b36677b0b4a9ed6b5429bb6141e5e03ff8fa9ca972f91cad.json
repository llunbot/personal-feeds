The paper written by its proponents makes that difficult to tell.

So, biologists tend to be slightly leery of even serious attempts at theorizing about bringing the two fields closer.</p>\n<p>Yet this October has seen two papers that claim to describe how a key component of evolutionary theory—selection—fits in with other areas of physics. Both papers are published in prestigious journals (Nature and PNAS), so they can't be summarily dismissed. But they're both pretty limited in ways that probably are the product of the interests and biases of their authors. And one of them may be the worst written paper I've ever seen in a major journal.</p>\n<p>So buckle up, and let's dive into the world of theoretical biology.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976439#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976439&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d385fa074fb915b9b36677b0b4a9ed6b5429bb6141e5e03ff8fa9ca972f91cad","category":"Tech"}
