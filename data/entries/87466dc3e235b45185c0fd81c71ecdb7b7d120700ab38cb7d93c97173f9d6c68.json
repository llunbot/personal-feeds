And that’s exactly how we felt when we found this decked-out deal: <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1793632-REG/apple_muw63ll_a_16_macbook_pro_m3.html\">B&amp;H Photo is selling the 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro for $3,399</a>, a massive $600 off its $3,999 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, that’s hardly cheap, but this is an absolutely spectacular configuration. With a 20-core CPU, 40-core GPU, 48GB RAM, and 1TB of storage, you’ll pretty much be working on a rocket. It’s the absolute top end of performance for this generation and will serve you well for years to come. It’s also got incredible battery life and of course, is ready for Apple Intelligence as it continues its rollout throughout 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, it’s not the latest model with the M4 chip, but the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2124958/16-inch-macbook-pro-m3-max-review.html\">top-of-the-line M3 Max</a> is nothing to turn your nose at, either. Also note that this MacBook Pro also has a Thunderbolt 4 rather than the newer generation the M4 models come with, but right now, Thunderbolt 5 accessories are very still slim and expensive anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and take advantage of this rare discount and <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1793632-REG/apple_muw63ll_a_16_macbook_pro_m3.html\">save a jaw-dropping $600 on one of Apple’s best-ever laptops</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get a huge discount on a high-end MacBook Pro</span><div><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1793632-REG/apple_muw63ll_a_16_macbook_pro_m3.html\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at B&amp;H</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"87466dc3e235b45185c0fd81c71ecdb7b7d120700ab38cb7d93c97173f9d6c68","category":"Apple"}
