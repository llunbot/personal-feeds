Some users have continued to experience Wi-Fi issues on iOS 17.1.1, released earlier this month, so perhaps iOS 17.1.2 will include the same <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/ios-17-2-beta-addresses-wifi-issues/\">fix for Wi-Fi connectivity issues</a> that Apple included in the iOS 17.2 beta. Some users have also experienced minor bugs related to push notifications and HomeKit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple typically does not release any software updates or betas during the week of U.S. Thanksgiving, as most corporate employees in the company are given the full week off due to the holiday. This means that iOS 17.1.2 is likely to be released next week, similar to how iOS 16.1.2 was released on November 30 last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.1.1 already <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-ios-17-1-1/\">fixed a BMW wireless charging issue</a> affecting the iPhone 15 lineup, and an issue preventing the Weather app widget from showing a snow icon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.2 has been in beta testing for nearly a month now, and it is expected to be released in mid-December. The update includes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-2-beta-features/\">many new features and changes</a>, including Apple's new Journal app, support for spatial video recording on iPhone 15 Pro models, a Translate option for the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro models, the ability for Apple Music subscribers to collaborate on playlists, an iMessage Contact Key Verification security option for high-profile individuals, additional Weather and Clock widgets, and more.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/apple-preparing-ios-17-1-2/\">Apple Preparing to Release iOS 17.1.2 Update for iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-to-release-ios-17-1-2-update-for-iphone.2411534/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"82831e674ce18370dc63834568af5d9000944843cc4f2f1651ab2f78b3e308e5","category":"Apple"}
