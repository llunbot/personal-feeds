Yes, I attribute that to spending a lot of time in the sun, riding with inadequate amounts of food, and <em>some </em>day drinking, but it’s a whirlwind of catching up with everyone. It’s almost like a class reunion, except you’re genuinely excited to see the people and hear about what they’ve been up to. However, there are some standouts and new friends to be made. This year, there were quite a few. Not only new friends/riding buddies, but projects, companies, and ideas that challenge the conventional tech train of thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-faith--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-faith--scaled.webp\" alt=\"NICH frame faith\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-faith--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-faith--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-faith--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-faith--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-faith--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-faith--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(All photos: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>NICH Cycling </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NICH Cycling was a booth that caught my eye at the Sea Otter Classic. It was mainly this super cool paint job. NICH is making its official entry into the U.S. market, and it’s a serious move. The bikes look fantastic, and they already have a large following in Thailand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"NICH frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-bars--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-bars--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"NICH frame bars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-bars--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-bars--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-bars--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-bars--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-bars--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-saddle--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-saddle--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"NICH frame saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-saddle--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-saddle--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-saddle--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-saddle--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NICH-frame-saddle--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Chinatip Boonchokhirunmetha founded NICH, and this is where the company gets its name.

The paint job is striking in the sun, and the overall silhouette of the frame is elegant. I wandered into the booth, eyeing more bikes and top-tier builds. I’m excited to see what NICH has to offer, and we have a review ride on order, so stay tuned for more. <a href=\"https://www.nichcycling.com/\">Oh, and they make some good-looking wheels, too.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-carbon-sole--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-carbon-sole--scaled.webp\" alt=\"VElo Vetta Shoes carbon sole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-carbon-sole--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-carbon-sole--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-carbon-sole--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-carbon-sole--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-carbon-sole--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-carbon-sole--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Velo Vetta Shoes </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I was walking by my buddies at WOVE Saddles <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wove-mags-saddle-review-gravel-road-race-aero/\">(makers of our favorite $595 saddle)</a> when I came across a booth with some extremely interesting footwear.

The shoes use a cam-style system, which makes it more aerodynamic (hopefully) and takes the pressure off the forefoot. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-weight--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-weight--scaled.webp\" alt=\"VElo Vetta Shoes weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-weight--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-weight--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-weight--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-weight--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-weight--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-weight--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VElo-Vetta-Shoes-weight--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The design is unique and serviceable, it seems. They are slightly heavier than the top-tier road shoes currently on the market, but there have been rumors about lighter models possibly being introduced in the future. We’ll have to wait and see, but as of right now, Velo Vetta has our attention. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MF-MBW-full--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MF-MBW-full--scaled.webp\" alt=\"MF MBW full\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MF-MBW-full--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MF-MBW-full--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MF-MBW-full--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MF-MBW-full--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MF-MBW-full--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MF-MBW-full--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mountain Flow Mobile Bike Wash (MBW)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this isn’t uncharted territory for most cleaning and lube companies. You need to wash the bike and have water. If you don’t have water, you can bring it; as a bonus, you can pair it with a sprayer for added convenience. However, sometimes you don’t need the full power and volume of a pressure washer. Certainly not if you’re spraying off your doggo. The new washer has a five-gallon capacity and can last up to 60 minutes on a full charge. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plant-based-chain-lube-mountainflow-ecowax.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"901\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plant-based-chain-lube-mountainflow-ecowax.jpg\" alt=\"plant based chain lube bike cleaning products eco friendly mountainflowecowax\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plant-based-chain-lube-mountainflow-ecowax.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plant-based-chain-lube-mountainflow-ecowax-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plant-based-chain-lube-mountainflow-ecowax-800x601.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plant-based-chain-lube-mountainflow-ecowax-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plant-based-chain-lube-mountainflow-ecowax-768x577.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Mountain Flow typically focuses on the lube, cleaning, and biodegradable water bottle categories. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mountain Flow washer will shine in these little washes. We’ve tested it, and it delivers real water pressure, somewhere between that of a garden hose and a gas-powered pressure washer. So it’ll blast off dirt, grime, and peanut butter mud without eating your decals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Built from burly rotomolded HDPE, the <a href=\"https://mountainflow.com/products/mobile-bike-wash?srsltid=AfmBOoqzGqs_jjTNu_wIbVQokvV6lTP1SPk0kcCpWGVmxsRCjeUY9FUg\">Mountain Flow MBW</a> is tough enough to bounce around in your trunk all season long. It runs on a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that cranks out 60 minutes of spray time—enough for six full cleaning tanks, whether rinsing off post-ride grime or knocking dust off camp gear. It charges via a wall plug or your car’s 12V outlet, so you’re never left without power. All that trailhead convenience clocks in at $299.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velo Toze gravel vest\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>VeloToze Hydration Pack</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>VeloToze caught our eye with its all-new<a href=\"https://www.velotoze.com/products/hydro-vest?srsltid=AfmBOoocBYgqCPRk_7Vni2n0T1uiAy4koUsQ-nY4ACtOMzgiNxUWmphz\"> HydroVest</a>. Designed as an advanced base layer with a hydration reservoir built in, it tucks neatly under your jersey for a sleek, aerodynamic fit. The idea? Ditch the bulky hydration packs and gain some free speed, especially when every watt counts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-front--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-front--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velo Toze gravel vest front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-front--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-front--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-front--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-front--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-front--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-front--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-front--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While we didn’t get to ride with it, the HydroVest feels like a clever bit of crossover tech. It’s built from soft, breathable, antibacterial fabric, and when filled with chilled water or slush, it doubles as a cooling vest—something we could’ve used during those hot, dusty afternoons in Monterey. The rear-mounted reservoir appears stable enough for off-road use, and VeloToze claims it offers an aerodynamic advantage in time trials due to its slim front profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-tip--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-tip--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velo Toze gravel vest tip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-tip--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-tip--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-tip--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-tip--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-tip--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-tip--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Velo-Toze-gravel-vest-tip--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From what we saw, the HydroVest appears to be purpose-built for everything from road racing to gravel epics. The under-jersey design keeps things tidy and secure, and if the performance matches the promise, this could be a real game-changer for on-the-go hydration. The reservoir is not included in the $65.00 price tag. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-line-up--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-line-up--scaled.webp\" alt=\"TPU Tube line up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-line-up--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-line-up--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-line-up--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-line-up--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-line-up--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-line-up--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-line-up--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aeron Tubes TPU Tubes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These guys are making a bold claim: they have the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aeron-tpu-inner-tubes/\">world’s best TPU inner tubes</a>. Built with an actual multi-layer construction, their road tubes start at an insanely light 22g. This is the first time we’ve laid hands on the tubes, and it’s pretty amazing. Oh, and they brought a scale so you can check the weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-threaded--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-threaded--scaled.webp\" alt=\"TPU Tube threaded\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-threaded--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-threaded--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-threaded--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-threaded--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-threaded--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-threaded--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-threaded--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re touting significant gains in rolling resistance, as well as improved puncture protection and air retention, compared to traditional butyl rubber. They’re positioning the whole system as a simpler, lower-cost alternative to going tubeless, especially when you factor in maintenance and mess. I’ll still keep lightweight tubes as a backup for my tubeless setup, but this lineup offers some compelling options.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-weight--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-weight--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"TPU Tube weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-weight--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-weight--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-weight--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-weight--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-weight--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-tip--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-tip--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"TPU Tube tip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-tip--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-tip--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-tip--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-tip--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-tip--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TPU-Tube-tip--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aeron says TPU is 100% recyclable and can be turned back into new TPU tubes.

They are super easy to use, the rack is great for transport, and the people behind the brand are top-notch. So we rolled over to their booth, snagged some coffee, and poked around at the newest offerings. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AHHA-bike-stand.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AHHA-bike-stand.jpg\" alt=\"ahha folding bike stand\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AHHA-bike-stand.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AHHA-bike-stand-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AHHA-bike-stand-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AHHA-bike-stand-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AHHA-bike-stand-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We saw an update and a more cost-effective version of the current Toaster rack (pictured above). I love the Toaster; it’s excellent for races when you’re strapping bikes to your car, and if you’re traveling with the family or ride crew and looking for a bike parking spot at base camp. The current <a href=\"https://ahha.bike/collections/all-products\">Toaster runs about $230</a>, and that’s a painted and fully decked-out design. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AHHA-rack-front--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AHHA-rack-front--scaled.webp\" alt=\"AHHA rack front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AHHA-rack-front--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AHHA-rack-front--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AHHA-rack-front--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AHHA-rack-front--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AHHA-rack-front--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AHHA-rack-front--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This stripped-down version will likely be less, but we’re not 100% sure of the pricing. We also noticed some super cool custom AHHA racks around the Sea Otter Classic. MAVIC had one, and it was awesome. That will also be an excellent option, but we’ll have to wait and see!  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-tube--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-tube--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Tire rotator with tube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-tube--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-tube--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-tube--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-tube--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-tube--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-tube--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-tube--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spinning Edge Tech – Tire Rotator</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is one of those tools or gadgets that if money were no option, I would have in my shop. But when I thought about it, I was like “yeah, this would be helpful”. It’s not often, but sometimes I set up tires as if I’m on a game show, being timed – total madness. When I inflate them to the pressure I want and roll them out the door, a small leak can occur. It’s happened on more than one occasion, and I’ll never learn my lesson. However, I’m guessing the Tire Rotator could have been helpful. Is this tool a <em>“must-have”?</em> Probably not, but it’s very cool, and the people behind it are very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-roller--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-roller--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Tire rotator with roller\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-roller--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-roller--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-roller--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-roller--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-roller--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-roller--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tire-rotator-with-roller--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But what does it do exactly? Essentially, you place the Tire Rotator wheel with sealant on your bike or in a work stand, holding the tool in place. Then, align the wheel and tire edge with the turning drum (which resembles a paint roller) and turn on the Tire Rotator machine. The machine spins the wheel and will gently cover the inside of your tire with sealant slowly and evenly. No need to flip, it covers evenly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.spinning-edge.com/home\">You can sign up here for more information. </a> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/interesting-sea-otter-finds-nich-bikes-aero-road-shoes-and-a-spinning-tire-sealant-applicator/\">Interesting Sea Otter Finds: NICH Bikes, Aero Road Shoes, and a Spinning Tire Sealant Applicator?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"c99aafcf98da9b54a26cb4acea9a8ae1ab31da2f247b0fa8119adc4e19565ee1","category":"Cycling"}
