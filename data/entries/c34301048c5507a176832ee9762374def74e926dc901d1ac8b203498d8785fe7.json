Discovery (WBD) and Paramount Global are no longer considering a merger that would have put the Max and Paramount+ streaming services under one corporate umbrella. Per a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/warner-bros-discovery-halts-paramount-global-merger-talks.html\">CNBC</a> report today citing anonymous “people familiar with the matter,\" WBD and Paramount had been mulling a merger for “several months.\"</p>\n<p>In December, reports started swirling about WBD and Paramount <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/debt-laden-warner-bros-discovery-and-paramount-consider-merger/\">discussing a potential merger</a>. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/12/20/warner-bros-paramount-merger-discovery-streaming\">Axios</a> even reported that WBD CEO David Zaslav and Paramount CEO Bob Bakish met in person for “several hours” and that Zaslav also met with Shari Redstone, the owner of National Amusements Inc. (NAI), Paramount’s parent company. Now, CNBC reports that discussions between the media giants “cooled off this month.” Paramount and WBD haven’t commented.</p>\n<p>When news of the potential merger dropped, it was unclear what sort of regulatory hurdles the media conglomerates might have faced if they tried becoming one. Combined, the companies would have had the second-biggest streaming business by subscriber count, trailing Netflix.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006753#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006753&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c34301048c5507a176832ee9762374def74e926dc901d1ac8b203498d8785fe7","category":"Tech"}
