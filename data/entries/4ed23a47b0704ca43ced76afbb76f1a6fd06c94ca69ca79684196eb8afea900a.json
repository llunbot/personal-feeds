But we'll get a chance to see another, smaller film from the directors this month on Netflix: <em>The Electric State</em>, adapted from the graphic novel by Swedish artist/designer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_St%C3%A5lenhag\">Simon Stålenhag</a>.</p>\n<p>Stålenhag's stunningly surreal neofuturistic art—featured in his narrative art books, 2014's <em>Tales from the Loop</em> and 2016's <em>Things From the Flood</em>—inspired the 2020 eight-episode series <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/tech-takes-a-back-seat-to-interconnected-human-stories-in-tales-from-the-loop/\"><em>Tales From the Loop</em></a>, in which residents of a rural town find themselves grappling with strange occurrences thanks to the presence of an underground particle accelerator. That adaptation captured the mood and tone of the art that inspired it and received Emmy nominations for cinematography and special visual effects.</p>\n<p><em>The Electric State</em> was Stålenhag's third such book, published in 2018 and set in a similar dystopian, ravaged landscape. Paragraphs of text, accompanied by larger artworks, tell the story of a teen girl named Michelle who must travel across the country with her robot companion to find her long-lost brother, while being pursued by a federal agent. The Russo brothers acquired the rights early on and initially intended to make the film with Universal, but when the studio decided it would not be giving the film a theatrical release, Netflix bought the distribution rights.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/humans-and-bots-take-on-the-system-in-the-electric-state-trailer/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/humans-and-bots-take-on-the-system-in-the-electric-state-trailer/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4ed23a47b0704ca43ced76afbb76f1a6fd06c94ca69ca79684196eb8afea900a","category":"Tech"}
