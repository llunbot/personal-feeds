The Eight was first released in 2016 as a commuter bike, but the model was later revised into a fully featured, all-season commuter called the Continuum Onyx. Priority is now releasing an all-new Eight, which has evolved into a sport hybrid bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Eight was created to offer a balance of speed and comfort. This bike is ideal for fitness, recreational riding, and commuting. As with all of Priority’s bikes, the Eight is built with durability in mind and with very little maintenance required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2017, I received a <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-priority-bicycles-gates-belt-driven-continuum-is-a-low-maintenance-commuter/\">Priority Continuum</a></strong> for testing, and the company let me keep for long-term testing. After plenty of riding and several winters of storage under my home, the bike is still running great with basically no maintenance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Priority Eight- Drivetrain:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-Alfine-hub.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-Alfine-hub.jpg\" alt=\"Priority Bicycles Eight, Shimano Alfine hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-Alfine-hub.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-Alfine-hub-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-Alfine-hub-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-Alfine-hub-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-Alfine-hub-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-Alfine-hub-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eight’s name comes from the bike’s 8-speed internally geared Shimano Alfine rear hub. The hub provides a 307% gear range, which Priority says is ample for climbing hills and recreational cruising. The Alfine hub is sealed to protect its internals from the elements. Gear changes are controlled by a trigger shifter, and the Alfine hub can change gears while riding or at a standstill.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-trigger-shifter.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-trigger-shifter.jpg\" alt=\"Priority Bicycles Eight, trigger shifter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-trigger-shifter.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-trigger-shifter-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-trigger-shifter-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-trigger-shifter-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-trigger-shifter-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-trigger-shifter-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As with all of Priority’s bikes, the hub is driven by a low-maintenance Gates Carbon Drive Belt. Gates’ drive belts last 2-3x longer than standard chains, require no lubrication and offer a smooth pedaling experience. Priority equips the small frames with 170mm crank arms but jumps to 175mm arms for medium and large bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frame and Components:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-side-studio.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"679\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-side-studio.jpg\" alt=\"Priority Bicycles Eight, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-side-studio.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-side-studio-297x168.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-side-studio-800x453.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-side-studio-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-side-studio-768x435.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eight offers a 6061 aluminum frame with a carbon fiber fork. The bike rolls on 700x32c WTB Slick tires, which are puncture-resistant and include reflective sidewalls. The Eight gets 32-spoke, double-walled aluminum rims with a sealed bearing hub in the front wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>174HUDSON dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes with 160mm rotors ensure powerful, all-weather stopping performance (Please note – Tektro brakes are shown in the photos).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eight gets a 620mm wide aluminum handlebar, and stems are either 80mm reach (small frame) or 90mm (medium and large frames).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-seat-post.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-seat-post.jpg\" alt=\"Priority Bicycles Eight, seat and post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-seat-post.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-seat-post-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-seat-post-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-seat-post-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-seat-post-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-seat-post-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the carbon fork, a carbon seatpost helps absorb vibrations to offer a comfortable ride. Priority equips the Eight with the highly popular WTB Volt saddle. Silicone foam grips also help absorb road vibrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-pedals.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-pedals.jpg\" alt=\"Priority Bicycles Eight, pedal, mounts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-pedals.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-pedals-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-pedals-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-pedals-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-pedals-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-pedals-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Priority includes pedals on the Eight, and they’re not a budget plastic set – You get aluminum platform pedals with chromoly spindles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eight’s frame includes multiple braze-on mounts for racks, fenders (which are not included on this model), child seats, and water bottles. An aluminum kickstand is also included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight for the complete Eight is listed at just 27 lbs, so it won’t be too difficult to haul it upstairs or load onto a bike rack.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry/Sizing:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-rider-front.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-rider-front.jpg\" alt=\"Priority Bicycles Eight, rider, front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-rider-front.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-rider-front-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-rider-front-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-rider-front-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-rider-front-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Priority-Eight-rider-front-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eight is available in three frame sizes – small (17”), medium (19”), and large (21”), which should cover riders from 5’2” to 6’3”.
