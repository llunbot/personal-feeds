The series debuts January 2, 2022. </p></div>\n<p>Jules Verne's 1873 novel, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days\"><em>Around the World in Eighty Days</em></a>, inspired numerous real-life attempts to navigate the globe, as well as myriad film, TV, and radio adaptations of varying success. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_80_Days_(2022_TV_series)\">latest TV adaption</a> by the BBC stars a perfectly cast David Tennant as the globe-trotting adventurer Phileas Fogg, and judging from the preview, it looks like a particularly entertaining way to kick of the new year.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for the 1873 Jules Verne novel below.)</strong></p>\n<p>Fogg is the novel's main protagonist, a gentleman of modest fortune who gets into an argument with his pals at the Reform Club overÂ a newspaper article about the opening of a new railway section in India. The article claims this makes it possible to circumnavigate the world in 80 days. Fogg's colleagues are skeptical, so he makes a wager that he can accomplish the feat. It's a significant wager, too, amounting to half of Fogg's fortune, with the other half required to finance his journey. If he doesn't succeed, he will be ruined. Fogg takes his new valet, Passepartout, with him, departing London by train. Complicating matters is a Scotland Yard detective named Fix, who mistakes Fogg for a fugitive bank robber and tracks the pair throughout their travels.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1816190#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1816190&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"786967665a716c9adcd265b2c2b2deb90ddd7a68dc8f5f022ea84fba8156c091","category":"Tech"}
