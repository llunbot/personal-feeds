range.</p>\n<p>The new bike has <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">165mm of rear-suspension travel</a> and drops the single-pivot suspension system for the Strange Power Link system first seen on the Switch 7.</p>\n<p>Only the Stage 7 LE will be available at launch, priced at £7,400/$9,000/€8,300 and featuring a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/fox-38-factory-grip2-fork-review/\">Fox Factory 38 fork</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/rear-shocks/fox-float-x2-factory-2pos-adjust-2022-review/\">Float X2 Factory shock</a>.</p>\n<p>Orange says other models will be available in late summer, including a frame-only option.</p>\n<h2>Strange Linkage?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Orange Stage 7 Strange linkage\" title=\"Orange Stage 7 Strange linkage\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The shock is mounted parallel to the down tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orange Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>Orange is famed for its single-pivot dedication, with the brand still recognising it as a part of its identity.</p>\n<p>That being said, the new bike, which sits above the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/orange-stage-6-rs-long-term-review/\">Stage 6</a> in terms of travel, has adopted Orange’s Strange (Special Technology RANGE) linkage-driven <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">suspension system</a>.</p>\n<p>Orange says it made this decision because it allows for a considerably more progressive shock curve that adds a bottomless feeling to the bike’s suspension and enables the leverage ratio to fall from 3.04 to 2.32.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Orange Stage 7 Strange linkage\" title=\"Orange Stage 7 Strange linkage\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Strange link is made from a CNC’d block of aluminium.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orange Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>The Strange Power Link is positioned low down in the bike’s frame, with Orange saying this allows for neutral weight distribution, while lowering the bike’s centre of gravity.</p>\n<p>The new linkage gives the bike 165mm of rear travel and uses a 205x60mm trunnion shock mount.</p>\n<p>The front of the bike has been designed to accommodate a 170mm fork, though it’s not clear whether this is the maximum amount the frame can accept.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Orange Stage 7 catching some air\" title=\"Orange Stage 7 catching some air\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Orange says the Stage 7 has been designed with speed in mind.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orange Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>The Stage 7 is made from seam-welded 6061-T6 aluminium tubing, with the linkage CNC’d from a block of aluminium.</p>\n<p>Orange hasn’t provided a weight for the frameset, but claims this construction enables the frame to weigh less than its carbon fibre counterparts.</p>\n<p>Orange also says the material is better for the environment once the bike has reached the end of its use life, because aluminium is widely recycled.</p>\n<p>Not that Orange expects that time to come quickly, with the brand offering a five-year frame warranty.</p>\n<div>\n    <img

protect the frame while damping chain slap.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orange Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>The rear triangle features an asymmetrical swingarm that increases the bike’s vertical stiffness while allowing for lateral compliance.</p>\n<p>Orange claims this improves grip, while retaining a direct feel through the bike.</p>\n<p>The frame has down tube protection to fend off stone chips and chainstay protection to dampen chain slap.</p>\n<h2>Orange Stage 7 geometry and sizing</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Orange Stage 7 on corrugated iron hut\"
