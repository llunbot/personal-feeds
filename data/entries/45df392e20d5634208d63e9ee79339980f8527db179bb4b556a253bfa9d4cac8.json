The major changes include a unified scrollable interface that replaces the traditional tab system, smart collections that automatically group photos by occasions like \"Recent Days\" and \"Trips,\" and significantly enhanced search capabilities that understand natural language queries.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-navigating-redesigned-photos-app/\">How to Navigate the Redesigned Photos App</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-use-natural-language-search-photos/\">How to Use Natural Language Search in Photos</a></li></ul>\r<br />\n<h2>Photos Redesign Draws Common Criticisms</h2>\r<br />\nThese changes are supposed to accurately represent Apple's vision for a more intelligent photo management system, but reception remains decidedly mixed. Many users have found the transition jarring, with several recurring complaints emerging across social media and Apple community feedback:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n    <li>A cluttered interface that makes finding specific photos difficult</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Confusion from redundant auto-generated albums and collections</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Photos and videos no longer defaulting to full-screen viewing mode</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Removal of traditional navigation tabs like \"Library\" and \"Albums\"</li>\r<br />\n    <li>Overemphasis on AI features at the expense of simple organization</li>\r<br />\n</ul>In response to both pre- and post-release feedback, Apple has implemented several updates through iOS 18 betas and point releases. For example, the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-beta-5-photos-app/\">removed</a> the controversial Carousel feature that displayed daily highlights, reintroduced the familiar pinch-to-zoom navigational gesture, and will soon improve the video player interface by <a href=\"https://x.com/BetaProfiles/status/1856049453515583694\">removing the borders during playback</a>. But is it enough?\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ipados-18-photos-app.jpg\" width=\"2153\" height=\"1211\" />\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-customize-reorder-photos-app/\">How to Customize and Reorder the Photos App</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThe Photos app represents one of the most significant overhauls to a core iOS app in recent years. Some argue it was a step in the right direction, but others see it as a regressive move prompted by Apple's rivals offering more and more AI-oriented photography features. We'd love to hear your thoughts on the Photos app redesign.
