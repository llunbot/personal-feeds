There is a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/graylog2/csLsSJTg6j0/g_Kl4OS2AwAJ\">neat workaround suggested by Drew Miranda</a>Â that can fulfil this functionality. I'll try to rephrase it step by step.<br />\n<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Graylog UI page</li>\n<li>Make a search for the field and value that you want to represent as a chart</li>\n<li>Around the bottom left corner of search page, click <b>all fields</b></li>\n<li>Find <b>timestamp</b> field and generate chart from it</li>\n<li>Around top right of the chart, Customize &gt; Value &gt; Total</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\nThat's it for a single value chart. But if you want a chart to contain multiple values, keeps going</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Redo 2-5 again for different fields</li>\n<li>Click and hold on <b>hamburger menu button</b> at the top right of each, drag to merge them</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\nThat's neat right?</div>\n<div>\n<br /></div>\n","author":"Tap","siteTitle":"tAp's blog","siteHash":"ec0b5758aa5280680c8b6839677ce27021dd9d4295725ce4f0e9f298aad77c91","entryHash":"6dbe2ae1a2c3a59ba7bfe4ec8ddbcf8e4d46694fb4a198442ebee99bf62712f8","category":"Thai"}
