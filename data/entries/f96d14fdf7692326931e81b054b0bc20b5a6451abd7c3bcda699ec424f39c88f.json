Now, they’re expanding that strategy by teaming up with the largest online retailer in the world. For U.S. customers, this could mean faster delivery, easier access, and less friction when pulling the trigger on a new ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-on-Amazon-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1718\" height=\"1028\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-on-Amazon-.png\" alt=\"Canyon on Amazon\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-on-Amazon-.png 1718w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-on-Amazon--297x178.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-on-Amazon--1536x919.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-on-Amazon--120x72.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canyon-on-Amazon--768x460.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>So, what’s actually available?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon’s Amazon storefront currently features a curated selection of its popular models—think commuter e-bikes like the Roadlite:ON, gravel grinders like the Grizl, and urban cruisers—with more reportedly on the way. These aren’t stripped-down versions either; they come fully loaded, just like if you ordered straight from Canyon’s site. The price points look aligned with Canyon’s own listings, and yes, shipping is Prime-eligible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Canyon had explained that this Amazon partnership is meant for the more affordable spectrum of their bikes (think: less than $3500 or so) and focused exclusively on mountain bikes, city bikes, and other all-rounder bikes and bikes bikes. The goal is really just to make affordable bikes easier to access for more riders, while maintaining all of the customer service you get directly from Canyon. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Canyon-Spectral-AL-aluminum-all-mountain-trail-bike_Sam-with-a-custom-build.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Canyon-Spectral-AL-aluminum-all-mountain-trail-bike_Sam-with-a-custom-build.webp\" alt=\"2025 Canyon Spectral AL trail bike is simple &amp; capable in affordable aluminum, Sam shredding on her custom build with personal sponsors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Canyon-Spectral-AL-aluminum-all-mountain-trail-bike_Sam-with-a-custom-build.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Canyon-Spectral-AL-aluminum-all-mountain-trail-bike_Sam-with-a-custom-build-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Canyon-Spectral-AL-aluminum-all-mountain-trail-bike_Sam-with-a-custom-build-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Canyon-Spectral-AL-aluminum-all-mountain-trail-bike_Sam-with-a-custom-build-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Canyon-Spectral-AL-aluminum-all-mountain-trail-bike_Sam-with-a-custom-build-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Canyon-Spectral-AL-aluminum-all-mountain-trail-bike_Sam-with-a-custom-build-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Canyon-Spectral-AL-aluminum-all-mountain-trail-bike_Sam-with-a-custom-build-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What does this mean for riders?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Frankly, it’s not all that different for the ‘already consumer-direct’ bike brand to make their bikes available through the USA’s most popular direct to consumer shopping platform. And even though you buy through Amazon, you still get the full Canyon warranty and customer care directly from the bike maker. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever hesitated to purchase a Canyon because of long delivery timelines, import fees, or concerns over the buying process, this might be the nudge you needed. With Amazon’s backing, the path from “add to cart” to “ready to rip” just got smoother. Canyon will still handle service, warranty, and support directly—Amazon’s just one more distribution channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while we’re not seeing race machines like the Aeroad or Lux Trail on there just yet, the move suggests Canyon’s opening the throttle on accessibility, maybe even testing the waters for broader market expansion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For now, Canyon plans to limit this only to more ‘entry-level’ bikes, and doesn’t yet include their dedicated road platforms. The Amazon distribution deal is also US-specific with no immediate plans to do the same in their home European market. But it’s not entirely unheard of for them to partner with other delivery pathways – they have had a similar quick ship functioning for a while to consumers in China. So we’ll see where this goes next. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>The bottom line is that <strong>you can now buy a Canyon bike with your groceries</strong>.
