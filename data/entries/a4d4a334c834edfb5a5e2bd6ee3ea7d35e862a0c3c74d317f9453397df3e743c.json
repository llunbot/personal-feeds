{"title":"Chinese Government Hackers Compromise ‘Back Door for the Good Guys’ in U.S. Communication Networks","link":"https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/u-s-wiretap-systems-targeted-in-china-linked-hack-327fc63b","date":1728340521000,"content":"\n<p>Sarah Krouse, Dustin Volz, Aruna Viswanatha, and Robert McMillan, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For months or longer, the hackers might have held access to\nnetwork infrastructure used to cooperate with lawful U.S. requests\nfor communications data, according to people familiar with the\nmatter, which amounts to a major national security risk. The\nattackers also had access to other tranches of more generic\ninternet traffic, they said. Verizon Communications, AT&amp;T and\nLumen Technologies are among the companies whose networks were\nbreached by the recently discovered intrusion, the people said.</p>\n\n<p>The widespread compromise is considered a potentially catastrophic\nsecurity breach and was carried out by a sophisticated Chinese\nhacking group dubbed Salt Typhoon. It appeared to be geared toward\nintelligence collection, the people said. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The surveillance systems believed to be at issue are used to\ncooperate with requests for domestic information related to\ncriminal and national security investigations. Under federal law,\ntelecommunications and broadband companies must allow authorities\nto intercept electronic information pursuant to a court order. It\ncouldn’t be determined if systems that support foreign\nintelligence surveillance were also vulnerable in the breach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This incident should henceforth be the canonical example when arguing against “back doors for the good guys” in any networks or protocols. It’s not fair to say that all back doors will, with certainty, eventually be compromised, but the more sensitive and valuable the communications, the more likely it is that they will. And this one was incredibly sensitive and valuable. There are downsides to the inability of law enforcement to easily intercept end-to-end encrypted communication, but the potential downsides of back doors are far worse. Law enforcement is supposed to be hard work.</p>\n\n<p>We should rightfully blame China first for this attack — and the U.S. government ought to start treating such attacks by China as part of the second Cold War that they are, and retaliate in big ways — but secondary blame must go to Congress for passing the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) in 1994, and to the FCC <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/u-s-communications-hacked-the-history-of-calea-encryption-and-backdoors/\">for broadening its interpretation a decade later</a>. Verizon, AT&amp;T, and the other companies whose networks were breached were — and remain — required by law to provide the back doors that the Chinese hackers exploited.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/07/china-calea-back-door-hack\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a4d4a334c834edfb5a5e2bd6ee3ea7d35e862a0c3c74d317f9453397df3e743c","category":"Tech"}
