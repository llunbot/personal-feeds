The action will heat up on the cobblestones of the Champs-Élysées though, where the fastmen will be vying for one of the biggest prizes a sprinter can win: a stage victory on the final stage of the Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to watch for:</strong> Tadej Pogačar and his teammates sipping champagne as they slow-roll their way towards Paris, and then an intense final sprint where all eyes will be on Mark Cavendish as he attempts to surpass Eddy Merckx for the all-time record for career Tour stage wins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for:</strong> Sprinters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dane Cash’s picks:</strong><em> Cavendish is the clear favorite for the final sprint of the Tour de France. His speed and lead-out train have been the strongest combination that any sprinter has brought to bear in this Tour and that probably won’t change on Sunday. Others to watch include Jasper Philipsen, Cees Bol, Wout van Aert, Michael Matthews, and Sonny Colbrelli. Also keep an eye on André Greipel in his final sprint effort on the Champs-Élysées.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TDF21_PROFILS-ETAPES-SANS-RAVITO_ETP21.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/TDF21_ET21_carte-1340x947.jpeg\" /></figure>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/preview-what-you-need-to-know-about-stage-21-of-the-2021-tour-de-france/\">Read More</a>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"633b61de5957e010835fde5d113bbf3672da6950d6f6a62806ce36d6d7988e72","category":"Cycling"}
