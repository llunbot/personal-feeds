It’s claimed to save riders 10.1 watts over a bike length in a final sprint, compared to the more highly vented Velocis helmet.</p>\n<p>The Ballista is claimed to be 5.1 watts faster compared to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/bontrager-ballista-aero-road-helmet-officially-launched/\">previous-generation Ballista</a> aero helmet, which was released in 2015.</p>\n<p>Trek reckons this equates to a 32-second gain over the Velocis from an hour riding at 300 watts.</p>\n<p>CFD analysis was also used to model the airflow through the helmet for efficient cooling, based on the ride positions of Trek’s pro riders.</p>\n<p>The helmet incorporates <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-mips/\">MIPS Air</a> sliding-plane protection and has been rated at 5 stars for its impact protection in independent testing by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/safest-road-mtb-helmet/\">Virginia Tech.</a> This is fast becoming the recognised standard in testing helmet impact protection, with Virginia Tech publishing an annual appraisal of a wide range of helmets.</p>\n<p>Fit is adjusted with a single-lace Boa system and Trek says the helmet’s bevelled front edge provides an improved field of view when riding head-down. It reckons you can stash your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-glasses-for-cycling/\">cycling sunglasses</a> easily in the front vents, with a rubber coating helping to hold them in place.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Ballista helmet includes a trip line towards the rear to improve aerodynamics.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Trek</i></span></div>\n<p>Despite the more aero design than the Velocis, the Ballista is claimed to weigh 275 grams for a size-medium in the US (the European-spec helmet drops to 255g). Trek says this is only 15g more than the Velocis, which is its lightest helmet.</p>\n<p>At launch, it will come in four colours: black, white, white/navy and purple. Trek is not offering a pro replica colour option at launch and the purple colourway isn’t available in all territories.</p>\n<h2>New Velocis MIPS lightweight helmet</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> As with the Ballista, the Velocis is designed to improve head-down forward vision.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Trek</i></span></div>\n<p>Alongside the Ballista, Trek has launched the Velocis, which mirrors many of the features of the Ballista, but in a more open design that Trek claims weighs 260g in US spec, making it the brand’s lightest helmet.</p>\n<p>Carbon fibre reinforcement in the ribs makes for a robust structure, claims Trek.</p>\n<p>Trek says the new Velocis improves cooling by 38 per cent over its previous-generation helmet, as well as being more aero.</p>\n<p>As with the Ballista, the new Velocis uses a Boa dial adjustment system, incorporates MIPS Air and has been rated at five stars for safety by Virginia Tech.</p>\n<p>It also includes the bevelled front edge for better forward visibility when charging for the line and the rubber retainer for sunglasses in the front vents.</p>\n<p>It’s available in five colours, although not all are sold in every territory.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Carbon fibre in the helmet body helps to improve rigidity and lower weight.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Trek</i></span></div>\n<p>Both helmets are available in sizes S, M and L to fit head sizes from 51cm to 63cm and include a helmet bag. There’s a one-year crash replacement guarantee, with a free replacement if your helmet has been damaged – hang on to your receipt.</p>\n<p>While both the Ballista and Velocis use MIPS, Trek says it hasn’t abandoned the WaveCel tech found in many of its current helmets. It reckons MIPS Air is the better solution for cooling and low weight for a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-helmets/\">pro-level helmet</a> though.</p>\n<h2>Trek Ballista helmet specs</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Trek Ballista helmet in purple.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Trek</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Sizes:</strong> S (51-57cm), M (54-60cm), L (58-63cm)</li>\n<li><strong>Colours:</strong> Black, White, White/navy, Purple</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> US 275g, Europe 255g, Australia/NZ 255g</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £229.99/$299.99/€299.99</li>\n</ul><h2>Trek Velocis helmet specs</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Trek Velocis helmet in black.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Trek</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Sizes:</strong> S (51-57cm), M (54-60cm), L (58-63cm)</li>\n<li><strong>Colours:</strong> Black, White, Dark Aquatic, Red/Cobra, White/Deep Blue</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> US 260g, Europe 235g, Australia/NZ 235g (size M)</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £229.99/$299.99/€299.99</li>\n</ul>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"b199bb2e1d01f20c19b21942f51787f818d642fd2a8ef27a93239b8def8f0de7","category":"Cycling"}
