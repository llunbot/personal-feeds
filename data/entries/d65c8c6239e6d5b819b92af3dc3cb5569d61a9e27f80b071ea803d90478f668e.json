Over the course of three days in June 2021, Multnomah County—the state’s most populous county, which rests in the swayback along Oregon’s northern border—recorded highs of 108°, 112°, and 116° Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p>Temperatures were so hot that <a href=\"https://x.com/PDXStreetcar/status/1409287314870837253\" target=\"_blank\">the metal on cable cars melted</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/06/29/1011269025/photos-the-pacific-northwest-heatwave-is-melting-power-cables-and-buckling-roads\" target=\"_blank\">the asphalt on roadways buckled</a>. Nearly half the homes in the county lacked cooling systems because of Oregon’s typically gentle summers, where average highs top out at 81°.

They started researching the large fossil fuel companies whose emissions are driving the climate crisis—including ExxonMobil, Shell, and Chevron—and <a href=\"https://multco-web7-psh-files-usw2.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/First%20Amended%20Complaint.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">sued them</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035696#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035696&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d65c8c6239e6d5b819b92af3dc3cb5569d61a9e27f80b071ea803d90478f668e","category":"Tech"}
