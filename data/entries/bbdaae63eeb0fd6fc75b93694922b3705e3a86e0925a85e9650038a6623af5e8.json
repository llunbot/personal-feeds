The vehicle is undoubtedly large and will take advantage of the 23-foot-wide (7-meter) payload volume on Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket.</p>\n<p>This is the <a href=\"https://www.blueorigin.com/blue-moon/mark-1\">Mark 1 variant of the Blue Moon lander</a>. It's designed to deliver up to 3 metric tons (about 6,600 pounds) of cargo anywhere on the lunar surface. Blue Origin revealed the design on Friday.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979493#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979493&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bbdaae63eeb0fd6fc75b93694922b3705e3a86e0925a85e9650038a6623af5e8","category":"Tech"}
