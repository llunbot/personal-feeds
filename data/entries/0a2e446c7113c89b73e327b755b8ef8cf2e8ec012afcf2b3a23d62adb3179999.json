This time, it's getting <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-tablet/\">a full spec sheet</a> and a price. The Pixel Tablet is officially in iPad territory at $499, and that's <em>with</em> the fancy magnetic speaker dock included in the box. It's going up for preorder today, and will ship sometime next month.</p>\n\n<p>Since it's been a year, here is a quick recap: This is Google's first self-branded Android tablet <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/12/pixel-c-review-new-hardware-ignores-an-android-tablets-core-problem-software/\">in eight years.</a> The Pixel Tablet release follows up the company's rebooted Android tablet strategy, which started with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/tablet-focused-android-12l-update-rolls-out-just-not-to-any-tablets/\">Android 12L</a> in 2022, and has continued with <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/04/04/google-android-tablet-apps/\">pretty comprehensive</a> tablet updates to most of Google's apps.</p>\n<p>For specs, we have a 10.95-inch, 60 Hz, 2560×1600 LCD, the Google Tensor G2 SoC (same as the Pixel phones, that's an Arm X1 chip), 8GB of RAM, 128GB or 256GB of storage, and a 27 watt-hour battery. The cameras seem like an afterthought, with only an 8 MP sensor on the front and back. There's a fingerprint reader included in the power button, and while there's no official stylus, the tablet has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/google-joins-universal-stylus-group-hopes-for-cross-device-compatibility/\">USI 2.0 compatibility</a>. The body is aluminum, with a \"nano ceramic coating\" that Google says is \"inspired by porcelain.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936103#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936103&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0a2e446c7113c89b73e327b755b8ef8cf2e8ec012afcf2b3a23d62adb3179999","category":"Tech"}
