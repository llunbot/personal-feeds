It's hopefully here to stay this time.</p>\n<p>iDOS allows you to run applications made for MS-DOS via DOSBox, with a nice retro-styled interface. Its main use case is definitely playing DOS games, but it has seen a rocky road to get to this point. Initially released over a decade ago, it existed quietly for its niche audience, though it saw some changes that made it more or less useful in the developer's quest to avoid removal from the App Store after it violated Apple's rules. That culminated in it being removed altogether in 2021 after some tweets and articles brought attention to it.</p>\n<p>But earlier this year, Apple made <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/apple-now-allows-retro-game-emulators-on-its-app-store-but-with-big-caveats/\">big changes</a> to its App Store rules, officially allowing \"retro game emulators\" for the first time. That cleared the way for a wave of working console game emulators like Delta and RetroArch, which mostly work as you might expect them to on any other platform now. But when iDOS developer Chaoji Li and other purveyors of classic PC emulator software attempted to do the same for old PC games for MS-DOS and other non-console computing platforms, they <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/apple-rejects-pc-emulators-on-the-ios-app-store/\">were stymied</a>. Apple told them that it didn't consider their apps to be retro game console emulators and that they violated rules intended to prevent people from circumventing the App Store by running applications from other sources.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042868#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042868&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1e9d4202c75ffa761b132bdb0157faab09966b943f0a58a8da86d1165a4b576f","category":"Tech"}
