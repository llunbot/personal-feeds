On Thursday, Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href=\"https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1890068457825394918\">posted</a> a tease on X about the “newest member of the family” making its debut on February 19.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/x-post-cook-feb-19-tease.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=878\" alt=\"x post cook feb 19 tease\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/x-post-cook-feb-19-tease.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/x-post-cook-feb-19-tease.jpg?resize=220%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 220w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/x-post-cook-feb-19-tease.jpg?resize=768%2C1050&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/x-post-cook-feb-19-tease.jpg?resize=878%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 878w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/x-post-cook-feb-19-tease.jpg?resize=1124%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1124w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/x-post-cook-feb-19-tease.jpg?resize=1499%2C2048&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1499w\" width=\"878\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>While you can’t tell by the static image we’ve posted here, Cook’s post is actually an animation where the Apple logo looks like it has chrome flowing through it.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Tim Cook/X</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Macworld’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/david.price\">David Price</a> points out that the image looks like an AirTag, which has a polished aluminum cap with an Apple logo on it. A new AirTag isn’t completely out of the question; <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2523902/a-new-airtag-is-coming-next-year-with-enhanced-privacy-security-features.html\">last November</a>, we found out that Apple had been running “manufacturing tests” on a new AirTag, so it could be the product being referred to by Cook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or perhaps the X image can be interpreted as the Apple logo on the back of an iPhone. The iPhone SE was thought to debut this week, but Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2605710/iphone-se-4-launch-pushed-to-next-week-but-something-smaller-is-coming-today.html\">said</a> last Tuesday that it “should be announced by next week.” It’s also entirely possible Apple could release a new iPhone SE and a new AirTag, though Cook’s reference to “newest member” is in the singular (if you get pedantic about it).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another product with a polished aluminum logo: the MacBook Air. Gurman has <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575467/the-m4-macbook-air-is-set-to-kick-off-a-loaded-2025-for-the-mac.html\">reported</a> that the M4 MacBook Air will be released “relatively soon.” The new Air would arrive 11 months after the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\">M3 MacBook Air</a> was released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is also expected to unveil the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2025-release-date.html\">11th-generation iPad</a>, but there have been few reports of it in the rumor mill. The current 10th-gen iPad was released in October 2022, so its update is due.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s releases in 2025 so far have been software (and Apple TV+ shows and OS updates). On Wednesday, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2607001/apple-tv-app-android-now-available.html\">Apple TV Android app</a> was made available in the Google Play store. Last week, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2573248/apples-next-iphone-app-could-be-an-easy-way-to-manage-event-invitations.html\">Invites</a> app was released. Earlier this month, Apple released the Black Unit Collection (which includes a commemorative Apple Watch band that could be considered the first new hardware item of 2025) to celebrate Black History Month. Apple kicked off 2025 with <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/apple-fitness-plus-unveils-an-exciting-lineup-of-new-ways-to-stay-active-in-2025/\">new Fitness+ content</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about what we could see next week, check out the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/new-iphone-se-release-date-se4-16e-design-specs-features.html\">iPhone SE 4: Everything you need to know about Apple’s next budget phone</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2523902/a-new-airtag-is-coming-next-year-with-enhanced-privacy-security-features.html\">A new AirTag is coming next year with enhanced privacy, security features (Nov. 2024)</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">M4 MacBook Air: Everything you need to know</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2025-release-date.html\">11th-gen iPad: Everything you need to know about the 2025 refresh</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"650aa13d67f8592b60c7a4ab9b34f1602c533e39a53e0130a19844665de55cba","category":"Apple"}
