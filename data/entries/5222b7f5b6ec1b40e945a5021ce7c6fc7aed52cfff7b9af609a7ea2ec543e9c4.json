As the bright glare of flames illuminated her bathroom \nwindow, she was able to escape safety with her 14-year-old \ndaughter, Josie, and their dog Princess.

Sarah, a resilient single mother who has always worked \ntirelessly to provide for her family, now faces the task of \nrebuilding their lives from scratch. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A lot of people, each giving a little, can make a big difference here.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/13/help-sarah-perez\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5222b7f5b6ec1b40e945a5021ce7c6fc7aed52cfff7b9af609a7ea2ec543e9c4","category":"Tech"}
