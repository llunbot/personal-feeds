Appleâ€™s release notes state that the following bugs have been addressed in the update:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>USB hubs connected to external displays may not be recognized</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Copy-protected Audio Unit plug-ins designed for professional music apps may not open or pass validation</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Apps that include Java may quit unexpectedly</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Those listed bugs address most of the major bugs that have surfaced after the macOS 14.4 update that arrived on March 7. The only other bug not listed involves a version of a file <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2274686/macos-sonoma-14-4-icloud-drive-bug-saved-versions.html\">not saving when added to iCloud Drive</a>. However, Apple likely fixed this as well either through the update or a server-side iCloud fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the bug fixes, macOS 14.4.1 also includes <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214096&amp;xcust=1-1-2279053-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">a pair of security updates</a>. Apple declined to release details on the security updates when iOS 17.4.1 arrived last week but has now shared information about the patches, which affect CoreMedia and WebRTC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To update to macOS 14.4.1, open System Settings, then select <em>General</em>, then <em>Software Update</em>, and click <em>Update Now</em>.</p>\n\nMacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8fa9acc62a8bdcebbd59ebcf7c9d99860b03c95d8038052bcfa500f8f72046dd","category":"Apple"}
