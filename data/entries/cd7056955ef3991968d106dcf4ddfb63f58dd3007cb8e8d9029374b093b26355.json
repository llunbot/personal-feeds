For its tenth birthday the Troy not only gets a fully redesigned frame, it also gets a little brother. There will now be two models of the 5th generation Troy offered – The Troy and Troy ST (short travel).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Troys boast several updates including in-frame storage, internal cable routing, new rocker links and UDH compatibility among others. Since the new Troy has been bumped up to 150mm travel, it and the 130mm ST model sit on either side of the outgoing Troy’s 140mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been riding the new Troy for the last few weeks, so check out my <strong>review article</strong> to see how it performed on-trail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Devinci Troy and Troy ST – Frame Features:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-frame-closeup-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-frame-closeup-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy, frame closeup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-frame-closeup-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-frame-closeup-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-frame-closeup-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-frame-closeup-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-frame-closeup-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-frame-closeup-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Troy and Troy ST frames are made in Canada from Optimum G04 6061 T6 aluminum. Devinci says this aluminum provides excellent durability, stiffness and strength-to-weight ratio. The frames are hand built in Canada and covered by a lifetime warranty.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-linkage-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-linkage-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy, Split Pivot linkage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-linkage-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-linkage-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-linkage-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-linkage-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-linkage-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-linkage-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Suspension is managed by Devinci’s Split-Pivot suspension linkage, which separates braking and acceleration forces providing excellent small-bump compliance and solid pedalling efficiency. This linkage is also tuned with a progressive leverage ratio that works well with coil shocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated Troy offers 150/160mm suspension travel, both increased from the previous Troy’s 140mm rear travel and 150mm fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-flip-chip-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-flip-chip-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy, flip-chip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-flip-chip-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-flip-chip-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-flip-chip-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-flip-chip-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-flip-chip-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-flip-chip-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Formerly set up as a 29er the new Troy rolls out with MX wheels, but all frame sizes are 29” compatible via a flip-chip in the lower shock mount. If you decide to run a full 29” setup, the flip-chip offers Hi and Lo geometry settings. Flipping the chip for MX compatibility maintains the same geometry with either rear wheel size. Suspension kinematics aren’t identical with either wheel, but the differences in anti-squat, anti-rise, and leverage rate are very minor.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-angle-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-angle-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy ST, angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-angle-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-angle-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-angle-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-angle-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-angle-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-angle-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who favor a bit less squish, the Troy ST provides 130mm of rear travel and a 140mm fork. The ST is set up with 29” wheels on medium-XL frames, and 27.5” wheels on XS and small frames. The Troy ST’s flip-chip offers Hi and Lo positions for all frame sizes, plus offers MX compatibility for 27.5” wheels on the M-XL frames.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rocker-link-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rocker-link-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy, rocker link\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rocker-link-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rocker-link-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rocker-link-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rocker-link-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rocker-link-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rocker-link-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole Troy frame has been redesigned, most noticeably with less curves. The new frames feature straighter top tubes, down tubes, and seat stays, plus a smaller shock mount on the down tube. The Troys also include a redesigned rocker link that shaves weight from the outgoing version.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy, Shed frame storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-Shed-storage-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One big addition is Devinci’s “Shed” frame storage system, offering convenient in-bike storage for essential trail tools and supplies. Devinci was careful to leave plenty of space in the frames for water bottles. Even a size small will fit a 500ml bottle with a reservoir rear shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fitments/Frame Protection:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-cable-routing-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-cable-routing-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy, cable routing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-cable-routing-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-cable-routing-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-cable-routing-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-cable-routing-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-cable-routing-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-cable-routing-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated alloy frames now include internal cable routing, with nice clean straight-entry holes at the head tube. Key fitments include a SRAM UDH derailleur hanger, and a 73mm threaded BB shell with a 3-bolt ISCG mount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with the new Troys, Devinci is moving their MTBs back to 148mm Boost axle spacing from 157mm. They say with 55mm chainline spacing (compatible with SRAM’s T-Type transmissions) they can achieve the tire and chainring clearance they desire without the wider rear axle. The Troy offers clearance for 29×2.5” or 27.5×2.6” rear tires, and fits chainrings from 28-34t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for dropper posts, the Troy comes with 150mm posts on smalls, 180mm on medium, 200mm on large, and 220mm on XL. The Troy ST adds an XS frame size, which comes with a 125mm post. The frames accept 31.6mm diameter posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-chainstay-guard-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-chainstay-guard-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy, chainstay guard\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-chainstay-guard-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-chainstay-guard-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-chainstay-guard-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-chainstay-guard-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-chainstay-guard-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-chainstay-guard-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All Troy frames are built with Enduro brand double lip sealed bearings. Key linkage pivots feature double row bearings for increased durability and rigidity. To fend off damage, the Troys come with chainstay protectors and lower down tube guards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry: Troy</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-geo-chart-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"833\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-geo-chart-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy geo chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-geo-chart-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-geo-chart-297x206.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-geo-chart-120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-geo-chart-768x533.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The redesigned Troy frame features updated geometry, with a familiar recipe of slacker steering and a steeper seat angle. Out back the Troys get size specific chainstay lengths, with two lengths shared between four frame sizes. With three different geo configurations possible, I’ll leave it to you to pore through the options shown in the chart above.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry: Troy ST</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-geo-chart-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"865\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-geo-chart-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy ST geo chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-geo-chart-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-geo-chart-297x214.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-geo-chart-120x87.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-geo-chart-768x554.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As you might guess, the Troy ST’s reach numbers are a bit longer than the Troys, their head tube angles are a bit steeper, and the chainstays are a tad longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The above chart shows geometry figures for the Troy ST’s stock wheel sizes – Full 27.5” on XS/S frames, and full 29” on M-XLs. As mentioned earlier, the M-XL frames can run a 27.5” rear wheel (with the chip in Hi position), but the flip-chip maintains the same geometry as the full 29” setup in Lo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Model Lineup:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Devinci is debuting the new Troys with just one model of each… for now. More complete build options will be announced in Spring 2025. See the images below for complete build specs on the introductory GX AXS models.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Troy GX AXS 12S – $5549</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-GX-AXS-side-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-GX-AXS-side-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy GX AXS, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-GX-AXS-side-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-GX-AXS-side-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-GX-AXS-side-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-GX-AXS-side-768x432.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-GX-AXS-specs-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1211\" height=\"633\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-GX-AXS-specs-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy GX AXS, specs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-GX-AXS-specs-jpg.webp 1211w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-GX-AXS-specs-297x155.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-GX-AXS-specs-120x63.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-GX-AXS-specs-768x401.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Troy GX AXS 12S frames come in Gloss/Matcha.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Troy ST GX AXS 12S – $5299</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-GX-AXS-side-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-GX-AXS-side-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy ST GX AXS, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-GX-AXS-side-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-GX-AXS-side-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-GX-AXS-side-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-GX-AXS-side-768x432.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-GX-AXS-specs-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1211\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-GX-AXS-specs-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy ST GX AXS, specs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-GX-AXS-specs-jpg.webp 1211w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-GX-AXS-specs-297x152.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-GX-AXS-specs-120x61.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-ST-GX-AXS-specs-768x392.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ST model’s frame comes in Gloss/Stoneware Orange.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rider-dusty-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rider-dusty-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Devinci Troy, rider, dusty\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rider-dusty-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rider-dusty-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rider-dusty-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rider-dusty-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rider-dusty-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Devinci-Troy-rider-dusty-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>This photo and title photo c.
