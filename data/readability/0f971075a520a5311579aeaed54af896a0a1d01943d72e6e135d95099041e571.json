The consequence is usually more balanced spoke tension between drive side and non-drive side spokes, resulting in a dependable system for those off-grid adventures.</p><p><strong>Scope Cycling:</strong> The choice for a symmetrical or asymmetrical rim shape is not related to the underground or environment in which the wheels are used. The main reason to use an asymmetrical rim profile is to balance the tension from the drive and non-drive side spokes.&nbsp;</p><p>At Scope we use a 2:1 spoke ratio to balance the spoke tension and therefore we do not need to use an asymmetrical rim shape. A symmetrical rim shape is always preferred by us as it outperforms an asymmetrical rim in terms of aerodynamics. Therefore, we only use asymmetrical rims in the case where we can not apply a 2:1 spoke ratio and when aerodynamics does not play a significant role. For example, in case of our <a href=\"https://www.scopecycling.com/product/r2o/\">R2.O off-road</a> rear wheel which features 28 spokes.</p><figure id=\"attachment_268107\"

Therefore, it makes sense to use wider tires on an MTB and narrower tires on a Gravel bike.</p><figure id=\"attachment_267898\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-267898\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels.jpg\" alt=\"scope cycling mtb wheels leogang discuss vibration damping versus gravel wheels\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels-297x297.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels-800x800.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels-120x120.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels-768x768.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels-696x696.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels-1068x1068.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels-420x420.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels-297x297.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels-800x800.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels-120x120.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels-768x768.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels-696x696.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels-1068x1068.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11121218/Eric-Haegsted-Leogang-scope-cycling-mtb-wheels-420x420.jpg 420w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-267898\">The Scope R2.O carbon wheels can take 35mm – 37mm gravel tires or 2.1″ – 2.6″ MTB tires</figcaption></figure><p>We recommend changing the width of the tire based on the roughness of the tracks.

The only application where we have seen a need for a greater spoke count is for bike-packing, where riders are adding 100 pounds or more weight to their bikes.</p><figure id=\"attachment_268109\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-268109\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims.jpg\" alt=\"reserve 22 700c gravel wheelset\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13094847/reserve-22-700c-gravel-wheels-carbon-rims-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-268109\">Reserve Wheels feature a reinforced rim bed around each of the 24 spoke holes</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Fulcrum Wheels:</strong> That could be a valid question or query for built/assembled wheel systems; where you’re picking a rim, then a hub, then spokes and trying to make all the parts fit. However, we make complete wheels under the idea of the “all for one”. That’s not just a slogan but, most importantly, a product design philosophy and working method.
