Originally coinciding with the men’s three-week race, the race organisers decided that the women’s race should be a proper tour of its own with a whole week of racing, and it’s now held in May, three months before the men’s race in August/September. With the expanded format, the race naturally transformed from one dominated by sprinters like Jolien D'hoore to one won by stage racing specialists like Annemiek van Vleuten and Demi Vollering. </span></p>\n<p><span>After the former’s retirement at the end of the 2023 season, the latter has very much taken up the mantle as the preeminent stage racer in the peloton and as the defending champion, she comes into the race as the standout favourite. However, she won’t have it all her own way, as the race is regarded as one of the most important races in the Women’s WorldTour calendar it attracts the world’s best riders to the start line, all looking to take glory on the Spanish roads and claim the leader’s red jersey — </span><em>el maillot rojo.</em><b></b></p>\n<h3><span>La Vuelta a España Femenina Route 2025</span></h3>\n<p>La Vuelta a España Femenina format has gone through several iterations in its short history, from the one-day flat race from 2015 to 2017 to a two-day race, which included an individual time trial and a flat stage into Madrid. However, it wasn’t until 2021 when the race really began to come into its own, with a unique identity, moving away from Madrid and into the mountains of northern Spain for a four-day race. This format has been expanded on in recent years, and with it, the Grand Tour has established its own prestige in the WorldTour calendar.</p>\n<p>This year promises to be another intriguing edition with an exciting mixture of flat, lumpy, and mountainous stages across northern Spain, kicking off with a team time trial in Barcelona on Sunday, May 4 and finishing atop the 10km at 8% Alto de Cotobello in Asturias on Saturday, May 10. Between Catalunya and Asturias, there are five stages passing through the Aragon, La Rioja and Castile y León regions.&amp;nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Barcelona team time trial will be the first opportunity for the strongest squads to show their collective power and expertise on the 8.1km flat course, which is not particularly technical. The time gaps shouldn’t be too big, but if a team leader were to have any difficulties like a mechanical issue, they could lose time. Stage two from Molins de Rei to Sant Boi de Llobregat is also held in Catalunya, and although it features a couple of small climbs, it will likely end in a bunch sprint.&amp;nbsp;</p>\n<p>The race then heads inland on stage three for a lumpy route between Barbastro and Huesca, which although doesn’t have any categorised climbs, could be a hard day in what can be an exposed and hot area even this early in the summer. Stage four is the first introduction of some more serious climbing, with the route taking on two categorised climbs in the Moncayo area, the last of which — the Puerto de El Buste (4.5km at 5.6%) — comes with 20km to go, but its likely the GC contenders will save their bullets for what it to come in the following days.&amp;nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stage five is the first of two summit finishes atop the savage 6.5km 9.1% Category one climb to Lagunas de Neila in the Sierra de la Demanda mountain range. We can expect some decisive moves on the GC on this final climb, which is also preceded by the challenging Alto de Rozavientos (3.8km at 7.6%). Stage six may not be a mountainous day, but the route between Becerril de Campos and Baltanás is far from flat and with a number of short lumps coming into the finish, a lot of teams will be nervous about missing any potential splits.</p>\n<p>The final day is in the Asturias region which is notorious for its hard climbs. Indeed, the final act of the Vuelta will be played out on the Alto de Cotobello (10km at 8%) where the overall leader of el maillot rojo will be decided.&amp;nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/feed5.png?v=1746110661\" /></p>\n<p><em>La Vuelta a España Femenina Route 2025 (Map: La Vuelta by Carrefour.es)</em></p>\n<h3><span>Contenders</span></h3>\n<h4><span>Demi Vollering</span></h4>\n<p><span>The defending champion Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) is the favourite to claim the </span><span>maillot rojo, </span><span>but she has not been as dominant so far in 2025 compared to previous years.

To do so, she will have the backing of a strong team, including her reliable lieutenant </span><strong>Juliette Labous</strong><span> and Vuelta stage winner from last year, </span><strong>Évita Muzic</strong><span>, who beat her current team leader when Vollering was riding for her former team SD-Worx.</span><b></b></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Évita Muzic beating Demi Vollering on stage six of the Vuelta Femenina 2024 (Image: ASO)\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Untitled_design_-_2025-05-01T161353.483_1024x1024.png?v=1746112444\" /></div>\n<p><span> <em>Évita Muzic beating Demi Vollering on stage six of the Vuelta Femenina 2024 (Image: ASO)</em></span></p>\n<h4><span>Kasia Niewiadoma</span></h4>\n<p><span>Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon//SRAM zondacrypto) memorably beat Vollering at last year’s </span><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-femmes-preview?srsltid=AfmBOootDf-TyRpndyHaitINAlneGdWUYdRgFv0oS31l0cGq4kyzweli\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Tour de France Femmes</span></a><span> to claim the biggest win of her career, but like Vollering she has had somewhat of a frustrating Classics campaign.

However, Niewiadoma was up there in a number of races, and as the season moves to a different style of racing, this consistency will be rewarded more in the upcoming stage races than in the one-day Classics. </span><b></b></p>\n<p><span>This consistency and dogged determination are what brought her glory on the roads of France last July, but can she repeat the feat south of the Pyrenees at La Vuelta? </span></p>\n<p><span>Since the race expanded its format in 2021, Niewiadoma has been solid without being remarkable at the Spanish race, finishing sixth in 2021, 10th in 2022 and 2023 before dropping out last year.

However, with plenty of opportunities for team tactics to have a big effect on the racing, the squad could work well together to try and expose and isolate the other contenders. They will also be hoping that they can put together a strong team time trial on stage one to set the tone for their home race. Lippert, who was fifth in Valencia, has been climbing well this season, resulting in third at the Tour of Flanders and fifth at La Flèche Wallonne. If she can translate these short efforts on the Flandrian and Ardennes climbs into the longer efforts up the Spanish mountains, she has a real chance of a high GC finish.</span><b></b></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Liane Lippert at Liège-Bastogne-Liège 2025 (Image: Thomas Maheux / ASO)\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20250427LBF0048_1024x1024.jpg?v=1746113662\" /></div>\n<p><span></span><em>Liane Lippert at Liège-Bastogne-Liège 2025 (Image: Thomas Maheux / ASO)</em></p>\n<h4><span>Other contenders</span></h4>\n<p><span>The home favourite for the Spanish Grand Tour is </span><span><strong>Mavi García</strong> </span><span>(Liv Alula Jayco), who, like Niewiadoma, is a constant presence on tough mountain days.
