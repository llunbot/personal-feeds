While this might sound like a risky option, it doesn’t have to be. Specialist retailers offer warranties and check devices before reselling them. We’ll help you find a reputable source for second-hand iPhones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that Apple has launched the iPhone 16 series, you can get excellent deals on older phones including the 15-, 14-, and maybe even the 13- series. (Apple still sells the standard iPhone 15 models, but has discontinued the 15 Pro and Pro Max, which means refurbished is the way to go with those models.) The older iPhone you’re prepared to buy, the bigger the savings you can enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we cover everything there is to know about safely buying a refurbished iPhone, whether you’re looking to buy SIM-free or on contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Refurbished iPhone deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can save money buying the iPhone 15 from Apple’s refurbished store and from resellers such as BackMarket or Amazon Renewed. We have details of all the best resellers of refurbished iPhones below. Just be aware that the resellers can get a bit creative with the original pricing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Refurbished iPhone 15 deals U.S.</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple refurbished store: <a

your chosen handset: check to see if the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/iphone\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Refurbished Store</a> has the iPhone model you’re looking for. (That’s the U.S. store. British readers should try the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/iphone\" target=\"_blank\">U.K. Apple Refurbished Store</a>.) At time of writing Apple is selling refurbished models of the iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s refurbished store tends to be the most expensive place to buy refurbished iPhones–although it’s still significantly cheaper than buying new. (The standard reduction on the Apple Refurbished Store is 15 percent.) But there are advantages that come with this higher price. The refurb phones all come with the same one-year limited warranty that you’ll find on the brand-new versions, for example. And it’s worth noting that any parts used in the refurb will be official Apple ones, and all devices come with brand-new batteries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth shopping around, however, to make sure you’re getting a good deal. There are plenty of other companies that make a living from refurbishing and selling iPhones. Here are some of the more prominent resellers of refurbished and used iPhones:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Refurbished iPhone sellers in the U.S.</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.backmarket.com/search?q=iPhone&amp;ga_search=iPhone\" target=\"_blank\">Back Market</a>: You get 30 days to change your mind and a 12-month warranty… or occasionally more.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.decluttr.com/us/store/\" target=\"_blank\">Decluttr</a>: A popular destination for refurbished devices, often with sales that slash even more money off.

You’ll find older iPhone models in the online stores of many networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices change all the time, so we’d recommend reading our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672801/best-iphone-deals.html\">Best iPhone deals</a> guide on a regular basis to see which offers are currently available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should I buy a refurbished iPhone? What is refurbished?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be concerned about buying a refurbished handset, thinking that it would be like buying a second-hand iPhone, but there’s no reason to be worried. Remember: refurbished and second-hard aren’t the same thing. Refurbished iPhones are pre-owned but are wiped, tested, and repaired to work like new. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhones Apple sells in the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/iphone\" target=\"_blank\">Refurbished Store</a> were returned to Apple for a variety of reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The previous owner could have exercised their consumer rights and returned the handset unused within 14 days (as per Apple’s refund and exchange policy).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The iPhone may have been used as a demonstration model.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The iPhone may have been returned to Apple due to a fault.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The third point on that list may concern you, but you can be sure that Apple will have identified and fixed any faults before reselling the device. The company says refurbished products undergo “full functional testing” and are provided with “genuine Apple part replacements (if necessary).” They also get “a thorough cleaning,” incidentally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of benefits to buying a refurbished iPhone:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You get a one-year warranty.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You get <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/about\" target=\"_blank\">90 days of tech support</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Because you’re buying from Apple directly, there are no shipping costs and free returns.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can also take advantage of Apple’s 14-day returns policy if you change your mind. (Note however that Apple isn’t the only seller to offer such a policy.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Refurbished vs second-hand: What’s the difference?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If it’s not already clear, a refurbished iPhone is tested and repaired so the handset works like new (or as close to new as possible). A second-hand iPhone, on the other hand, is simply sold as is, which means the device may not last as long, and may have small imperfections or defects. The battery in particular will be a worry in the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other risks to buying second-hand too. If the previous owner hasn’t dissociated their Apple ID from the device you may get permanently locked out of the iPhone. Unfortunately, Apple’s customer service wouldn’t be able to help you unlock the phone either, as the company has strict security policies. Such a situation would be less of a concern if you know and can easily contact the previous owner (and they remember their Apple ID details), but we’d prefer avoiding such complications to start with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just another reason why buying refurbished is a more reliable route to go if you did want to pick up a previously owned iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does refurbished Grade A mean?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you shop refurbished you might see grade scores such as A, B, or C; this indicates the condition of the phone. Is it dinged up? Does it have scratches? Or is it completely blemish-free and pristine? The grade gives you a general idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We say “general” because these grades aren’t set by an independent body, which means they can vary from retailer to retailer. This is how the grades usually break down:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Grade A: Looks like new or has very few signs of wear</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Grade B: Might have some minor scratches and some wear</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Grade C: Looks used and has obvious signs of wear</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But some sites go with Fair, Good, and Excellent or some other variation. (One site we’ve visited appears to grade everything as A plus a number–so a comparatively poor handset would be rated as A3. This may strike some readers as a little confusing.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, Grade A/A1/Excellent refurbished devices will be more expensive than Grade C, but you’ll still be paying far less than you would for a brand-new device. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pay attention to refurbished warranties </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that the quality of refurbished iPhone devices can vary from retailer to retailer, it’s important to pay attention to the warranty. How long is the phone covered? The warranty allows you to get help or free repairs from the seller if you run into any issues after purchase. Retailers typically offer a year, and many allow “quibble-free” returns if you change your mind within 14 days. Check the fine print.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More refurbished Apple guides</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673879/should-i-buy-a-refurbished-apple-watch.html\">Should I buy a refurbished Apple Watch?</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673929/why-you-should-buy-a-refurbished-mac.html\">Why you should buy a refurbished Mac</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670633/where-buy-refurbished-ipad.html\">Should I buy a refurbished iPad &amp; best deals</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670463/buy-apple-refurbished.html\">Where to buy a refurbished MacBook or Mac</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"343467b13146ccc2e762887a0562ec9828be504526b9b4cbc32b9eb36df26be6","category":"Apple"}
