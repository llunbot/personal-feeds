The European Space Agency launched a follow-up mission Monday to go back to the crash site and see the damage done.</p>\n<p>The nearly $400 million (363 million euro) Hera mission, named for the Greek goddess of marriage, will investigate the aftermath of a cosmic collision between NASA's DART spacecraft and the skyscraper-size asteroid Dimorphos on September 26, 2022. NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission was the first planetary defense experiment, and it worked, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/dart-mission-successfully-shifted-its-targets-orbit/\">successfully nudging Dimorphos off its regular orbit</a> around a larger companion asteroid named Didymos.</p>\n<p>But NASA had to sacrifice the DART spacecraft in the deflection experiment. Its destruction meant there were no detailed images of the condition of the target asteroid after the impact.
