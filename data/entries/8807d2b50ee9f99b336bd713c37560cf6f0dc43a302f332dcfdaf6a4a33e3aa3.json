As we do, we thought we'd share some initial impressions after having Nintendo's new console in hand for 48 hours or so. Consider these first thoughts an extended version of our notes from a review in progress and a starting point for discussion of the first completely new Nintendo platform in over eight years.</p>\n<h2>The Switch 2 Joy-Cons feel great</h2>\n<p>There's something incredibly satisfying about the magnetic \"snap\" when you plug the new Joy-Cons into the Switch 2 horizontally, and the handy release lever makes it much easier to disconnect the controllers from the tablet with one hand. Even without a physical rail holding the Joy-Cons to the system (as on the Switch), the magnetic connection feels remarkably sturdy in portable mode.</p>\n<img width=\"3024\" height=\"4032\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/switch2-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/switch2-2.jpg 3024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/switch2-2-640x853.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/switch2-2-1024x1365.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/switch2-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/switch2-2-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/switch2-2-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/switch2-2-980x1307.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/switch2-2-1440x1920.jpg 1440w\" />\n      The Switch 2 Joy-Con (left) and a right-side original Switch Joy-Con.\n    \n<p>Though the Switch 2's expanded Joy-Cons generally feel more comfortable for adult hands, I have noticed that the analog stick encroaches a little more on the space for the face buttons on the right Joy-Con.
