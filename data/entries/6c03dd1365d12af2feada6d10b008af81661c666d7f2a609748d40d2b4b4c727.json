That typically has a central seam on top which is taped to keep out wheel spray. Other seams will usually be taped too.</span></p>\n<p><span>The classic material for overshoes is closed-cell neoprene rubber. It’s the same stuff used for wetsuits and provides wet weather protection while adding insulation. Unfortunately, it’s not that durable, so it’s often covered with a tougher outer fabric. At 3mm or so thick, it has quite a bulky look too, and it’s not at all breathable. </span></p>\n<p><span>Sometimes kit makers will use a less bulky fabric for the uppers, one that’s typically DWR (durable water repellent) coated to repel water, and includes a breathable membrane. It’s an alternative to neoprene that’s lighter and less stiff, but it can lose its water-resistance over time and, unless additional insulation is added, may not be as warm in cold weather. </span></p>\n<p><span>Whether that matters, of course, depends on when you’re planning to use your overshoes. It doesn’t only rain in winter, of course…</span></p>\n<h3>Overshoe sole design</h3>\n<p><span>The Achilles’ heel of overshoes tends to be their sole. First, it needs to have a couple of holes in it to fit over your shoes’ cleats and heel. This inevitably lets water in, which can creep into your shoes’ uppers and through vent holes in their soles.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also, you’re going to end up walking in your overshoes at some point, and you’ll have to put a foot down at junctions or stops, all of which subjects them to wear.</span></p>\n<p><span> Most overshoes use a much tougher fabric on the base, sometimes including kevlar fibres, to cope with the abuse. Even so, you’re likely to find that your overshoes wear quite quickly and need replacing after a couple of winters riding.</span></p>\n<p><span>With that in mind, cheap but functional might be better than technical and flashy if you’re budget-conscious.</span></p>\n<h3>Do you actually need overshoes?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Proper winter cycling shoes are a great option but are probably only of interest if you’re a dedicated winter rider.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>An alternative to overshoes is to buy a pair of dedicated winter cycling shoes. They’ll have sealed soles, so water ingress from below is avoided and the upper is usually insulated, waterproof and breathable, so your feet shouldn’t get cold, wet or sweaty. </span></p>\n<p><span>With some winter-specific shoes, heel lift can be an issue because the ankle cuff needs to be wide enough to allow you to insert your foot into the boot. </span></p>\n<p><span>In the last couple of years, brands such as Mavic, Fizik and Northwave have brought out winter cycling shoes. These too have a waterproof upper and sole, and include insulation, but without a cuff the fit around the ankle is closer, leading to better pedalling dynamics and a more comfortable fit. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you’re planning to ride extensively in cold, wet conditions, a dedicated set of winter shoes or boots may work out cheaper than hammering your summer shoes and replacing overshoes regularly. </span><span>Waterproof socks are a boon for the winter rider too.</span></p>\n<h2>Have you found what you’re looking for?</h2>\n<p>If you’re looking to buy more winter kit, make sure you check out our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-winter-cycling-gloves/\">best winter gloves</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-cycling-kit-for-riding-in-the-rain/\">best cycling kit for riding in the rain</a>.</p>\n<p>And, if you’re keeping it indoors, here’s everything you need to know about <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/beginners-guide-to-indoor-training-all-you-need-to-get-started/\">indoor cycling</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-indoor-cycling-apps/\">training apps</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\">best smart trainers</a>.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"6c03dd1365d12af2feada6d10b008af81661c666d7f2a609748d40d2b4b4c727","category":"Cycling"}
