Kuo said smart home capabilities would be a core aspect of the device, which aligns with the home hub rumors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-home-command-center-march-2025/\">previously reported</a> that the hub can be attached to a tabletop base with a speaker, or mounted on a wall. He said the device will run a new \"homeOS\" operating system with a customizable widget-focused home screen, and revolve around Siri, Apple Intelligence, and HomeKit. The hub could double as a home security system by displaying camera footage, and a built-in camera would allow for FaceTime video calls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's hub would compete with products like Google's Nest Hub and Amazon's Echo Show. It is unclear if Apple will actually use HomePod branding for the device, or if it will opt for an all-new name, such as the Apple Home.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo and Gurman both said Apple is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-smart-home-camera-rumor/\">planning an indoor camera</a> that would work with the hub.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear if the current full-size HomePod speaker will be updated this year, but a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/\">new HomePod mini is expected to launch later this year</a>. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">Apple Command Center</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/26/homepod-hub-with-7-inch-screen-rumor/\">New 'HomePod' Hub With 7-Inch Screen on Track to Launch This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-homepod-hub-with-7-inch-screen-on-track-to-launch-this-year.2448147/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bb51199a2e04aac3e255f9ba6b32d3ca4d7785dd77972e70f0f6d61f1554a638","category":"Apple"}
