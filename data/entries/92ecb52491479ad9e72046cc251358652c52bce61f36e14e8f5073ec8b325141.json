Are you looking for the best of the best tips on how to smash that upcoming gravel race, how to tackle best the multitude of surfaces you’re planning to suffer over, what minuscule details you need to consider for the best gravel set up or what exact tread pattern you should use for said gravel event?</p>\n<p>If the answer is yes to any of these questions, then I best advise you to head elsewhere. Trust me you’ll only be sorely disappointed, maybe frustrated that you’ve wasted 10 minutes of your day not having these questions answered, or even angry that you pressed play on a video that you think should be called out for being click-bait.</p>\n<p><strong>Also read:</strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/03/road-vs-gravel-what-pedal-to-use-and-why/\" target=\"_blank\">Road vs gravel: What pedal to use and why</a></p>\n<p>If you don’t want any of the above questions answered but have 10 minutes to spare to have a heap of wisdom thrown your way, then please let me introduce you to a gentleman I’m sure you’re familiar with. A certain Mr. <a href=\"http://cyclingtips.com/tag/Kiel-Reijnen\" target=\"_blank\">Kiel Reijnen</a>.</p>\n<p>Kiel is a man, a man with a fine head of hair and one who can lay claim to parading that hair around the globe for many years; Kiel, if you don’t know (but I’m sure you do), was a pro roadie. So much so that Trek-Segafredo happily employed him. That is all behind him now, a distant-ish memory.</p>\n<p>Now, Kiel and his haircut roll through life while taking on the best gravel races possible, not as a privateer, though, as he rightly hates that word. Instead, as a bloke-who-rides-gravel-races-but-not-in-a-team, yes, it’s not as catchy as “privateer”, but it’s also not as pretentious.</p>\n<p>OK. So what is here to share? Well. It’s not his top tips on how to turn pro. Instead, he’s going to help you if you heed these tips on how to be just fantastic or as fantastic as you want to be on a gravel bike, from what to carry if you come in contact with a particular member of the Friends cast, why you should have a fish at hand in the wilds AT ALL TIMES, to even why socks at this stage in Kiel’s career aren’t necessarily a good thing. And believe it or not, there are even more valuable tips. I know, crazy!</p>\n<p>OK, that’s enough teasing; press play. Trust me; you’ll enjoy it.</p>\n<div></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","author":"Troy Templin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"92ecb52491479ad9e72046cc251358652c52bce61f36e14e8f5073ec8b325141","category":"Cycling"}
