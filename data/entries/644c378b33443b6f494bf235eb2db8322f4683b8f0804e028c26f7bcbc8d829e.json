{"title":"Wiki-Style Links Between Notes in Apple Notes in iOS 17 and MacOS 14","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/apple-notes-create-links-between-notes/","date":1686696768000,"content":"\n<p>Tim Hardwick, writing for MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With just a few taps, you can create links between notes, making\nit easy to jump from one idea to another. Long press on a space in\nany note, and a new “Add Link” option can be found in the pop-up\nmenu. Tapping it lets you link to another note by searching its\ntitle or entering a URL.</p>\n\n<p>You can create an optional alternative title for the link, or just\nstick with the original title for clarity. Once you’re done, the\nlink appears as hyperlink-style underlined text in your note, and\ntapping it snaps you straight into the note you linked to.</p>\n\n<p>The Notes app also offers an additional, quicker way to add links:\nTyping two greater-than symbols (&gt;&gt;) into a note invokes a list\ncontaining your six most recently modified notes, and tapping one\ninstantly adds a link to that note.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This feature doesn’t just work for links between notes — you can add URLs of any sort, like the Edit → Add Link command in Mac apps. And the “&gt;&gt;” shortcut is pretty clever.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/13/wiki-style-links-apple-notes\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"644c378b33443b6f494bf235eb2db8322f4683b8f0804e028c26f7bcbc8d829e","category":"Tech"}
