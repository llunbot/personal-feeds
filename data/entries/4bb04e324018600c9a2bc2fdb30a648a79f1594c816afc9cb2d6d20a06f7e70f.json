The iconic desktop computer is a great combination of price and performance. Even with that, every Mac has a release cycle, and you should ask yourself if this is a good time to buy now or wait until a new version is released. Here’s what we know about the 27-inch iMac and our buying advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>27-inch iMac: Pricing and specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Released: August 2020</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 27-inch iMac is one of three Intel Macs left in Apple’s lineup. This model is over a year old, and is built to be a Mac for users who are more demanding than the typical consumer. It’s meant for people who often use high-end creative apps, software development, and other jobs that are processor intensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 27-inch iMac sports the older body and design that has since been replaced with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347534/24-inch-imac-review-apple-design-display-colors-storage-upgradability-price.html\">24-inch iMac</a>. It has a silver aluminum body that is thick at its center but tapers towards the edges. Its bezels are a lot thicker than those on the 24-inch iMac, and it has a 5K Retina display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple offers three standard configurations, priced at $1,799, $1,999, and $2,299. They come with Intel 10th-generation Core i9 processors, which can be replaced with faster Intel CPUs at an extra cost. For complete specifications, check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230127/imac-m1-features-colors-ram-storage-specs-display-price.html\">iMac FAQ</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>27-inch iMac: Why you should buy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the 24-inch iMac’s M1 processor outperforms the standard configuration of the 27-inch iMac’s Intel CPU in many tasks, you get far more options with the 27-inch iMac. Apple offers a 3.6GHz 10-core 10th-generation Intel Core i9 processor, as well as 129GB of RAM (the 24-inch maxes out at 16GB) and the option for a Radeon Pro 5700 XT with 16GB of GDDR6 memory. Of course, these things cost extra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use software than relies heavily on the GPU, the 27-inch iMac with a high-end graphics card is a better fit. Choose a 27-inch iMac and customize it with a higher-end graphics card, and you can get better graphics performance than the 24-inch iMac. You also get more ports, including four USB-A ports and, of course, a bigger screen.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>27-inch iMac (2020)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41CE+D6IxKL.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,699 | $1,899 | $2,099\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop/buy-mac/imac-imac/27-inch&amp;subid1=1-1-549791-5-198226-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$1699 at Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>27-inch iMac: Why you should wait</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The current Intel 27-inch iMac isn’t actually that old, but the initial design was introduced in a 24-inch model in 2007 (in 2012 the body became thinner), so its design is ancient. You only need to look at the 24-inch iMac to see how stale the 27-inch model is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s the recently released new Apple processors, the M1 Pro and the M1 Max that debuted in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/546363/14-inch-macbook-pro-m1-pro-review.html\">14-</a> and 16-inch MacBook Pros. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/2022-imac-pro-32-inch-design-processor-display-ports-price-release.html\">Rumor</a> has it that the new 27-inch iMac will have these processors, as well as a new Liquid Retina XDR display and a new design. Essentially, the upcoming 27-inch iMac will take the pro-level offerings of the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro and puts it in a desktop computer. It’s going to make the Intel 27-inch iMac look even more dated than it already is.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Macworld recommends: WAIT</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The current 27-inch iMac is going to be replaced—it’s just a matter of time. The new 27-inch iMac is going to be an all-in-one for users who want the highest specs in a desktop Mac. If you buy an Intel-based iMac now, you’ll regret it when you see the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/546363/14-inch-macbook-pro-m1-pro-review.html\">benchmarks for the M1 Pro and M1 Mac models</a> that replace it. And then on top of that, you’ll miss out on the new design and possibly a great new display with better image quality and smaller bezels. Hold out for just a little while longer. It’ll be worth it.</p>\n</div>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4bb04e324018600c9a2bc2fdb30a648a79f1594c816afc9cb2d6d20a06f7e70f","category":"Apple"}
