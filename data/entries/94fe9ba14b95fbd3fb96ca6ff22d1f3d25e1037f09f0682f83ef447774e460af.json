The new indicator seems to have started appearing after users updated to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-releases-ios-18-1-1-and-ipados-18-1-1/\">iOS 18.1.1</a>, but that could be just coincidence.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/at-t-turbo-indicator-iphone-16-pro-max-v0-8hrh7w5f3w1e1.jpg.jpeg\" width=\"1320\" height=\"921\" /><div><em>Image credit: Reddit user <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ATT/comments/1gv20qt/att_turbo_indicator_iphone_16_pro_max/\">No_Highlight7476</a></em></div>\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.att.com/plans/att-turbo/\">Turbo feature</a> provides enhanced network performance through prioritized data access, offering improved speeds and lower latency for activities like gaming and video streaming. Previously, customers had limited ways to confirm the service was enabled beyond checking technical network settings. With the new label, Turbo subscribers can easily verify when the $7 monthly add-on is active on their line.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome users have said they aren't too happy about the longer carrier text in their iPhone's status bar, but others don't mind it since it gives them a clear visual indicator of their premium network status. AT&amp;T says that the icon can appear sometimes when Turbo is inactive, such as when connected to Wi-Fi or when a customer's hotspot allotment is exceeded.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/att/\">AT&amp;T</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/20/att-turbo-iphone-carrier-label-ios-update/\">AT&amp;T Turbo Indicator Showing Up in iPhone Status Bar for Subscribers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/at-t-turbo-indicator-showing-up-in-iphone-status-bar-for-subscribers.2443520/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"94fe9ba14b95fbd3fb96ca6ff22d1f3d25e1037f09f0682f83ef447774e460af","category":"Apple"}
