It could also pave the way for an always-on display, so long as the refresh rate can ramp down to as low as 1Hz. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Upgraded Front Camera</h2>\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 17 models are expected to have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-more/\">24-megapixel front camera</a>, up from 12 megapixels on all iPhone 16 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith a higher 24-megapixel resolution, photos can maintain their quality even when cropped to a greater degree, providing more flexibility in post-processing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo said the upgraded camera will \"significantly improve\" image quality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple-Designed Wi-Fi 7 Chip</h2>\r<br />\nApple's first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/iphone-17-series-apple-wifi-7-chip/\">custom-designed Wi-Fi chip</a> is expected to debut in all iPhone 17 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe chip is expected to support Wi-Fi 7, which allows for data transmission over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously, with a supported router. Benefits include faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe entire iPhone 16 lineup already supports Wi-Fi 7, so the spec is not much of a surprise, but the fact that the chip will be designed by Apple is notable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>A19 Chip</h2>\r<br />\nThe A19 chip in the regular iPhone 17 is expected to be made <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/a19-and-a19-pro-n3p-rumor/\">with TSMC's newer third-generation 3nm process</a>, which is known as \"N3P.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nExpect year-over-year performance and power efficiency gains as usual.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/base-iphone-17-rumors/\">Here's What's Rumored for the Regular iPhone 17 This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-whats-rumored-for-the-regular-iphone-17-this-year.2453416/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d2a5911f50f32cf55f939cddf53eeb2a8e4af66680ce8a9acf9fd8c1ec9d5883","category":"Apple"}
