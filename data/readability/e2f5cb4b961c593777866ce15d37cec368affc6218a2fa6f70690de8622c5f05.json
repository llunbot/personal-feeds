Cooke, a brawny former athlete, is on team ‘Brains’. </p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Three episodes in, that seems a safer place to be. Team Brawn struggled at the universal survival basic of ‘making fire’, and fielded a contestant that didn’t even pack a jacket. </p><p>Meanwhile, an Instagram crochet identity is the only member of Team Brains to be sent packing thus far. Team Brains may have fire, but that’s not the only thing raging: in episode two, Cooke butted heads with teammate George, labelling him both “delusional” and “the fifth-strongest guy”.</p><p>He also tussled with Australian Football League legend Gavin Wanganeen (Team Brawn, voted out in a brutal tribal council, RIP).</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Cooke, 42, had a 13-year pro career, most prominently as a rider for Française des Jeux in the early 2000s.</p><p>In 2003 he won a stage of the <a href=\"http://www.cyclingtips.com/tag/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a>.
