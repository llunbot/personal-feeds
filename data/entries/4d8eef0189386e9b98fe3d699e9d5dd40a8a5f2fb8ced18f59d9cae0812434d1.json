It will also connect into the existing Mount Hough trail system in Quincy, as part of the larger Connected Communities project, which aims to link 15 mountain towns with a shared trail network, using outdoor recreation as an economic driver. The IVL project is a big part of the recovery for this region in northern California, much of which is still rebuilding following the devastating 2021 Dixie Fire. Planning for the Indian Valley Loop project was jumpstarted through a $50,000 grant from the Friesen Foundation. <a href=\"https://sierratrails.org/sierra-buttes-trail-stewardship-wins-50000-friesen-foundation-grant-for-the-indian-valley-loop/\" target=\"_blank\">Read more at SBTS</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/indian-valley-loop-project-update/\">VIDEO: SBTS Connected Communities – Indian Valley Loop Project Update</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"4d8eef0189386e9b98fe3d699e9d5dd40a8a5f2fb8ced18f59d9cae0812434d1","category":"Cycling"}
