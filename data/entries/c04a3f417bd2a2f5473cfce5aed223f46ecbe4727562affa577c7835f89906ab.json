You can <a href=\"https://fedora-asahi-remix.org/\">try it out now</a>, but you should \"expect rough spots (or even complete breakage).\"</p>\n<p>The new distro will be \"upstream-first,\" sending as many of its bespoke M-series tools back to Fedora's mainline offerings as possible. Hector Martin, writing on Asahi Linux's blog, notes that the existing project based on Arch Linux was \"fully downstream.\" Asahi added its own package repository with scripts, forked kernel and Mesa packages, bootloader parts, and userspace support, but with \"no significant involvement with upstream Arch Linux ARM or Arch Linux.\" Neal Gompa from Fedora reached out to talk about integrating Asahi with Fedora after the project's debut, and work began in late 2021. Now it's ready to spread a bit further.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958836#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958836&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c04a3f417bd2a2f5473cfce5aed223f46ecbe4727562affa577c7835f89906ab","category":"Tech"}
