November's patch is more notable than usual, thanks to some Pixel 6-specific bugfixes and the cutoff of the three-year-old Pixel 3 hardware.</p>\n<p>This release also marks the death of the Pixel 3 in Google's support lineup. The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/pixel-3-xl-review-great-software-but-google-just-isnt-a-hardware-leader/\">Pixel 3</a> launched in October 2018 with one of the biggest display notches ever and a serious dearth of RAM, earning it a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/pixel-3-xl-review-great-software-but-google-just-isnt-a-hardware-leader/\">lukewarm reception</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/google-admits-pixel-3-sales-have-fallen-year-over-year/\">disappointing sales</a>. While the phone survived long enough to get the big <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/google-ships-android-12-for-the-pixel-3-and-up/\">Android 12 update</a> and the October 2021 security patch, October marked three years of updates, so the November security update won't be arriving on the Pixel 3.</p>\n<p>The Pixel 3 hardware is still perfectly functional, as its Snapdragon 845 and 4GB of RAM are not far from a brand-new <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/motorola-shovels-the-2021-moto-g-lineup-onto-the-market/\">$300 phone</a>. Google <em>could</em> treat its customers better and reduce the amount of e-waste it puts into the world by extending its support timelines, but it has been reluctant to do that. Even the new Pixel 6, over which Google has end-to-end control, will still be obsolete after three years, though it will continue to get security updates. We're only asking that Google's $900 flagship match the support window of a $400 budget iPhone.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809534#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809534&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"26311f86ea6d5b5e8ec1b39fdb0cc536b20b744136598dcd500522b4979ef33b","category":"Tech"}
