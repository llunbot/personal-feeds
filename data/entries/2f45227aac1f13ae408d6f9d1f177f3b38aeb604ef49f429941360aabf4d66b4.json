Once a staple of streaming services, you can’t easily “try before you buy” with Netflix, Disney+, Max (née HBO Max), or many others. At least in the U.K., the same is now true of Apple TV+. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2050423-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-plus/?itscg=10000&amp;itsct=atv-0-apl_hp-pmo_lrn-apl-avl-210916\">U.S. site</a> lists a “Free 7-day trial” in its pricing information, the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2050423-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-tv-plus/\">U.K. site</a> now says “No commitments,” simply indicating that you can cancel your subscription at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple didn’t exactly announce the news, it simply changed its U.K. website, scrubbing all mention of the 7-day free trial. The change doesn’t show in other regions yet, so we don’t know if the U.K. is just first, or will be an outlier.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/apple-tv-plus-us-uk-compared.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple TV+ pricing\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/apple-tv-plus-us-uk-compared.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1255w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/apple-tv-plus-us-uk-compared.jpg?resize=300%2C270&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/apple-tv-plus-us-uk-compared.jpg?resize=768%2C692&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/apple-tv-plus-us-uk-compared.jpg?resize=1200%2C1080&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1080\" /><figcaption>Apple has changed the U.K. site to read “no commitments” where the 7-day free trial used to be.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are still other ways to try Apple TV+ free in the U.K. The Apple One subscription has a free trial and includes TV+, and you can get six months free as a Sky TV subscriber or three months by purchasing certain Apple hardware.
