Well, now I have all the racey details for you here. Haro has undergone a complete brand and product reboot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This reboot brings us some new bike models. I am currently reviewing the Saguaro 1, one of Haro’s new mountain bike offerings that launched late last year. Along with the new mountain bike offerings, they also have two new drop bar offerings. Both of these UCI-approved bikes lean towards racing, the Rivette road bike which we learned about <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/haro-bikes-brand-refresh-rivette-road-buzzard-gravel-race-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and the new Buzzard gravel bike which we are learning about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Buzzard Gravel Bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Haro says that the Buzzard Gravel bike is “race-oriented, and adventure-outfitted.” For some of you when you ride, speed and efficiency are important, and for some, it’s the dirt road off to the side, that calls out to be explored. The Buzzard is ready for either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes with in-frame downtube storage, and 18 mounts to accommodate racks, fenders, and panniers for those multi-day rides. It’s UDH compatible, has internal routing, and can fit tires up to 45c in the rear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
