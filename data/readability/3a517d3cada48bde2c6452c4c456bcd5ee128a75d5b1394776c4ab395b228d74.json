Simmonds gained up to four and a half minutes before her gap started to drop with 50 km remaining.</p><p>After the intermediate spring in Mistley a group of three chasers, including two BikeExchange riders, went after Simmonds. Sarah Roy and Ane Santesteban of BikeExchange and Elise Chabbey of Canyon-SRAM hovered in between the peloton and Simmonds and with 21 km to go Simmonds lead had dropped to only a minute. She was finally picked up by the peloton with 15 km, just in time for Tenpenny Hill.</p><p>The peloton sprinted to the finish together and Wiebes once again proved the fastest.</p><hr><div><div><p>The Women's Tour (2.WWT) <span>Colchester → Clacton</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/ff/lorena-wiebes-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"3a517d3cada48bde2c6452c4c456bcd5ee128a75d5b1394776c4ab395b228d74","category":"Cycling"}
