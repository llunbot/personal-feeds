Based on my experience, they're the most common form of cargo bike on US roads. But they're not the only game in town. Bakfiets, or front-loaders, extend the other end, moving the front wheel forward to create space for a substantial cargo area.</p>\n<p>For the last few weeks, we've been testing a front-loader <a href=\"https://urbanarrow.com/en-na/family/\">called the Family</a> from Urban Arrow, a Dutch manufacturer that's a sister company to Gazelle. Everything Ars' Kevin Purdy <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/gazelle-eclipse-c380-e-bike-review-a-smart-smooth-ride-at-a-halting-price/\">wrote about the Gazelle</a> bike he tested applies here. The Urban Arrow is stylish and incredibly well thought out, and it uses some interesting tech extremely effectively. And it has the added bonus of being able to haul a surprising amount of cargo. If you can get used to the price (starting at $6,000) and the small front wheel being an appreciable distance from the handlebars you use to steer it, it's a fantastic choice.</p>\n<h2>Taking a back seat</h2>\n<p>There are a number of nice things about a front-loader design compared to a long tail. For one, the distance between the cranks and the rear wheel is typical of other bikes, meaning you don't need an extra-long chain. With no competition for space between the rear wheel and cargo, the rear wheel is also a normal size. This helps with the feel of the bike's handling and could theoretically allow the front-loader to use more standard parts for easier service. That's not entirely the case with the Family, however, as Urban Arrow went with a belt drive and internally geared hub (more on that below).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/urban-arrows-front-loader-is-a-stylish-functional-cargo-kid-hauler/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/urban-arrows-front-loader-is-a-stylish-functional-cargo-kid-hauler/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8d4a7c0dec01c8b09d2a0d7acdbc991b031ccbde1c439e2983a2469724f93dec","category":"Tech"}
