That means they are strong and have nowhere to slide down or spin around your fork legs as you ride. The direct mount also means they get rated for a <em>full 10kg in total</em> 5kg/11lb per side.

Two position options for a 3-pack Anything cage OR the ability to install two separate 2-bolt mounts. For ex. a regular water bottle cage up top, and a tool cage down below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you carry is really up to your imagination. I’ve bolted a couple up to a Manitou Mastodon fork with a couple of cages. And strapped on a tent &amp; sleeping bag. Or a couple of 1l Nalgene bottles. The most I’ve attached so far has been about 1.6kg per side. So, I’ll have to get more creative with packing to push up close to that 10kg weight limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_loaded-with-tent-and-sleeping-bag.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_loaded-with-tent-and-sleeping-bag.jpg\" alt=\"First Impressions Review: Old Man Mountain Axle Pack bolt-on fork anything cage accessory mount adapter, tent and sleeping bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_loaded-with-tent-and-sleeping-bag.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_loaded-with-tent-and-sleeping-bag-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_loaded-with-tent-and-sleeping-bag-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_loaded-with-tent-and-sleeping-bag-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_loaded-with-tent-and-sleeping-bag-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_loaded-with-tent-and-sleeping-bag-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_loaded-with-tent-and-sleeping-bag-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone have any ideas what I should carry in the snow?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details &amp; Actual weights</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_both-brackets-with-hardware-175g-actual-weight.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_both-brackets-with-hardware-175g-actual-weight.jpg\" alt=\"First Impressions Review: Old Man Mountain Axle Pack bolt-on fork anything cage accessory mount adapter, 175g brackets with hardware\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_both-brackets-with-hardware-175g-actual-weight.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_both-brackets-with-hardware-175g-actual-weight-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_both-brackets-with-hardware-175g-actual-weight-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_both-brackets-with-hardware-175g-actual-weight-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_both-brackets-with-hardware-175g-actual-weight-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_both-brackets-with-hardware-175g-actual-weight-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The core of the Old Man Mountain Axle Pack are the two brackets that extend up the side of each fork leg.

OMM claims a weight of just 73g per side, which is just a single bracket without all the necessary hardware and special axle. Still, 265g is likely as light as other clamp-on mounting solutions. And the axle mounting is rock solid, with huge carrying capacity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Figuring in a complete weigh-in… A couple of titanium King Manything Cages would be 68g a piece.

Then bolting on a 3-pack mount Anything Cage. With that said, between the Axle Pack &amp; Fit Kit – it came with 12 bolts of 3 different sizes, 6 washer/spacers of 3 different sizes, a couple of Axle Pack brackets, 8 heavy-duty Panduit zip-ties, and a replacement axle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What it didn’t include were installation instructions, just a couple of QR codes that link to the OMM support page. Part of the adventure of testing things before they officially launch… Of course, I ignored those QR thingamabobbers, and plowed ahead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of note, the Axle Pack instructions are now online (<em><a href=\"https://oldmanmountain.com/how-to-install-axle-pack/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></em>) – <em>even though persinally, I still prefer the trial-and-error method. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_incorrect-lower-bolt-installed_oops.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_incorrect-lower-bolt-installed_oops.jpg\" alt=\"First Impressions Review: Old Man Mountain Axle Pack bolt-on fork anything cage accessory mount adapter, oops wring bolt\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_incorrect-lower-bolt-installed_oops.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_incorrect-lower-bolt-installed_oops-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_incorrect-lower-bolt-installed_oops-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_incorrect-lower-bolt-installed_oops-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_incorrect-lower-bolt-installed_oops-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_correct-bolt-installation.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_correct-bolt-installation.jpg\" alt=\"First Impressions Review: Old Man Mountain Axle Pack bolt-on fork anything cage accessory mount adapter, corrected bolt\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_correct-bolt-installation.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_correct-bolt-installation-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_correct-bolt-installation-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_correct-bolt-installation-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_correct-bolt-installation-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, I switched up a couple of the longer bolts/spacers from top to bottom, at first. But it all fit and worked pretty well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I realized that installing the longer bolts and the spacer up top between the bracket &amp; plastic fork Puck better aligns everything.
