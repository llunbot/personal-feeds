The panels were placed at random while maintaining the orientation of the original painting, with drips and splatters cascading down the bags. Each piece is one of a kind, and includes a sewn-in artist label signed by Shido.</p>\n<p>Check out the full collection at <a href=\"https://ilequipment.com/collections/ile-x-shogun-shido\" target=\"_blank\">Inside Line Equipment</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/inside-line-equipment-shogun-shido/\">Inside Line Equipment Shogun Shido Collaboration II</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"d43dcc4c0f21ab6626f40cd4ee370ca59eb8cfc24736b3c0cb29c2806df4f3b6","category":"Cycling"}
