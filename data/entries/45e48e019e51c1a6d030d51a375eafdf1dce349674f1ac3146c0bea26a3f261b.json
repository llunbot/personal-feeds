Among them, Trump <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/trump-allies-want-to-make-america-first-in-ai-with-sweeping-executive-order/\">has stated</a> he plans to dismantle President Biden's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/biden-ai-executive-order-requires-safety-testing-for-ai-that-poses-serious-risk/\">AI Executive Order</a> from October 2023 immediately upon taking office.</p>\n<p>Biden's order established wide-ranging oversight of AI development.

In March, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) warned that reporting requirements could discourage innovation and prevent developments like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/\">ChatGPT</a>.
