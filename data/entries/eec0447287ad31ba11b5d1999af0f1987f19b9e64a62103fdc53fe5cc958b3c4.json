The feature is available on all iPhones with a Neural Engine, including the iPhone 8 and newer.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHalide said its Macro Mode first checks which one of your iPhone's camera lenses can focus the closest and switches to it. Then, the feature provides ultra-precise focus control down to the sub-millimeter to ensure the photo looks sharp. Finally, an AI-based feature called Neural Macro further enhances close-up details of the photo once shot.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/succulent-iphone-12-pro.jpeg\" /><div><em>Halide's sample photo shot with its Macro Mode on iPhone 12 Pro</em></div>\r\n<br />\r\nIf you already have an iPhone 13 Pro model, Halide said its Macro Mode essentially stacks on top of Apple's Macro Mode, resulting in \"staggeringly close, microscope-like shots that are even more highly magnified.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo turn on Macro Mode in the Halide app, first tap the AF button to get into manual focus, and then tap the flower button. The feature is available as a free update for all existing users, with version 2.5 of the app <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera/id885697368\">rolling out on the App Store</a> today. For new users, the Halide app is priced at $2.99 per month or $11.99 per year, or $49.99 as a one-time purchase.  <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/halide/\">Halide</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/06/halide-macro-mode-for-older-iphones/\">Halide's New Macro Mode Lets You Take Close-Up Photos Without an iPhone 13 Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/halides-new-macro-mode-lets-you-take-close-up-photos-without-an-iphone-13-pro.2315675/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rjdS9ydV6MU:BiCf6OQNXT8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rjdS9ydV6MU:BiCf6OQNXT8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/rjdS9ydV6MU\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eec0447287ad31ba11b5d1999af0f1987f19b9e64a62103fdc53fe5cc958b3c4","category":"Apple"}
