Let’s be honest and admit that choosing the best cycling glasses is as much about fashion as it is about protection, and there’s nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p>As with any cycling product though, there are far too many brands, styles and price points for any one person to trawl through. With that in mind, our expert testers have selected what they believe are the best cycling glasses on the market right now.</p>\n<p>And if you wear glasses day-to-day, our guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-prescription-cycling-glasses/\">prescription cycling glasses</a> will help you see your options clearly.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve cast your eyes over the recommendations, keep scrolling to find our buyer’s guide to cycling sunglasses.</p>\n<h2>Best cycling glasses in 2023</h2>\n<h3>Bollé Shifter</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"road cycling sunglasses\" title=\"Bollé Shifter Sunglasses\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The sweep lens is very well vented and the robust frame grips your head very well.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jesse Wild/Cycling Plus</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£149/€155/$159/AU$229 as tested</li>\n<li>Comfortable and stylish</li>\n<li>Available with prescription lenses</li>\n</ul><p>Bollé’s stylish Shifter cycling sunglasses have an angular look that somehow manages to be both thoroughly modern and a little retro.</p>\n<p>The impact-resistant, single-piece lens offers great clarity. It’s also well vented and has an anti-fogging treatment applied, so they don’t steam up too easily in humid conditions.</p>\n<p>The reassuringly robust frame feels premium and the kinked arms grip your head very well. The thickness of the frame does mean it shows up in your peripheral vision, but it didn’t bother our tester.</p>\n<p>There’s also a prescription option available, for those who need it.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/sunglasses-and-goggles/sunglasses/bolle-shifter-sunglasses-review/\">Read our full Bollé Shifter cycling sunglasses

the trend for big cycling sunglasses.</p>\n<p>The coverage of the 53mm tall, 131mm wide lens is excellent, with the chunky frame only visible at extreme angles.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the nose and ear pieces are both adjustable, so you’ll be certain to find a combination that offers a secure fit over the bumpiest of roads, and changing the lens is a simple process.</p>\n<p>Our only gripe is we’d

their original 1980s design, Scott produced the Sport Shield cycling glasses in celebration of its 60th anniversary, but less bold designs are also available.</p>\n<p>The enormous lens measures over 60mm at certain points, giving these an incredibly bold look.</p>\n<p>The frames have a sturdy, premium feel and the single-piece lens itself performs brilliantly. Coverage and protection are, thanks to their size, fantastic.</p>\n<p>The price is good, but the package only includes one lens tint, which somewhat limits their all-conditions versatility.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/sunglasses-and-goggles/sunglasses/scott-sport-shields-60th-anniversary-sunglasses-review/\">Read our full Scott Sport Shields cycling sunglasses review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Tifosi Alliant</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tifosi Alliant cycling sunglasses\" title=\"Cycling Eyewear -

If you live somewhere where it’s often dark and wet, you’ll want to consider a sunglasses package that includes multiple lens options.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, some brands offer photochromic lenses, which react to the light level to change their light transmission value, meaning they’ll automatically get darker when it’s sunny, then clearer when it’s not.</p>\n<h3>Frame</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"100% Westcraft sunglasses white\" title=\"100% Westcraft sunglasses\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Frames are very much a personal preference, though frameless glasses offer a better field of view.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sam Challis / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Frame choice is arguably more a matter of fashion because it will dictate the overall shape and look of any pair of cycling sunglasses.</p>\n<p>Big, eighties-style sunglasses are back in fashion at the moment and these do have several advantages, such as massive amounts of protection and coverage, but their bold looks aren’t for everyone.</p>\n<p>Large frames, for example, can often hover in your peripheral vision, which some riders might find annoying, whereas frameless models offer a much more unrestricted view.</p>\n<h3>Arms</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Smith Bobcat glasses for mountain bikers\" title=\"Smith Bobcat glasses - 04\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Grippy legs will keep your glasses in place over the rough stuff.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The arms of cycling sunglasses need to be robust enough to safely hold the glasses in place over even the roughest terrain. Often, tacky rubber inserts are added to increase friction without causing discomfort.</p>\n<p>High-quality models will also have reassuringly stiff arms and hinges without any play. If you’re spending a quite substantial sum of money on sunglasses, you want to know they’re built to last.</p>\n<h3>Nose bridge</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Koo Demos Sunglasses\" title=\"420 Koo Demos Glasses - 06\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some glasses feature adjustable nose pieces for a more tailored fit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James Blackwell / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Everyone has a different-shaped face and nose, so cycling sunglasses with adjustable or interchangeable nose pieces can offer a more personalised fit.</p>\n<p>This can be especially important on sunglasses with large frames, where it’s key to ensure the frame doesn’t impinge on your view too much.</p>\n<h3>Other features</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Buyer's guide to prescription cycling glasses – inserts example\" title=\"Buyer's guide to prescription cycling glasses – inserts example\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Prescription lenses can be added to many cycling glasses.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>When shopping for sunglasses, it’s worth considering the overall package. While some options just include a single lens and frame, others will include multiple lens options, a microfibre bag and possibly even a hard case.</p>\n<p>These extras all add significant value and mean you’re unlikely to need to keep spending more down the road to get, for example, a clear lens for the winter months.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you’re a glasses wearer in everyday life, it’s worth considering brands that offer prescription lenses.</p>\n<p>Contact lenses and normal lenses are certainly a viable option, but most wearers will have experienced days when wearing contact lenses for long periods of time can start to get uncomfortable.</p>","author":"Simon von Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"d99a28ee47f0908fdac777eb3a10b8311fc49a04980904c59cea0c180d900d84","category":"Cycling"}
