{"title":"Spotted: Tom Pidcock’s new Pinarello Crossista F CX bike","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/11/spotted-tom-pidcocks-new-pinarello-crossista-f-cx-bike/","date":1636113875000,"content":"<div><div><p>Tom Pidcock has posted photos of what appears to be a new Pinarello cyclocross bike. Pidcock posted the photos on a <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6211613658\" target=\"_blank\">Strava activity</a> yesterday showing the bike in the mountains above Andorra, with Ineos logos, gold accents and red, white, and blue stripes as British national cyclocross champion.</p><p>Pidcock joined the Ineos Grenadaiers at the beginning of the 2021 road season following a successful cyclocross season. Pidcock stuck with his Specialized Crux throughout last years CX season including the world championships in January of this year. Many have questioned which cyclocross bike Pidcock would race this winter season since his move to the Pinarello sponsored World Tour team. Pinarello last updated the Crossista three years ago, but now Pidcock’s CX pedigree has seemingly motivated a complete overhaul of the Italian brand’s dedicated cross-machine. With Crossista branding along the top tube and what appears to be an F on the seat tube both confirm this is a new Crossista rather than an entirely new model.</p><p>That Ineos and British champion paint job suggests the new bike is a finished article rather than some form of an early prototype. The navy with gold accents might even give us a hint as to Ineos new colours with the upcoming move from Castelli to Bio-Racer team kit. The Dura-Ace crankset also shows some hefty foot rub wear, suggesting Pidcock has spent quite some time testing and riding the new Crossista, presumably with major input into the new design. The fact Pidcock has published these photos on his Strava suggests the new bike’s official launch is not far away and some sort of teaser shots, rather than an accidental leak.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Pinarello-Crossista-F-Tom-Pidcock-1340x754.jpg\"></figure><h2>What’s new?</h2><p>A large kink on the top tube is the most prominent update to the new frame and presumably an addition designed for easier shoulder carrying when Pidcock is off and running. Such shouldering aids are nothing new, first appearing on the Colnago Prestige and lately on the Canyon Inflite. Elsewhere the bike seemingly incorporates many aero aids with truncated tubing, integrated Most Talon handlebars, and dropped seat stays very similar to those on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/pinarello-has-a-new-dogma-f-no-number-required/\">new Dogma F</a>. </p><p>The exact tyre clearance for the new bike is unclear from this photo, and despite the CX specific raised top tube, the exact geometry will perhaps be the most interesting aspect of the new Crossista. Will Pinarello stick with a dedicated cross geometry or follow the likes of Specialized and Cannondale in doubling up their new CX rigs as gravel racing machines with increased tyre clearance and longer reach? While impossible to tell from the photo, perhaps the fact Pidcock’s bike has just one bottle cage for a five-hour ride with 3,199m of climbing, might suggest the Crossista has only one mount which would be a clear indication the new bike will remain a dedicated CX machine only.</p><p>We will update this article with more information as it emerges.</p></div></div>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"73a11171d41b75860f6ec64220a6f76c64b38418021c3114bea2357903798b41","category":"Cycling"}
