Thatâ€™s why we break our <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops\">online Smashing workshops</a> down into 2.5h-sessions â€” with one session per day. This way, you always have enough time take it all in, try things out, rewatch a session or raise questions between sessions.</p>\n<p>Weâ€™re super thrilled to announce the full program of workshops for the next months to come:</p>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/brad-frost-nov/\"><div>Creating and Maintaining Successful Design Systems<img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/502cf7a10bd06fcb572acfb8b0592d9b28c50975/11b60/images/speakers/brad-frost.jpg\" /></div><div>Brad Frost</div><div>5 sessions Nov 30 â€“ Dec 14 workflow</div></a><a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/lea-verou-nov/\"><div>Dynamic CSS Masterclass<img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5ef0f3cb554cb09cf3d34f293f5ee3fa5a742e49/91e2b/images/speakers/lea-verou.png\" /></div><div>Lea Verou</div><div>4 sessions Nov 29 â€“ Dec 14 css</div></a><a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/yury-vetrov/\"><div>Design Management Masterclass<img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/81e85d206622f50174b8793ffebfb4c139194e43/f323b/images/speakers/yury-vetrov.jpg\" /></div><div>Yury Vetrov</div><div>5 sessions Dec 1â€“15 ux</div></a><a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/vitaly-friedman-navigation-dec/\">Early birds!<div>Designing The Perfect Navigation<img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c21ac313bd003251245fe0ec848a83b26157fef5/a6b54/images/speakers/vitaly-friedman.jpg\" /></div><div>Vitaly Friedman</div><div>2 sessions Dec 2â€“3 ux</div></a><a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/carie-fisher-jan/\">Early birds!<div>Accessible Front-End Patterns Masterclass<img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f84c61767dea414d2b87f306d86de71eba9bb39e/7502a/images/speakers/carie-fisher.jpg\" /></div><div>Carie Fisher</div><div>5 sessions Jan 20 â€“ Feb 3 dev</div></a><a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/vitaly-friedman-frontend-feb/\">Early birds!<div>New Adventures In Front-End, 2022 Edition<img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c21ac313bd003251245fe0ec848a83b26157fef5/a6b54/images/speakers/vitaly-friedman.jpg\" /></div><div>Vitaly Friedman</div><div>5 sessions Feb 3â€“17 dev</div></a><a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/gleb-bahmutov/\">Early birds!<div>Front-End Testing Masterclass<img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c617057a855d75af61034a896ef5a56b100c6da5/919aa/images/speakers/gleb-bahmutov.jpg\" /></div><div>Gleb Bahmutov</div><div>4 sessions Feb 8â€“16 dev</div></a><a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/trine-falbe/\">Early birds!<div>Ethical Design Masterclass<img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/67cd8f94b812463c401dcff71d524d4b8f18b517/ee589/images/speakers/trine-falbe.jpg\" /></div><div>Trine Falbe</div><div>5 sessions 1â€“15 March ux</div></a><a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/bundles#/\"><div>10Ã— Tickets Bundle<img src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/da6e9dee46f4008c7c1c3735e3571e77086b321a/8aa3f/images/events/online-workshops/summer-cat.png\" /></div><div>Save $1250 off the price.</div><div>10 tickets No expiry Smashing!</div></a></div><div></div>\n\n<p>Our online workshops take place <strong>live</strong> and span <strong>multiple days across weeks.</strong> In every session, there is always enough time to bring up your questions or just get a cup of tea. We donâ€™t rush through the content, but instead, try to create a welcoming, <strong>friendly and inclusive environment for everyone</strong> to have time to think, discuss and get feedback.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/smashing-workshop-form-design-masterclass/\">things to expect from a Smashing workshop</a>, but the most important one is focusing on practical examples and techniques. The workshops arenâ€™t talks; they are interactive, with live conversations with attendees, sometimes with challenges, homework and team work. Of course, you get all workshop materials and <strong>video recordings</strong> as well, so if you miss a session you can re-watch it the same day.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\">Jump to all workshops â†’</a></div>\n\nSmashingConf San Francisco 2022\n<p>Yes, itâ€™s official!
