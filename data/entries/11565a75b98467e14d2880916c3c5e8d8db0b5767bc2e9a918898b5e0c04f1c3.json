From potting soil to pots, books, and apparel, it had it all. Well, that store has closed, but the brand has a greenhouse shop in NYC and an online store where they sell lots of nature-nerd apparel. Coinciding rather closely with our <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/from-biocrust-with-love/\" target=\"_blank\">From Biocrust, With Love</a>, video project, the brand re-upped the “Don’t Bust The Crust” shirts, officially licensed and all.
