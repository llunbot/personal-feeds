Today, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq4uCJDwO9U\">a short livestreamed video presentation</a> gave a bit of extra information about how exactly the full version of the free-roaming Nintendo Switch 2 launch game will work in practice.</p>\n<p>As the name implies, <em>Mario Kart World</em> sets itself apart from previous games via a \"vast interconnected world\" that you can roam freely between the actual race courses. That open space between races will feature \"hundreds of P-switches,\" Nintendo said, each of which activates a small mission to \"hone your driving abilities.\" Free-roaming racers will also be able to find hidden medallions and question-mark panels, as well as \"drive-thru\" food items that can be used to unlock new outfits.</p>\n<img width=\"2553\" height=\"1425\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mkworld5.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mkworld5.png 2553w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mkworld5-640x357.png 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mkworld5-1024x572.png 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mkworld5-768x429.png 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mkworld5-1536x857.png 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mkworld5-2048x1143.png 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mkworld5-980x547.png 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mkworld5-1440x804.png 1440w\" />\n      \"Hundreds\" of P-Switches like this will activate short missions throughout the game's world.\n        Credit:\n          Nintendo\n      \n<p>While cruising around the Mario Kart \"world,\" players will stumble onto new courses \"inspired by their surrounding region,\" as well as \"nostalgic courses for past titles... reimagined and spread throughout the world.\" When playing in Grand Prix mode, the drive between these courses will be integrated into the usual four-course cups themselves; after racing Mario Kart Circuit in the Mushroom cup, for instance, the second race \"will have you covering the distance from Mario Bros. Circuit to Crown City,\" Nintendo said.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/what-do-you-actually-do-in-mario-kart-worlds-vast-open-world/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/what-do-you-actually-do-in-mario-kart-worlds-vast-open-world/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1652fa9790ec4740401c57a0d59712d200a6df9b902b226f74384dc4fd77ae95","category":"Tech"}
