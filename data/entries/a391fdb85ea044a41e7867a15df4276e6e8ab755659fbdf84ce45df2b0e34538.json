The satellites are loaded with sophisticated sensors and ranging instruments to allow the two spacecraft to orbit the Earth in lockstep with one another. Proba-3 will attempt to achieve millimeter-scale precision, several orders of magnitude better than the requirements for a spacecraft closing in for docking at the International Space Station.</p>\n<p>\"In a nutshell, it’s an experiment in space to demonstrate a new concept, a new technology that is technically challenging,\" said Damien Galano, Proba-3's project manager.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/two-european-satellites-launch-on-mission-to-blot-out-the-sun-for-science/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/two-european-satellites-launch-on-mission-to-blot-out-the-sun-for-science/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a391fdb85ea044a41e7867a15df4276e6e8ab755659fbdf84ce45df2b0e34538","category":"Tech"}
