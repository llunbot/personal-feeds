But it’s the brand that isn’t in attendance that’s generating the most buzz. After appearing on site and setting up their tent, Kona Bicycles then tore down that same tent before the show even started. By the time we rolled into the venue on Wednesday at the end of our ride with Otso Bicycles, the space for Kona’s tent was already vacant (circled above).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move is a head-scratcher for a number of reasons – the brand had just unveiled a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kona-ouroboros-gravel-adventure-dropbar-mtb/\" target=\"_blank\">new adventure bike</a> as the show opened, and it seems like a strange move considering they had already paid to get their booth to the venue and set it up. However, the day after their mysterious exit, it was announced that <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kona-bicycles-is-acquired-by-a-former-watersports-company/\" target=\"_blank\">Kona’s parent company, Kent Outdoors</a>, had just appointed a new CFO. According to the press release, new CFO Rob Otto has experience “improving profitability and operational efficiencies along with managing integrations”. Conspicuously absent from the press release is any mention of Kona Bicycles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve poked around Sea Otter to find more details, but for now, no one is willing to make any sort of comment on the record. <a href=\"https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2024/04/17/wheres-kona-brand-sets-then-breaks-down-sea-otter\" target=\"_blank\">BRAIN reported </a>earlier in the week that the company expected to have a “town hall” meeting on Thursday, which seems likely to have taken place, but without any further news. We’ll keep digging, but for now, the future of Kona remains up for interpretation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PR</strong> <strong>From Kent Outdoors</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Executive Hire is Part of Company’s Strategic Investment in Leadership, Innovation and Operations</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>SALT LAKE CITY, April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — Kent Outdoors (“Kent” or the “Company”), which has been helping people in their pursuit of outdoor adventures for more than 60 years, is pleased to announce that it has added Rob Ottoto the company’s executive management team as the company’s chief financial officer.
