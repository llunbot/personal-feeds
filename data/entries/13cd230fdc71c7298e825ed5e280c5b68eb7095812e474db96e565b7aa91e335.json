The change with the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro models means that the devices should get slightly taller, rather than wider. While the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro models have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/28/gurman-corroborates-iphone-16-pro-size-increase/\">widely rumored</a> to feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/\">larger screens</a> for some time, the aspect ratio of the devices was unclear until now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYoung also provided exact display sizes for the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max. The devices are expected to increase from 6.12- and 6.69-inches to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. This represents a display size increase of 2.5% on both devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the ‌iPhone‌ 17 and ‌iPhone‌ 17 Plus in 2025, Apple will apparently bring the larger 6.27- and 6.86-inch display sizes to its two standard ‌iPhone‌ models. As Young has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/promotion-standard-iphones-2025/\">previously reported</a>, these devices are also expected to gain LTPO panels to support ProMotion for variable refresh rates up to 120Hz. This means that the standard ‌iPhone‌ 17 models look set to receive a substantial display upgrade, with larger sizes and LPTO for ProMotion.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, Young reaffirmed his previous statement that the ‌iPhone‌ 17 Pro models will be the first to feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/\">under-display Face ID technology</a>, sitting alongside a hole-shaped cutout for the front-facing camera.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/iphone-16-pro-to-feature-taller-aspect-ratio/\">iPhone 16 Pro to Feature Taller Aspect Ratio, Regular iPhone 17 to Follow and Add ProMotion in 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-to-feature-taller-aspect-ratio-regular-iphone-17-to-follow-and-add-promotion-in-2025.2390880/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"13cd230fdc71c7298e825ed5e280c5b68eb7095812e474db96e565b7aa91e335","category":"Apple"}
