That was to be expected at <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/la-fleche-wallonne-femmes-preview-route-predictions-and-contenders\">Flèche Wallonne</a>, one of the world’s most coveted Classics. But year in, year out, this race is about much more than its winners and losers. It’s about the Mur de Huy, one of the sport’s most sacred landmarks, that hosts to an annual coming together between fans and cyclists. It’s bike racings version of a block party. And it is not to be missed!</p>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>Tucked in the middle of the week, the Flèche Wallonne could easily be overlooked. Yet it is one of the world’s most esteemed races. Now in its 87<sup>th</sup> edition (25<sup>th</sup> for the women), the race is unique, and much of it is due to the race’s spectacular finish. </span></p>\n<p><span>Barely a kilomenter long, the Mur de Huy is seemingly without end, as the rider’s must negotiate the narrow road with its steep pitches that surpass 20%. But the Mur is also an ideal stage for the fans to see the stars, as each race tackles this wall no less than three times. It is no wonder that fans flock here year in, year out. It’s simply a great way to spend a day, watching great racing from morning well into the afternoon, and cheering for the crème-de-la-crème of international cycling. Oh, and the frites and beer is pretty good too!</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/01Mur_de_Huy_Gallery03_peloton_Kasia_Nieuwiadoma_fans_Fleche_03_2023.jpg?v=1681922426\" alt /></div>\n<p><span>Basking in the early-morning sun, the women make their way up the Mur for the first time.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/00Mur_de_Huy_Gallery01_Fleche_03_2023.jpg?v=1681925668\" alt /></div>\n<p><span>The town’s name is painted up the entire final climb.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/02Mur_de_Huy_Gallery01_Kasia_Nieuwiadoma_fans_Fleche_03_2023.jpg?v=1681925691\" alt /></div>\n<p><span>Kasia Nieuwiadoma’s fans were some of the first to arrive.</span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/04Mur_de_Huy_Gallery04.jpg?v=1681925775\" alt /></div>\n<p><span>Off the back is nowhere to spend your day on the Mur de Huy.
