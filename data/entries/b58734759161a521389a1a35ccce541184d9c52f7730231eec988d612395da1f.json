The current 10th-gen iPad arrived in October 2022 and is long overdue for an update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a new report, however, the wait is almost over. And, perhaps unsurprisingly given that it’s been two and a half years since the last model, we can expect a serious upgrade in processing power for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2024-release-date.html\">11th generation</a>. No physical redesign, but a major component refresh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the latest edition of his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on\">Power On newsletter</a>, Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman predicts that the 11th-gen iPad will come out this spring and that it will support Apple Intelligence. From this latter claim, it follows that a significant hardware bump will be required: from the current A14 and 4GB of RAM in the 10th-gen iPad to an A17 Pro and 8GB. Overkill for a budget tablet, perhaps, but the minimum required to run Apple Intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new iPad models, Gurman adds, have the internal codenames J481 and J482. It’s understood that the 10th-gen iPad was referred to at Apple Park as J272.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 11th-gen iPad’s hefty spec bump matches the similar one heading to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE</a> this spring. It’s a key part of Cupertino’s AI strategy to recruit as many Apple Intelligence users as possible: It wants to take the platform mainstream, build up mindshare, and acquire training data. For this reason, it makes sense for the cheapest and therefore biggest-selling models in each lineup to offer Apple Intelligence support, even if that requires a bigger-than-usual hardware upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the 11th-gen iPad, Apple is expected to launch new iPad Air models in the spring of 2025. These, too, will be physically identical to their predecessors from 2024, with a spec bump being the focus. Gurman says he “wouldn’t be terribly surprised if the 2025 models get bumped up [from the current M2] to the M4, matching the iPad Pro.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That latter point is especially surprising because he also doesn’t expect the iPad Pro’s M5 update until late 2025 or early 2026. That means we can expect up to a year in which the Pro and Air models are running on largely the same chipset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s unknown whether Apple will announce the new iPhone SE and these new iPad models at a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">spring event</a>, or simply slip them out in a press release. There was a spring event in 2024 and 2022, but not in 2023; your guess is as good as ours.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b58734759161a521389a1a35ccce541184d9c52f7730231eec988d612395da1f","category":"Apple"}
