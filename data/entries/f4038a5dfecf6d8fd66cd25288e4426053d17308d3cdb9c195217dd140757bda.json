She didn't get into specifics but confirmed that Prime Video's ad load would \"ramp up a little bit more into 2025.\"</p>\n<p>In January, when Amazon <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amazon-jacks-up-price-of-ad-free-prime-video-by-2-99-starting-in-2024/\">launched Prime Video's ad tier</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/amazon-is-now-charging-prime-members-extra-for-ad-free-streaming-for-some-thats-a-deal-breaker-068d4896\">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported that subscribers would see an average of between two and three-and-a-half minutes of ads per hour. Day told FT today that upon launch, Prime Video with ads was given a \"very light ad load,\" providing subscribers with a “gentle entry into advertising that has exceeded customers' expectations in terms of what the ad experience would be like.\" The executive pointed out that Prime Video with ads doesn't show commercials in the middle of content. That could change next year.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/amazon-prime-video-is-getting-more-ads-next-year/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/amazon-prime-video-is-getting-more-ads-next-year/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f4038a5dfecf6d8fd66cd25288e4426053d17308d3cdb9c195217dd140757bda","category":"Tech"}
