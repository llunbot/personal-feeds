The feature is still slowly rolling out to devices; on my Android phone, I don't have a \"headphone\" icon anywhere, even with a Plus subscription.</p>\n<p>When you have the feature, you can open the app, press the \"headphone\" icon, ask a question, and a stilted robot voice will read out a reply. It's just like the voice assistants from Apple, Amazon, or Google, but this one is powered by a large language model. ChatGPT's voice model is purely a question-and-answer type of voice assistant, though. Usually, these things are handy for what they can do on your behalf‚Äîmake a phone call, control a smart home, take a note, or make a calendar appointment‚Äîbut this can only answer questions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ChatGPT with voice is now available to all free users. Download the app on your phone and tap the headphones icon to start a conversation.</p>\n<p>Sound on <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f50a.png\" alt=\"üîä\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/c5sCFDAWU6\">pic.twitter.com/c5sCFDAWU6</a></p>\n<p>‚Äî OpenAI (@OpenAI) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1727065166188274145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-google-assistant-is-getting-a-big-reboot-around-generative-ai/\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amazons-generative-ai-powered-alexa-is-as-big-a-privacy-red-flag-as-old-alexa/\">Amazon</a> are rebooting their voice assistants to use large language models, so ChatGPT's voice functionality is definitely a preview of the future. The demo about buying pizza for a large group is more complicated than the current Big Tech voice assistants can handle. ChatGPT's response is also longer-winded than most voice assistants, giving a 66-word, 23-second answer describing the imagined pizza-eating scenario in excruciating detail.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986046#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986046&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ba0969961c956ae364674d48043f9f30e2012a7bc4827b231a7fabcadc4c0f2b","category":"Tech"}
