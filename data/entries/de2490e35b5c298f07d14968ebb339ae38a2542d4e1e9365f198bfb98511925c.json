Dimitris worked alongside <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/we-have-to-change-the-way-we-travel-for-good-chris-boardman-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Boardman</a> in the Secret Squirrel Club, creating the pioneering bikes and kit that helped Team GB dominate the London 2012 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Olympics</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever wondered where the term ‘marginal gains’ came from? Yep, Dimitris and his colleagues, whose work at the time was so secret not even his boss, one Dave Brailsford, was allowed to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across a career spanning three decades and counting, Dimitris has had a hand in winning over 100 gold Olympic and World cycling medals, and right now his components and creations can be seen on four national teams’ Olympic bikes (though he won’t say which ones). Today he runs his own company, Metron A.E, which 3D-prints cutting edge parts for sport, aerospace and the medical industry. He also 3D-printed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/filippo-ganna-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">Fillipo Ganna’s Hour record</a> Pinarello Bolide F. The <em>entire </em>bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a man who has a story about everyone from Wiggins to Ganna, and who can explain aerodynamic drag with just his hands. So pop the kettle on or jump on the turbo, and prepare to be enlightened.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/cyclist-magazine-podcast/episodes/111-dimitris-katsanis-makes-the-worlds-fastest-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 111 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know <em>Cyclist</em> is also stunning monthly magazine?
