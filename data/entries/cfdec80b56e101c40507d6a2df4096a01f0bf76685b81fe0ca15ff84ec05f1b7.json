It’s late February 2022 and the CEO of the Flanders Classics organisation has tweeted a photograph of a barriered section of gently rising Belgian cobblestoned road. Underneath are the words: ‘Only three more sleeps. So ready.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following day he tweets a picture of the famous chapel on the Muur van Geraardsbergen and a simple: ‘Two!’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gent-wevelgem-preview\">Gent-Wevelgem 2023: Route, riders, TV and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 138: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Cycling spring Classics 2023: Race dates, Monuments, cobbles and live TV guide</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-route-riders-sportive-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Flanders 2023: All you need to know including route, how to watch, start list, history and sportive</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-opening-weekend\" target=\"_blank\">opening weekend</a> of the Classics is close and the 43-year-old head of one of cycle sport’s most influential race organisers is counting down the days like a child before Christmas. It’s great to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cobbled together</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Den Spiegel is still making his way into his office when he logs in for his call with <i>Cyclist</i>. It is early and he has a busy day ahead. Tomorrow brings the 2022 editions of the women’s and men’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/omloop-het-nieuwsblad-guide\" target=\"_blank\">Omloop Het Nieuwsblad</a>, the first of this year’s Flanders Classics road races, and the curtain raisers for the spring Classics season. Hence those photos on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We still have some last-minute issues but everything is looking good,’ Van Den Spiegel says as he walks. ‘We have some farmers that want to use the race tomorrow for a protest, so we will solve that today – it’s not the first time. Everything else is OK.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"603\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-02-970x603.jpg\" alt=\"Flanders Classics\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-02-970x603.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-02-300x187.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-02-768x477.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-02-750x466.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-02-1140x709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Our riders gather outside Oudenaarde Town Hall in the city’s main square, with Peloton de Paris’ Shelly De Smedt (left) Charity Bengert (right) and Cycling in Flanders’ Dries Verclyte on photos</figcaption><figcaption>Robbrecht Desmet / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The return of crowds to the roadsides after the lifting of Covid restrictions has increased his anticipation: ‘Having the feeling that at last you are doing something for the fans is very exciting. As a cycling fan I am excited for every race, not just ours. I’m very happy.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the grand scheme of cycle race promoters, Flanders Classics is a relatively recent arrival. The organisation was established by the Belgian media entrepreneur and now president of RSC Anderlecht football club, Wouter Vandenhaute, in 2009.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vandenhaute, who Van Den Spiegel says ‘has a huge passion for sports’, wanted to create an organisation to bring together some of Belgium’s most celebrated one-day races. He acquired the rights to the Ronde van Vlaanderen (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-route-riders-sportive-and-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">Tour of Flanders</a>) and Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and in 2010 brought the two races together under the Flanders Classics brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go to the <a href=\"https://www.flandersclassics.be/en\" target=\"_blank\">Flanders Classics website</a> now and you will find six major one-day road races listed, with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gent-wevelgem-preview\" target=\"_blank\">Gent-Wevelgem</a>, Dwars Door Vlaanderen, Scheldeprijs and De Brabantse Pijl having since been added to Omloop and De Ronde in the organisation’s portfolio. And it doesn’t stop there.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"855\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-03-970x855.jpg\" alt=\"Flanders Classics\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-03-970x855.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-03-300x265.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-03-768x677.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-03-750x661.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-03-1140x1005.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Robbrecht Desmet / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Today we are directly or indirectly involved in around 70 to 80 events every year,’ says Van Den Spiegel. ‘Classics of course, but also a lot of cyclocross, mass-participation events and others. So we’ve evolved, but the main brand remains the spring Classics.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organisation now employs 35 to 40 people at any one time, growing into the thousands on race days. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making every race special</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Den Spiegel joined Flanders Classics as CEO in 2018. A former professional basketball player until 2013, playing in Russia and Spain during his 18-year career, he developed a strong interest in the business side of sport while grabbing rebounds and making hook shots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘During my career I tried to understand the business models behind different sports, and I’m Flemish so I was a huge cycling fan growing up and I still am. I was able to put the two together,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strategy to bundle Belgium’s one-day races under a single organisation came from the challenges cycling’s current business model presents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘A lot of the standalone organisers were having a hard time putting their races on, getting the right budgets and funding,’ says Van Den Spiegel. ‘Bundling them allowed us to use the Tour of Flanders as the main brand to strengthen the other races.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, over the years each race had already developed its own identity and history. Each had its own place in the hearts of cycling fans and there is surely a danger that by bringing them together under one brand you dilute the uniqueness of each event and lose what makes each race special. How does the organisation protect against the races becoming homogenised?</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"736\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-04-736x970.jpg\" alt=\"Flanders Classics\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-04-736x970.jpg 736w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-04-228x300.jpg 228w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-04-768x1012.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-04-750x989.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-04.jpg 1000w\" /><figcaption>The start of Oude Kwaremont, Flanders’ longest cobbled climb at 2.2km, averaging 4% and peaking at 11.6%</figcaption><figcaption>Robbrecht Desmet / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘We are the kind of organisation that is always looking to collaborate,’ says Van Den Spiegel. ‘So even if we acquire a race, we are not just going to come in and take everything over. We still try to keep the people on board, retain the traditions and look for local collaboration.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example Van Den Spiegel cites Gent-Wevelgem, a race in which Flanders Classics had a minority stake but has recently fully acquired. ‘We don’t plan on changing anything. We always try to keep the elements from the past that we like and that are typical for that event. Cycling is built on a lot of tradition and we try to keep that.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He says the design of the course is key to maintaining a race’s identity: ‘We don’t want Gent-Wevelgem to look like a mini Tour of Flanders. We put a lot of energy and time into designing courses. I think we have some real specialists who really understand how to build the right course and how to build an identity around that.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless change is sometimes needed. Van Den Spiegel says he is allergic to the phrase ‘we’ve always done it like this’, and sometimes change, for example to a race’s route to accommodate a new start or finish location, can provoke a furious reaction from the cycling community, both locally and internationally. The removal of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/is-the-muur-van-geraardsbergen-flanders-greatest-climb\" target=\"_blank\">Muur van Geraardsbergen</a> from the Tour of Flanders route in 2012 is an obvious example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This is Flanders,’ says Van Den Spiegel. ‘All of these big cycling races are kind of national holidays. They are really, really important and you can feel that when sometimes you think you have to change something. You can see how emotional people are about the race and the changes that you put in place. It’s very sensitive. We live cycling here every day. It’s about trying to merge Flemish heritage with today’s values.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Working for equality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Flanders Classics organises men’s and women’s elite editions of the six major road races in its portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We launched a five-year plan in 2018/19 where we said we needed to try to upgrade our women’s races to the level of the men’s,’ says Van Den Spiegel, who explains that despite previous efforts and investment the organisation had recognised that the women’s editions weren’t at the level they wanted. ‘We needed to invest further and that is what we have done over the past few years.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A main strand to that effort has been working to upgrade the categories of the organisation’s women’s races, including a recent attempt to align the women’s Omloop Het Nieuwsblad with the men’s by upgrading it to WorldTour status.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Flanders Classics\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The Paterberg is 400m long, averaging 12%, sharpening to 20.3% and ascended not once but twice at this year’s Tour of Flanders, at 51km and 13km to go</figcaption><figcaption>Robbrecht Desmet / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ultimately the UCI didn’t approve that request, saying that it wanted to take time to ensure it was were creating a balanced women’s calendar for the future. Van Den Spiegel says he understood the reasoning and is keen to stress Flanders Classics works ‘in a positive manner’ with the UCI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His experience of being a member of FIBA’s Players’ Commission (basketball’s governing body) before his arrival at Flanders Classics helps his perspective, saying that while he doesn’t always agree with everything governing bodies might do, ‘until you sit on the other end you don’t realise it’s not always easy’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year Flanders Classics confirmed that from 2023 equal prize money would be awarded across the men’s and women’s editions of its six main races, later accelerating that decision for the 2022 Tour of Flanders. The announcement brought positive headlines, but while Van Den Spiegel understands the importance of the messaging, he is adamant it is far from the most important development the organisation has brought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’ve always said that I see equal prize money as the last step in this process,’ he says. ‘What the sport needs are the resources bottom-up, for grass roots but also for the teams because a lot of them are still struggling with budgets. What we have to do is attract money into the sport. You do that with a better product and with the resources we generate from cycling, putting that into teams bottom-up, instead of top-down through prize money.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This strategy is why upgrading race status is important – the higher the race classification the more start money that goes to teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This is something that the riders have spoken about on many occasions as well,’ Van Den Spiegel says. ‘The top riders are saying that they want the sport to improve, not just their own financial situation.

You need to make sure your product is the right product. It would be very easy and very symbolic and a good message if you addressed prize money first, but at the same time I think you need to build the sport in the first place.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"742\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-06-742x970.jpg\" alt=\"Flanders Classics\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-06-742x970.jpg 742w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-06-229x300.jpg 229w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-06-768x1004.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-06-1175x1536.jpg 1175w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-06-750x981.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-06-1140x1491.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Nearing the climax of the Koppenberg, often cited as Flanders’ toughest climb thanks to a near-perpetually greasy surface and a 10.2% average gradient that peaks at 20%</figcaption><figcaption>Robbrecht Desmet / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Van Den Spiegel says that while the organisation’s work towards gender equality is ‘something logical’, he is focussed on the business side of women’s cycling, as you would expect the CEO of a race promoter to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It is a standalone, attractive product so we really do believe in the commercial potential in the long run,’ he says. ‘That’s why we’ve always tried to be a pioneer in this area.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he thinks Flanders Classics has made a difference to the wider sport, and been a force for change. ‘The fact that there is a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-roubaix-femmes-inside-v-lodrome-andr-p-trieux\" target=\"_blank\">Paris-Roubaix women’s race</a> now and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a>, I think we have played a minor part in that by really pushing hard and trying to have as many women’s races as possible on our calendar.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mapping the future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our time is drawing to a close. We talk briefly about the organisation’s move into esports – ‘it is something that every modern sports organisation should look into and something that we are working hard on’ – and youth category racing – ‘I always thought it would be nice if we were able to offer the Tour of Flanders to all categories, and we will do it for the first time in 2022.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before he leaves, <i>Cyclist</i> asks Van Den Spiegel to look forward ten years.

I think the sport has to evolve. Cycling, probably more than any sport, is very traditional but it needs to be aware of that. Things might change very quickly. We need to be able to adjust to change really quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I always say that I was hired to make the organisation, but also cycling in Flanders, future-proof. That asks for a lot of flexibility and to be able to adjust. I think that is the main challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Organising road races here, just from a practical point of view, becomes harder and harder. We need to be able to find solutions for that. The media climate is also evolving very quickly, so again we need to be ready for that. So there are a lot of challenges but at the same time it is very exciting in these times to be doing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Cycling is such a beautiful sport and offers so many possibilities. For something like football the framework is much stricter. You have the stadium, strong governing bodies. You need to fit what you do into that model. In cycling we can be more entrepreneurial – we can invent things, be creative. We can do stuff. And I think that is what is fun about this sport.’   </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mud and glory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Flanders Classics and the rise of cyclocross</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"760\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-08-760x970.jpg\" alt=\"Flanders Classics\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-08-760x970.jpg 760w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-08-235x300.jpg 235w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-08-768x980.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-08-750x958.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-08-1140x1455.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/flanders-classics-08.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Robbrecht Desmet / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In 2019 Flanders Classics reached out beyond road racing and acquired the rights to run the UCI Cyclocross World Cup series. Van Den Spiegel says there were several reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Of course, it is big in Flanders so we really know <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-rise-of-cyclocross\" target=\"_blank\">cyclocross</a>. It’s a great TV product – short at around an hour, on a closed circuit and with a lot of commercial possibilities. And it already had gender equality, or very close to it, in pay but also in viewing numbers and ratings. We thought it was a very attractive product.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Den Spiegel also points to the versatility of riders such as Wout van Aert and Mathieu van der Poel: ‘Cyclocross had momentum because we had these crazy kids that ride cyclocross bikes and mountain bikes dominating road racing as well. They are very inspirational. There were a lot of factors that allowed us, or even pushed us, into cyclocross.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2019 the calendar has expanded from its heartland into Spain and Italy too, with a round in London rumoured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Flanders still is the centre of cyclocross, both when it comes to the calendar and from a financial point of view,’ says Van Den Spiegel. ‘We think it can be much bigger than that in the future.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thanks to our guides for the tour of Flanders’ highlights.
