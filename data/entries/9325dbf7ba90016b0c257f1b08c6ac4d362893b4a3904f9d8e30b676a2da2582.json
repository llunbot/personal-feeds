Today I was able to sit in the back and relax while people were fighting for the breakaway.</p>\n<p>'Even though I felt it in the legs a little bit from yesterday, I managed to get over the two climbs and in the end Jens Keukeleire did a very amazing job delivering me perfectly for the sprint.’</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/5020/tour-de-france-2018-dan-martin-takes-victory-at-m-r-de-bretagne-as-froome-and-bardet-lose\">Tour de France 2018: Dan Martin takes victory at Mûr de Bretagne as Froome and Bardet lose time</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/5482/still-hungry-dan-martin-profile\">Still hungry: Dan Martin profile</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThe day began with a hilly route out of Jaén and the peloton scaled the Alto de San Jerónimo before the category two Puerto de Catorce Por Ciento.</p>\n<p>As predicted, there was no major shakeup to the overall classification.
