Called FORCEDENTRY, the exploit could infect an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, Apple Watch, or Mac <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/19/pegasus-spyware-imessage-targets-activists/\">with the Pegasus spyware</a>, providing access to the camera and microphone in addition to allowing access to text messages, phone calls, and emails.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFORCEDENTRY was distributed by Israel's NSO Group to governments and various other entities, and The Citizen Lab discovered it after analyzing the ‌iPhone‌ of a Saudi activist. Details were sent to Apple on September 7, and Apple took a week to fix the bug. According to The Citizen Lab, FORCEDENTRY has been in use since at least February 2021.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"This spyware can do everything an ‌iPhone‌ user can do on their device and more,\" said Citizen Lab senior researcher John-Scott Railton.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212807\">lists the fix</a> as CVE-2021-30860, and described it as a maliciously crafted PDF that could lead to arbitrary code execution.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBack in July, a slew of media reports highlighted <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/19/pegasus-spyware-imessage-targets-activists/\">zero-click iMessage exploits</a> called Pegasus, which were distributed by Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group and were used to target journalists, lawyers, and human rights activists around the world. A database of more than 50,000 people who had been targeted by NSO's clients was made public at the time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Pegasus spyware is notable because it skirts BlastDoor, specific <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/28/messages-blastdoor-ios-14-security-system/\">iMessage protections</a> that Apple put into place in with the launch of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>. BlastDoor is a sandbox security system for Messages that's designed to prevent exploits like Pegasus, but it's still a work in progress.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple told <em>The New York Times</em> that it plans to add spyware barriers to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> software update to prevent similar attacks in the future.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/security/\">security</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-security/\">Apple security</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/13/ios-14-8-zero-click-exploit-pegasus/\">Apple's iOS 14.8 Update Fixes Zero-Click Exploit Used to Distribute Pegasus Spyware</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-ios-14-8-update-fixes-zero-click-exploit-used-to-distribute-pegasus-spyware.2310595/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hXyXoIDbuIE:owBZgLw3hBc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hXyXoIDbuIE:owBZgLw3hBc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/hXyXoIDbuIE\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ec2a442dfc1e7b03bcf9b2c53845c6263048664d7e32c015b912cba436083138","category":"Apple"}
