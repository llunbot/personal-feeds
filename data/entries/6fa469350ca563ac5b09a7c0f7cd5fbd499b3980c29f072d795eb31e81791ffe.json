The same team has now analyzed two of the locks for toxic substances and found extremely high levels of lead, as well as arsenic and mercury, according to a <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/advance-article/doi/10.1093/clinchem/hvae054/7651113\">recent letter</a> published in the journal Clinical Chemistry.</p>\n<p>“It definitely shows Beethoven was exposed to high concentrations of lead,” Paul Janetto, co-author and director of the Mayo Clinic's Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/health/beethoven-deaf-lead-hair.html\">told The New York Times</a>. “These are the highest values in hair I’ve ever seen. We get samples from around the world, and these values are an order of magnitude higher.” That said, the authors concluded that the lead exposure was not sufficient to actually kill the composer, although Beethoven very likely did suffer adverse health effects because of it.</p>\n<p>As<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/beethovens-genome-sequenced-for-first-time-yields-clues-on-cause-of-death/\"> previously reported</a>, Beethoven was plagued throughout his life by myriad health problems. The composer began losing his hearing in his mid- to late 20s, experiencing tinnitus and the loss of high-tone frequencies in particular. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven#Deafness\">He claimed</a> the onset began with a fit in 1798 induced by a quarrel with a singer. By his mid-40s, he was functionally deaf and unable to perform public concerts, although he could still compose music.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023745#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023745&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6fa469350ca563ac5b09a7c0f7cd5fbd499b3980c29f072d795eb31e81791ffe","category":"Tech"}
