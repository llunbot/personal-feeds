We plan to start the pilot\nwith a phased approach, welcoming people back to the office for\none or two days a week for an initial period of four weeks. After\nthis transitional period, we will begin the pilot in full, with\neligible teams in the office three days a week, on Monday,\nTuesday, and Thursday, and with flexibility to work remotely on\nWednesday and Friday. You’ll receive more details about how the\nfirst four-week phase will roll out as we get closer to the\nreturn date.</p>\n\n<p>As I noted when we announced our hybrid work pilot, we do have a\nnumber of teams whose work requires a greater need to work\nin-person, and they will come into the office four or five days a\nweek based on the plans for these specific teams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Read: folks who work on hardware.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At the same time, we are committed to giving you more flexibility\nas we move forward. In addition to the option of working remotely\ntwice a week on Wednesday and Friday, we announced this summer\nthat team members would be able to work remotely for up to two\nweeks per year with a manager’s approval. I’m pleased to share\nthat we’re increasing the amount of time you can work remotely to\na total of four weeks per year. This provides more opportunity to\ntravel, be closer to your loved ones, or simply shake up your\nroutines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sensible, measured, and adaptable to changing conditions. Apple’s years-long response to the pandemic regarding its workforce (including retail) has been utterly Cook-ian.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/19/apple-return-to-office-february\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4f0ea923ecccb9048959bde1e7cb2a0dd06fa4e601c85ab57ef8ced921437535","category":"Tech"}
