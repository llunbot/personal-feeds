Watching the very best riders go toe to toe in the high mountains is what the sport is all about, and many climbs owe their revered status to the epic battles we’ve seen unfold on their slopes over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, however, <em>not</em> seeing the action can be just as effective in building a climb’s reputation. Take the Passo Giau in the Dolomites, which featured at the business end of Stage 16 of the 2021 Giro d’Italia. Ineos Grenadiers’ Egan Bernal, already in the race leader’s pink jersey, would go on the attack, cresting the summit alone and going on to win the stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we didn’t see it, as horrendous weather made live coverage of the action from out on the course all but impossible.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/big-ride-passo-giau-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Passo Giau\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/big-ride-passo-giau-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/big-ride-passo-giau-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/big-ride-passo-giau-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/big-ride-passo-giau-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/big-ride-passo-giau-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/big-ride-passo-giau-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/big-ride-passo-giau-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/big-ride-passo-giau-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/big-ride-passo-giau-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We might never know what punishment the upper slopes of the Giau inflicted on Bernal and those trying to chase him down, but what we can do is head to the climb ourselves for a closer look, and that’s exactly what we have done in the March 2025 issue of <em>Cyclist</em> magazine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Big Ride takes in not only the Giau, but the neighbouring Passo Falzarego too, and unlike at the Giro in 2021 we showcase the visual splendour of both stunning climbs in all their glory.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/pidcock-160-promo-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/pidcock-160-promo-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/pidcock-160-promo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/pidcock-160-promo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/pidcock-160-promo-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/pidcock-160-promo-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/pidcock-160-promo-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/pidcock-160-promo-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/pidcock-160-promo-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/pidcock-160-promo.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>One man that knows all about winning big stages on famous climbs is Tom Pidcock. Who can forget his solo win on Alpe d’Huez in the 2022 Tour de France, a victory that felt every bit like the arrival of Britain’s next cycling superstar? Yet while the two years since then have hardly been a failure – Pidcock has won Strade Bianche and Amstel Gold and is an Olympic gold medallist in cyclocross, let’s not forget – there’s an undeniable sense that things haven’t quite gone to plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the March issue we sit down with the man himself as he candidly shares his perspective on his career to date, how he’s been portrayed in the media and his goals for 2025 with new team Q36.5.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/nature-is-bike-160-promo-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/nature-is-bike-160-promo-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/nature-is-bike-160-promo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/nature-is-bike-160-promo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/nature-is-bike-160-promo-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/nature-is-bike-160-promo-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/nature-is-bike-160-promo-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/nature-is-bike-160-promo-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/nature-is-bike-160-promo-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/nature-is-bike-160-promo.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Then it’s off to China for a behind-the-scenes look at the Tour of Guangxi, the latest addition to the WorldTour calendar and a race that is as ambitious as it is unique. And speaking of unique, the Nature is Bike festival in western France’s Loire Valley certainly fits that bill. Bidding to be cycling’s equivalent of Glastonbury, this two-day celebration of all things gravel includes a range of rides that cater for all abilities, together with live entertainment, music and a bike exhibition. We signed up for the final-day Gravel 100 sportive to join in on the fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other highlights in the March 2025 issue include an in-depth look at extra-wide road tyres, a deep dive into the world of on-bike aero monitors and a factory visit to Spanish kit supplier Gobik.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s plenty more to enjoy in the latest issue too, so pick up your copy on newsstands or <a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-160\" target=\"_blank\">at the Cyclist Shop</a> or <a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscribe\" target=\"_blank\">get a <em>Cyclist</em> magazine subscription</a> to have every issue delivered free, straight to your door.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+5\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-5-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There are three levels of <em>Cyclist </em>subscriptions available.
