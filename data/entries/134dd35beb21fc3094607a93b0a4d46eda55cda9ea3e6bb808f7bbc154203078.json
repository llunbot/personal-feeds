You've probably got stuff going on, so let's jump into another roundup of the best tech deals we can find from across the web.</p>\n<p>With each passing year, \"Black Friday\" becomes more and more like \"Black November.\" What used to be a single weekend of sales has increasingly stretched out to weeks of breathless promotions. Much to the dismay of the Dealmaster's work-life balance, this trend is not stopping any time soon. So, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/10/the-12-best-deals-from-amazons-early-black-friday-event/\" target=\"_blank\">right on cue</a>, retailers <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3CASwL1\" target=\"_blank\">such as Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cfUCwo4B5rJ\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy have already started</a> to roll out so-called \"early Black Friday\" events that promise to offer the same discounts that'll be available at the end of the month.</p>\n<p>For today's roundup, the Dealmaster has pored through the most recent of these promos to find the discounts that might actually hold true to Black Friday's claims. To be clear, we're positive there will be a much wider range of good tech deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday proper than there are in the sales going on as of this writing. The majority of what's out there today is advertising hype (that is, even more than usual), and there's still a chance that some of the prices below fall a few bucks lower in the coming weeks. That said, the number of genuinely noteworthy sales within these early Black Friday events appear to have picked up since our last roundup.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808515#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808515&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"134dd35beb21fc3094607a93b0a4d46eda55cda9ea3e6bb808f7bbc154203078","category":"Tech"}
