The ‌HomePod mini‌ is Apple's first compact smart speaker, offering high-quality audio, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> voice control, and smart home integration via <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPriced at $99, it stands in contrast to the full-size <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, which sells for $299 and is focused on delivering bigger, better sound thanks to more advanced audio hardware such as multiple tweeters and woofers. While both models share ‌Siri‌ integration and smart home capabilities, the ‌HomePod mini‌ is considerably smaller, powered by the Apple S5 chip, lacks spatial awareness, and comes in a wider range of color options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homepod-mini-vs-homepod/\">HomePod Mini vs. HomePod Buyer's Guide</a></li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn October 2021, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/new-homepod-mini-colors-now-available/\">introduced three new colors</a>—Blue, Yellow, and Orange—to its lineup, adding vibrancy to the previously monochrome options of Space Gray and White. audioOS 14.3, released shortly after its launch, added <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/28/homepod-mini-update-adds-18w-charger-support/\">support for 18W power adapters</a>. With audioOS 16.3, Apple activated previously undisclosed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/homepods-now-feature-temperature-humidity-sensor/\">temperature and humidity sensors</a> within the ‌HomePod mini‌. Although these sensors had been identified by teardowns shortly after launch, Apple waited to enable them alongside the release of the second-generation full-sized ‌HomePod‌. On July 15, 2024, Apple refreshed the ‌HomePod mini‌ yet again by discontinuing the Space Gray variant and replacing it with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/homepod-mini-midnight-color/\">Midnight color option</a> to match the full-size ‌HomePod‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite its age, the ‌HomePod mini‌ remains on sale with the same hardware it debuted with four years ago. However, Apple is believed to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/07/new-homepod-mini-and-high-end-homepod/\">working on</a> a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homepod-mini-2/\">second-generation version</a> that could debut <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/03/homepod-mini-2-shipping-next-year/\">in the near future</a>. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/13/homepod-mini-announced-4-years-ago/\">Apple Announced the HomePod Mini Four Years Ago Today</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announced-the-homepod-mini-four-years-ago-today.2439938/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0754b3111f3039caf2772035e790d29a36f48d1e7ff9b20c63d03fb0bb3f088e","category":"Apple"}
