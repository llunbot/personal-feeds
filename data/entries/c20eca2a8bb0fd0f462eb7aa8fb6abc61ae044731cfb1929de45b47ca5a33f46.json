As the chain runs across your cassette, chainrings, and rear derailleur pulleys, any contamination or lack of lubrication will gradually wear down the precisely machined teeth of these components, leading to noise, a reduction of efficiency, sloppy shifting, and eventually, a hefty replacement cost. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of the chain as the heart of your bike’s drivetrain. If it’s gunked up with contaminants, it’s not able to function efficiently, and performance suffers. Not only will you waste power overcoming more friction in your chain, but that friction will accelerate wear on all of your drivetrain components, which can combine to cost many hundreds of dollars to replace. By making a small investment in a quality chain lube, big gains in not only performance but bank account balances can be achieved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a dizzying number of chain lubes on the market, with wet lubes, dry lubes, and wax-based drip-on coatings all claiming to be the best. All these options can make it hard to figure out which is the best lube for your bike, riding style, and the conditions you encounter out on the road or trail. Additionally, there are very strong and widely varying opinions on what lubes are the best. Based on our experience, popularity, and independent test lab results, we gathered 14 of the best chain lubes on the market to test and compare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our top chain lube recommendations are listed below, followed by the best of the rest which we feel are all worthy of consideration as well.

for the 21st century and beyond, offering not only the best performance of any drip lubricant ever tested but also an environmentally safe formulation that includes no harmful additives and is plant-based. </p><p></p><p>During this test, we were impressed with how quiet the chain remained, especially in the absence of the additives that many other lubes include. When it was time to reapply (after multiple bike cleanings, by the way) we were further impressed with how clean the entire drivetrain was. Chainrings, cassette, derailleur pulleys and, of course, the chain itself were virtually spotless. This also has to do with the fact that we followed Effetto Mariposa’s advice about stripping the chain clean before the initial application, something that’s necessary to get good results from any wax-based chain lubricant. </p><p></p><p>Effetto Mariposa claims 600km, about 370 miles, per application of Flowerpower when riding on dry paved roads. Our test period for Flowerpower was extremely wet, so we’ll have to take them at their word there. We can confirm that Flowerpower held on effectively during wet test rides and only needed to be reapplied after 200km of wet conditions riding, which is still quite impressive. We’d expect to go much further between reapplications in dry conditions.</p><p></p><p>When everything in the bike industry seems to be getting crazy expensive, we appreciate Effetto Mariposa ensuring that each container of Flowerpower exceeds 50% wax-to-water ratio, which means that compared to some other brands, you’re getting as much as 20% more lubricant per ounce of volume. And, even if you only get half of their claimed distance between reapplications, a bottle still lasts a long time.</p><p></p><p>On top of that, the independent test lab, Zero Friction Cycling, has tested Flowerpower and honored it as the best drip wax chain lubricant available for its wear rate and contamination resistance. It’s moderately expensive but not astronomically priced, won’t hurt the planet, and isn’t a just bottle of mainly water claiming to be chain lube.

The dried, or cured lubricant forms a shield against contaminants that would otherwise cling to the surfaces of the chain rollers and accelerate the wear that eventually kills every chain. With Squirt, and many other wax-based lubricants, this wear is significantly delayed, allowing chains used in dry, and less dusty environments to last a long time. </p><p></p><p>With Squirt, it’s important that the chain, even if brand new, is completely cleaned beforehand, ideally by submersion in a degreaser. This deep cleaning will open up all the nooks and crannies of the chain so that the wax can penetrate and coat all surfaces and then cure to provide a waterproof barrier against contamination and the premature chain wear it brings on. If Squirt is applied to a less-than-perfectly clean chain, it will still work well but will collect more grime and need to be reapplied more frequently to keep the chain humming nicely. </p><p></p><p>Squirt is an efficient lubricant, meaning that it spreads out easily across a fully cleaned chain, and keeps it running smooth and quiet for a better-than-average interval. The result is that a 4 oz bottle can easily last 10,000 km of road riding in mostly dry conditions. Better yet, a new and perfectly clean chain lubricated with Squirt may also reach 10,000 km before it reaches the .5mm of wear between rollers which indicates that the chain should be replaced. </p><p></p><p>Some riders note that using wax-based chain lubes like Squirt results in more chain noise than oil-based lubricants. While we agree with this premise broadly speaking, Squirt is one of the best options available for noise reduction among the cohort of wax-based drip lubricants. We also would rather have a chain lube that helps our chain last longer, saves our chainrings and cassette, and is clean to the touch than a lube that makes our chain silent for a while. </p><p></p><p>At $3.75 per ounce, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsquirt-lube-chain-lube\">Squirt Long Lasting Chain Lube</a> competes well with other drip-on wax lubricants that sell at double the cost. It helps the chain last longer, keeps it quieter than many other wax-based options, and provided that the chain is prepped correctly, ensures a buttery-smooth operation of the drivetrain. Just be advised that it can separate if it is allowed to freeze.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsquirt-lube-chain-lube\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ANNR15G/?tag=brbggearbikingchainlube-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tRunner-Up Best Drip Wax Chain Lube\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fceramicspeed-ufo-drip-all-conditions-chain-lubricant-100ml-112160%2Fp1490109%3Fv%3D1490088\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCeramicSpeed UFO Drip All Conditions\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$24.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>100ml (3.38 oz)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Price Per Ounce</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$7.10</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Wax</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Composition</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Non-toxic and biodegradable wax-based formula</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Recommended Use</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>All Conditions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CeramicSpeed-UFO-Drip-All-Conditions.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"2232\" height=\"1488\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CeramicSpeed-UFO-Drip-All-Conditions.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Chain Lubes of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CeramicSpeed-UFO-Drip-All-Conditions.jpeg 2232w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CeramicSpeed-UFO-Drip-All-Conditions-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CeramicSpeed-UFO-Drip-All-Conditions-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CeramicSpeed-UFO-Drip-All-Conditions-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CeramicSpeed-UFO-Drip-All-Conditions-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CeramicSpeed-UFO-Drip-All-Conditions-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CeramicSpeed-UFO-Drip-All-Conditions-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CeramicSpeed-UFO-Drip-All-Conditions-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Runs quiet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Hangs tough in wet conditions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Long-lasting</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Extensive chain prep required</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fceramicspeed-ufo-drip-all-conditions-chain-lubricant-100ml-112160%2Fp1490109%3Fv%3D1490088\">Ceramic Speed UFO Drip All-Conditions</a> is a wax-based liquid chain coating that goes on wet from the bottle, then bonds to the chain’s internals, creating exceptional lubrication, reducing friction for better performance, and protecting the drivetrain from premature wear. Ceramic Speed also claims that UFO will last 300km per application (in dry conditions), a promise which we were keen to put to the test. </p><p></p><p>First though, came the chain prep required for UFO and all wax-based lubes of its kind. Preferably, switching to UFO coincides with replacing the chain, but even if the chain is fresh out of the box, you’ll want to have it cleaned such that all the factory coating is removed. This is critical because UFO is designed to slowly penetrate and spread all throughout the chain, and it won’t be able to do that with contamination or factory grease in its way. </p><p></p><p>With the release of the newly updated UFO drip lube, Ceramic Speed changed the application instructions to a method that sounds like it will induce folks to use up a bottle more quickly. We stuck with the tried and true method of simply applying a generous dollop to every chain roller, then backpedaling the chain to help it work its way in. The white color stands out and helps identify any rollers that were missed along the way. We let the chain sit overnight so that the UFO coating could cure completely and then went out into the toughest conditions for a chain lube – a group road ride on wet roads with nary a fender to be found. </p><p></p><p>While we didn’t do 300km that day, we did hit triple digits and came away impressed with how smooth and quiet the chain was throughout the ride. After cleaning the bike off with a hose, cleaning wipes, and another hose rinse, the chain was virtually spotless and still ran nearly silent. Given the amount of road grime and water the chain was exposed to on that ride and subsequent cleaning, we are convinced that Ceramic Speed’s claim of 300km is fairly reliable. Of course, results will vary based on many factors specific to each rider, but it’s nice to know that a chain coating that costs $7.10 per ounce is tough enough to hold onto the chain through some nasty riding conditions. </p><p></p><p>The new, updated formula of <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fceramicspeed-ufo-drip-all-conditions-chain-lubricant-100ml-112160%2Fp1490109%3Fv%3D1490088\">UFO Drip All-Conditions from Ceramic Speed</a> is non-toxic and biodegradable, meaning it’s a better choice for your health and the planet. At $24 for 100ml, it’s certainly not cheap, but considering that a little goes a long way, literally, and that wax-based coatings can extend the life of drivetrains significantly, we see UFO drip more as an investment than a splurge. Along with updated packing, UFO Drip also now comes in <a

ultra-premium wax-based drip chain lube that utilizes graphene nanoparticles, making it highly effective in all the ways that wax-based lubricants should be. It’s clean, quiet, efficient, and I’ll whisper it again….quiet. It’s essentially the drip equivalent of Absolute Black’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/absoluteblack-graphenwax-chain-lube-sheds-friction-with-less-mess-stress/\">immersive GraphenWax</a>, in a form that’s much easier to use.</p><p></p><p>According to absoluteBLACK: “Graphene – the wonder material that is still not commonly used because of its incredibly high cost, is a great additive for a few reasons. It has an extremely low friction coefficient in all environments, is far stronger than any known material…and can cling to metal, protecting friction surfaces from excessive abrasion. Moreover, it repels the water and is not permeable to air reducing therefore oxidative stress on the metal surface. Even a single atom layer is enough to reduce the friction considerably.”</p><p></p><p>absoluteBLACK GraphenLube absolutely must be applied to a new and fully stripped clean chain. It’s not that it won’t work otherwise, but rather it would simply be a bit of a waste of this magical potion to apply it to a contaminated or factory-greased chain. And, at over $40/oz, it’s not a lubricant you want to spray about carelessly. </p><p></p><p>What separates GraphenLube from other lubes, even other wax-based lubes that incorporate graphene, is the noise and chatter reduction absoluteBLACK achieves. Even fully cross-chained and chopping away out of the saddle to crest a roller, the chain felt serene, quiet, and in harmony with the cassette and chainrings.

For riders who want the best lubricant that can be dripped on during a pre-ride bike check and reapplied whenever and wherever, Silca offers its brilliant and oil-based <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsilca-synergetic-chain-lube\">Synergetic Wet Lube</a>.</p><p></p><p>Traditional oil-based “wet” chain lubes are great at keeping the chain quiet and shifting smoothly, but the oil-based compositions also attract and absorb dust and dirt particles, eventually forming a grinding paste that can drastically accelerate the wear of not only the chain itself but also cassettes and chainrings. None of these items are inexpensive to replace. </p><p></p><p>The independent chain lube tester, Zero Friction Cycling, found that Silca Synergetic Wet Lube was the only wet lubricant ever tested which produced zero chain wear in preliminary rounds of testing. What this means in the real world is that if Synergetic is applied every 500 miles and ridden in favorable conditions like dry weather on clean pavement, you can expect to increase the service life of your drivetrain components by a significant margin over other wet lubes. </p><p></p><p>If ridden in wet conditions on grimey, or even unpaved roads, Synergetic is a great performer, keeping the chain quiet and shifting smoothly for many hours, and its ability to protect the drivetrain remains stronger relative to other wet lubes used under similar conditions. According to Silca, because Synergetic Wet Lube “forms a durable <em>Tribofilm</em> at the metal surface, and is strongly attracted to itself, the lube proves to be exceptionally waterproof, remaining inside the chain even in testing under full water submersion.”</p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsilca-synergetic-chain-lube\">Silca Synergetic Wet Lube</a> is a wonderful option for riders who are not interested in the lengthy process of applying wax-based chain lubricants, but who are conscious of drivetrain wear and the costs that it incurs, and also want to maximize the efficiency of their drivetrain and, along with it, their speed while riding. At $25 for 2 oz, Synergetic sits at the premium end of oil-based lubricants. Still, it’s important to note that thanks to its fine applicator, Synergetic coats very well with just a small amount from the bottle, and once applied, extends the life of drivetrain components, making it a great investment to make in your bike. </p><p></p><p>More info in our coverage of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-synergetic-wet-lube-promises-to-redefine-how-fast-chain-oil-can-be/\">launch of Silca Synergetic Wet Lube</a>.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsilca-synergetic-chain-lube\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NN9ZWK1/?tag=brbggearbikingchainlube-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Value Wet Chain Lube\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B2307ES/?tag=brbggearbikingchainlube-20\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWD-40 Specialist Bike Wet Chain Lube\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$10</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>4 oz</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Price Per Ounce</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$2.50</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Oil</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Composition</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Proprietary oil-based formula</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Recommended Use</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Wet Weather</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WD-40-Specialist-Bike-Wet-Lube.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"2210\" height=\"1473\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WD-40-Specialist-Bike-Wet-Lube.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Chain Lubes of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WD-40-Specialist-Bike-Wet-Lube.jpeg 2210w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WD-40-Specialist-Bike-Wet-Lube-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WD-40-Specialist-Bike-Wet-Lube-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WD-40-Specialist-Bike-Wet-Lube-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WD-40-Specialist-Bike-Wet-Lube-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WD-40-Specialist-Bike-Wet-Lube-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WD-40-Specialist-Bike-Wet-Lube-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WD-40-Specialist-Bike-Wet-Lube-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Reasonable price</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Works well in wet, muddy conditions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy to apply</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not great for dry conditions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Needs frequent cleaning and reapplications – like most wet lubes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>While we wouldn’t recommend using traditional WD-40 as a chain lube, the brand has developed a line of chain lubes and cleaners that are certainly worthy of consideration.

It clings tenaciously to the chain in wet conditions helping your drivetrain remain quiet and spinning smoothly. The caveat is that like other wet lubes, it picks up a lot of grit and grime, so your chain needs to be cleaned frequently and re-lubed regularly. And, it’s certainly not ideal for riding in dry conditions as it will attract and cling to lots of dust. </p><p></p><p>While the details of the composition of WD-40’s Specialist Bike Wet Lube are scarce, the proprietary oil-based blend is “not hazardous” according to the safety data sheet.

Eventually, according to Wolf Tooth, WT-1 will penetrate completely into the chain’s internals, and displace all of the contaminants, allowing the chain to run smooth and silent while staying super clean. Perhaps the best part for many riders is that all these benefits come with zero chain prep required. </p><p></p><p>To test these claims, we applied it to a used chain that was well-contaminated from wet-weather commuting miles. The chain hadn’t been ridden, cleaned, or lubricated in a long time, so in the work stand, before the application of WT-1, it was squeaky and the shifting was sticky and slow. After applying WT-1 and wiping away the excess, we spun the drivetrain through about 30 cycles. The chain was immediately running more quietly with WT-1, which was no surprise. </p><p></p><p>What was surprising was the amount of sludge that quickly appeared on the surface of the chain riding the bike around later that day. While unsightly, this was WT-1 doing exactly what it’s designed to do, which is pushing out old contamination from deep within the chain. As we continued to ride and wipe away the newly-surfaced crud from the chain throughout the week, the chain and drivetrain became smooth, quiet, and eventually fairly clean in appearance. It was not “eat off it” clean like a dip waxed chain, but it was clear that the chain was no longer acting as an abrasive wear accelerator for the cassette and chainrings.</p><p></p><p>So, if you’re the type of rider who chuckles at the thought of spending 24 hours prepping your chain so you can apply a $50 lubricant, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fwolf-tooth-components-wt-1-chain-lube\">WT-1 Chain Lube</a> is probably a better option for you.

It’s also one of the cleanest running lubricants we tested, assuming it’s applied to a clean chain from the get-go. </p><p></p><p>Application is best done by holding the bottle above the chain as it passes over the top of the cassette and dripping it onto the chain while backpedaling the bike. Unlike many wax-based lubricants, Pedro’s Slick Wax is quick to penetrate the chain and creates a protective coating that reduces wear and noise. Keep in mind that although penetration is quick, Slick Wax, like other wax-based lubes, works best when given at least 12 hours to cure. </p><p></p><p>While it is intended for dry and dusty conditions, we were impressed by how clean Slick Wax kept our whole drivetrain during sloppy winter rides. Riding without fenders, and getting home with clothing and bike covered in road spray, we found that the chain, chainrings, and cassette were all virtually spotless. Slick Wax also hung tough through repeated bike washes and a week of riding in nasty conditions. Eventually, the chain began to whisper a bit, but a quick wipe down and reapplication of Slick Wax returned it to near silent and buttery smooth running.</p><p></p><p>Another detail we appreciated was the odorless nature of Slick Wax.

Super Secret contains Tungsten Disulphide, also known as WS2, which Silca calls the “most lubricious additive” available. Super Secret has been independently tested and verified to be nearly competitive with dip waxes in terms of friction losses and chain wear rates. In other words, it’s an easy-to-use lubricant that can help riders save a few watts (Silca claims up to 7w) and a few dollars by making the chain run smoother with less of the abrasion that leads to chain wear. </p><p></p><p>What sets Silca Super Secret apart from all other drip-on wax-based lubricants, such as Squirt, absoluteBLACK GraphenLube, and Ceramic Speed UFO Drip, is that Super Secret is able to immediately penetrate and spread throughout a perfectly clean chain. All the other lubricants mentioned can take longer to fully penetrate. Of course, this is contingent on the chain being perfectly clean, which is to say, brand new, and cleaned by submersion in mineral spirits. Still, you need to give it 12 hours to cure for maximum effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>So, while Super Secret drip lube is less work than a hot-melt wax, it’s not as simple as opening the bottle and dripping it onto the chain. While deep-cleaning the chain does sound like a lot of work, and yes, it is a bit of a faff, Silca offers an excellent step-by-step guide on chain prep and lubricant application <a href=\"https://silca.cc/pages/how-to-apply-chain-lube\">here</a>. Regardless, it’s an impressively effective drip-on chain coating that repels dirt, stays clean to the touch, helps reduce friction, and runs super quiet. It has also proven itself in Zero Friction Cycling’s independent testing as one of the best lubes available for dry conditions.</p><p></p><p>If $45 sounds outrageous for an 8 oz container of chain lube, keep in mind that the application intervals are quite lengthy, so a bottle goes a long way.

PTFE, which is the generic name for Teflon, reduces friction, albeit marginally. Other additives help Motorex Chainlube achieve excellent penetration and thereby help the chain articulate more freely around chainrings cassette cogs and derailleur pulleys for smooth shifting. </p><p></p><p>We found that Motorex worked brilliantly in dry conditions but required frequent reapplication to keep the chain running quietly. This is typical of dry lubes, as they are not all that viscous just a few hours after applying. However the benefit of dry lubes – Motorex Chain Lube being no exception – is that assuming the chain isn’t contaminated with dust or dirt, you can simply wipe the chain with a dry cloth and apply more chain lube, skipping the pre-cleaning associated with wet lube reapplication. </p><p></p><p>While it is expressly intended for dry conditions, we were impressed with the performance of Motorex in dry and wet conditions. When many dry chain lubes would have been compromised or completely washed off the chain, Motorex Chain Lube with PTFE held on for a couple of hours of riding in the rain, long enough to make it home before the dreaded squeaking of an under-lubed and abrasive chain was heard. </p><p></p><p>If you ride in dry conditions and want a reasonably priced, easy-to-apply chain lube with race-ready performance, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fmotorex-chain-lube-ptfe\">Motorex Chainlube with PTFE</a> is a good option to consider. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fmotorex-chain-lube-ptfe\">Check Price at Backcountry</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Frock-n-roll-gold-lube-16oz\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRock N’ Roll Gold\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$8</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>4 oz, also comes in 16 oz</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Price Per Ounce</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$2.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Oil</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Composition</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Oil-based</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Recommended use</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>All Conditions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Gold.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"2255\" height=\"1503\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Gold.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Chain Lubes of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Gold.jpeg 2255w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Gold-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Gold-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Gold-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Gold-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Gold-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Gold-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Gold-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Affordable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Repels dirt and dust</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Hangs tough on wet rides</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Needs time to cure</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Frock-n-roll-gold-lube-16oz\">Gold Chain Lube by Rock ‘N’ Roll</a> is an excellent lube for nasty winter conditions. According to Rock ‘N’ Roll, it coats the chain in a “wet membrane” that lubricates contact points and also blocks out contamination for long application intervals, and is intended for use on both mountain and road bikes. </p><p></p><p>Rock N’ Roll Gold is surprisingly tenacious and held up through a week of road riding in nasty conditions, about 200 miles in total, without any excessive noise, grime build-up, or need to be topped up. When we eventually heard the subtle rasp of a thirsty chain and pulled it off for a deep clean, we were impressed with how the contamination appeared to be suspended in the membrane of Gold, on the outer surface of the links, and how the chain was otherwise quite clean. </p><p></p><p>Like other Rock N’ Roll lubes, Gold separates easily and needs a good shake before applying, and it is relatively low viscosity. Application of Gold is best done by holding the bottle above the chain and cassette, and squeezing it gently out as you back-pedal the bike being sure to give it a good soaking. Cross-chaining the big chainring and biggest cassette cog helps expose more of the chain for quicker penetration into the links. Since it works as both a cleaner and lube, you’ll want to be sure to wipe the chain clean after the initial application and first ride to remove the contamination that comes to the surface. </p><p></p><p>While Rock ‘N’ Roll asserts that Gold can go on without any chain prep, we found that this didn’t work as well when other types of lubricant were already present in the chain. If that is the case, we recommend a deep clean prior to application. If a different type of Rock ‘N’ Roll has been used previously, however, there is no need to clean the chain. <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Frock-n-roll-gold-lube-16oz\">Rock N’ Roll Gold</a> also works best when given several hours to cure before riding. </p><p></p><p>At $8 for a 4-ounce bottle ($2 an ounce), Rock N’ Roll Gold is relatively affordable compared to most other competitors. That said, the thin nature of the lube and the soaking application recommended by Rock N’ Roll means that you’ll go through it a little quicker than many others.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Frock-n-roll-gold-lube-16oz\">Check Price at Backcountry</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Frock-n-roll-holy-cow-chain-lubrication-bottle-4oz-rn160%2Fp1367992%3Fv%3D618162\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRock N’ Roll Holy Cow\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$8.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>4 oz</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Price Per Ounce</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$2.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Wet lube</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Composition</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No information available</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Recommended use</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>All conditions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Holy-Cow.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Holy-Cow.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Chain Lubes of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Holy-Cow.jpeg 620w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Holy-Cow-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rock-N-Roll-Holy-Cow-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Stays fairly clean</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Affordable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Cleans and lubes in one</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Requires more frequent application than some</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Frock-n-roll-holy-cow-chain-lubrication-bottle-4oz-rn160%2Fp1367992%3Fv%3D618162\">Rock N’ Roll Holy Cow </a>Chain lube is formulated to offer the benefits of both wet and dry chain lubricants. This means that like most wet lubes, it will penetrate quickly and protect the chain in nasty conditions, but like a dry lube, it doesn’t pick up as much contamination as most wet lubes. Holy Cow is also intended to be an all-in-one lube and chain cleaner that will push out contaminants that are already hidden deep inside the chain. Its secret formula is not oil-based, but beyond that, composition details from Rock ‘N’ Roll are scant.  </p><p></p><p>Like other Rock N’ Roll products, Holy Cow requires vigorous shaking to mix before applying as the ingredients tend to separate relatively quickly. Look at the bottom of the bottle to ensure the active ingredients have detached and mixed into the rest of the liquid before dripping Holy Cow on your chain. It also comes out of the bottle very quickly due to its low viscosity, and Rock ‘N’ Roll recommends really soaking the chain by gently squeezing a continuous stream of lubricant over the chain as you backpedal that crankset, to help the lubricant spread evenly and penetrate the rollers of the chain. Letting Holy Cow cure overnight is ideal for achieving optimal results. </p><p></p><p>On the road, Holy Cow Chain Lube worked as expected to keep the chain running smoothly and quietly, but did require a reapplication after only 100 miles, which was a bit surprising. To its credit, Holy Cow did seem to help clean the chain and get pretty nasty initially, although a quick wipe down and reapplication brought it right back to life. Subsequent treatments, especially in drier conditions, proved to be longer lasting and did not attract lots of contaminants. </p><p></p><p>We are confident that with consistent and correct application, combined with occasional deep cleans of the chain, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Frock-n-roll-holy-cow-chain-lubrication-bottle-4oz-rn160%2Fp1367992%3Fv%3D618162\">Rock ‘N’ Roll Holy Cow</a> will provide a great ride experience and allow you to get more mileage from your drivetrain, by removing and deflecting contaminants. At just around $8 for a 4 oz bottle, Holy Cow’s reasonable price and solid performance make it a good value. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Frock-n-roll-holy-cow-chain-lubrication-bottle-4oz-rn160%2Fp1367992%3Fv%3D618162\">Check Price at Performance Bike</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001FYGGHQ/?tag=brbggearbikingchainlube-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fmaxima-chain-wax-parafilm-lube\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMaxima Chain Wax Parafilm Lube\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$11</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>4 oz</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Price Per Ounce</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$2.75</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Wax</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Composition</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Proprietary Parafilm Formula</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Recommended use</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>All conditions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Maxima-Chain-Wax-Parafilm-Lube.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"2140\" height=\"1427\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Maxima-Chain-Wax-Parafilm-Lube.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Chain Lubes of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Maxima-Chain-Wax-Parafilm-Lube.jpeg 2140w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Maxima-Chain-Wax-Parafilm-Lube-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Maxima-Chain-Wax-Parafilm-Lube-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Maxima-Chain-Wax-Parafilm-Lube-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Maxima-Chain-Wax-Parafilm-Lube-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Maxima-Chain-Wax-Parafilm-Lube-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Maxima-Chain-Wax-Parafilm-Lube-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Maxima-Chain-Wax-Parafilm-Lube-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Runs quiet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Inexpensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy-to-use applicator</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Strong scent</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Manufactured in Maxima’s Southern California factory, their <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fmaxima-chain-wax-parafilm-lube\">Chain Wax Lube</a> is an all-conditions lubricant that uses Parafilm, which goes on wet to quickly penetrate rollers and outer plates of the chain, and then quickly dries to protect these surfaces from grime and dust as they operate in contact with each other. Not only does Chain Wax protect well, but it also lubricates and keeps the chain super quiet right from the first application – something that not all wax-based chain lubes can deliver.</p><p></p><p>Parafilm is a semi-transparent, flexible film composed of a blend of waxes and polymers. It is highly malleable, which makes a great additive in chain lubricant, which must penetrate tiny gaps in the construction of the bike chain. Applying Maxima Chain Wax is easy, thanks to a long and fine applicator. This type of applicator makes it easy to precisely deposit lubricant only where you want and in the correct amount, to avoid waste and extend the life of the 4 oz bottle. </p><p></p><p>Maxima Chain Wax performed well in wet conditions which included a 10-mile stretch of hard-packed gravel. Although our chain was exposed to a lot of contaminants including dirt, and grimy road spray, it stayed clean and quiet throughout the ride. After cleaning the chain without removing it from the bike, and reapplying, we were able to ride for almost 150 km in dry weather before feeling any excessive stiction in the drivetrain and hearing the rasping of a chain that needed to be re-lubed. This is a respectable application interval for wax-based drip-on chain lube, so we recommend Maxima Wax Lube for riders who are on the road frequently and don’t want to reapply every ride.  </p><p></p><p>The only thing we weren’t huge fans of was the smell, which can charitably be described as a Cinnamon sent. We recommend wearing latex gloves when handling, applying, or cleaning off Maxima Chain Wax, as the scent is tough to get off of hands if they come in contact. Beyond that, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fmaxima-chain-wax-parafilm-lube\">Maxima Chain Wax Parafilm Lube</a> is inexpensive compared to many other competitors, easy to apply, and helps keep your drivetrain running quietly for a relatively long time between applications.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fmaxima-chain-wax-parafilm-lube\">Check Price at Backcountry</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F135421%2Fmuc-off-dry-lube-chain-lubricant-4-fl-oz\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMuc-Off Dry Weather Lube\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$12.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Volume</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>120ml (4.06 oz), also comes in 50ml</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Price Per Ounce</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$3.00</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Wax</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Composition</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Wax-based</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Recommended use</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Dry weather</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Dry-Lube.jpeg\">\n<img width=\"2217\" height=\"1478\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Dry-Lube.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Chain Lubes of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Dry-Lube.jpeg 2217w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Dry-Lube-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Dry-Lube-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Dry-Lube-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Dry-Lube-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Dry-Lube-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Dry-Lube-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Muc-Off-Dry-Lube-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Affordable</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Precise application</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Stays clean</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Needs frequent reapplication</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Muc Off designed their <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F135421%2Fmuc-off-dry-lube-chain-lubricant-4-fl-oz\">Dry Weather Lube</a> to perform in dry to slightly damp conditions. It’s wax-based and also biodegradable, which means that it won’t be able to cling to the chain well in steady rain, with road spray from both wheels assaulting the drivetrain. Even in perfectly dry conditions, we found that Muc Off Dry Lube didn’t keep our chain quiet for very long, despite solvent cleaning the chain prior to the first application, and letting the lube cure for 24 hours before riding. So, we only recommend Muc Off Dry Lube for a bike that sees dry weather and for a rider who likes to do routine maintenance like cleaning and lubricating the chain weekly, if not more often. </p><p></p><p>Thankfully, Muc Off provides a fine-tipped applicator on the bottle of Muc Off Dry, so that the lube only goes where it’s needed, and doesn’t end up getting over-applied and then wiped off the chain before it’s even penetrated the links. This easy and precise application helps prevent dust and dirt from finding errant lube and contaminating the chain. </p><p></p><p>Additionally, Muc-Off has stopped using PTFE across its entire range of products. So, while the previous version of this lube was not completely biodegradable, the latest version is. </p><p></p><p>Muc Off Dry also feels very light when riding. While it’s not the quietest of lubricants, it did give the chain fast-running and slick-shifting performance for about 70 miles on the road before needed to be topped off.

Ceramic Wet Weather Lube</a> is an oil-based wet lube with fluoro polymers and boron nitride additives that help it repel water and penetrate quickly into the chain, where it protects against wear and ensures silky smooth shifting in even the nastiest conditions including mud and constant rain. </p><p></p><p>While it works as advertised, it also builds up a significant amount of crud that needs to be cleaned quickly and thoroughly in order to ensure the chain and drivetrain stay free of buildup that can be left behind by contaminated wet lubes. It’s also important to never overapply Muc-Off Wet Lube, as any excess lube can mean more likely contamination and build up on the other parts of the drivetrain, such as chainrings, cassette, and rear derailleur pulleys. Thankfully, all Muc-Off lube bottles feature a precision applicator, so it’s easy to get the lube where you want it, the chain rollers, and nowhere else. Muc-Off even supplies a small flashlight with Wet Lube so you can easily see where the lube has coated the chain. </p><p></p><p>We tested Muc-Off Wet Lube for 3 days of rainy riding and even though the rides were rather short, we still needed to do a full degrease and reapply after each ride, due to the state of the chain. That said, during these sopping wet rides, the chain felt great, running smooth and quiet, with excellent shifting performance. </p><p></p><p>We recommend <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fmuc-off-c3-wet-ceramic-chain-lube\">Muc-Off C3 Ceramic Wet Lube</a> for rides in extremely wet conditions after which not only the chain, but also the cassette, chainrings, and rear derailleur pulleys will all receive a thorough cleaning. It’s not a lube for riders who like to just lubricate the chain, ride, and then top off when the chain gets noisy. At just $17 for 4 ounces, it’s easy to keep Muc Off Wet available for the worst conditions you’ll face. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a

Bikerumor, we ride all kinds of bikes, a lot, and we know there are few things more annoying than a squeaky chain or wearing out expensive drivetrain components prematurely. Of course, taking good care of and maintaining our drivetrains helps, but we’ve also learned that choosing the right chain lube can do wonders to keep things running smoothly, and quietly, and reduce the friction that causes our chains, chainrings, cassettes, and derailleur pulleys to ultimately wear out. We’re also in the business of reporting on and testing new products and technologies, and we strive to provide our readers with trustworthy and honest opinions of the products we review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our chain lube buyer’s guide, we tasked Bennett Shane with testing the vast majority of the 14 different products in this review and added a couple that are highly regarded by other members of our team. Bennett is an avid road cyclist who spends an inordinate amount of time riding for fun, fitness, and product testing purposes. He lives outside of Portland, Oregon where he encounters the full spectrum of riding conditions throughout the year. He has a small fleet of high-end road bikes and prefers it when they run quietly, smoothly, and efficiently while protecting his expensive drivetrain componentry from premature wear. Bennett has been testing a huge range of product categories over the past year, including <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-best-road-bike-tires/\">road bike tires</a>, cycling bib tights, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-winter-cycling-gloves/\">winter cycling gloves</a>, road bike helmets, and more. His years of riding experience combined with his testing experience have given him an excellent ability to tease out the often subtle differences between the products he tests, which is of particular importance for something like chain lube. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to note that we did not perform scientific friction or wear testing on the lubricants in this buyer’s guide. Since this type of analysis is quite difficult to perform and requires highly specialized equipment, we’ll leave that to the experts who already do that type of lab testing. <a href=\"https://zerofrictioncycling.com.au/lubetesting/\">Zero Friction Cycling</a> (ZFC) is one such resource that does independent laboratory testing of chain lubricants and publishes in-depth findings online. Much like Virgina tech’s independent helmet impact testing, we use ZFC’s findings to inform ourselves and help choose the products we tested. Our testing focuses more on using these products in the real world while examining factors like ease of application, drivetrain noise, contamination, cleanliness, and longevity when used in various weather conditions. To do that we gathered a diverse selection of 14 of the best chain lubes on the market to test and compare. Bennett Shane personally tested the vast majority of the chain lubes included here, and we added a few options that are favorites of our bike-obsessed editors, with the goal of highlighting the best options for every budget and riding condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chain-lube-testing-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Bennett Shane testing the best chain lubes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chain-lube-testing-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chain-lube-testing-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chain-lube-testing-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chain-lube-testing-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chain-lube-testing-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chain-lube-testing-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chain-lube-testing-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chain-lube-testing-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>Chain lube testing requires significant time spent riding.

We’ll cover some of the factors to consider in this buying advice article with more information provided in our FAQ section below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Types of Bike Chain Lube</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there are a dizzying number of chain lubes available, all claiming to be the best available, they can be broadly divided into three categories, wet, dry, and wax-based, one of which will likely suit your needs best for most of the season, if not all throughout it. Generally speaking, wet lubes are best for wet conditions, dry lubes are aimed at dry conditions, and most of the drip-on wax lubes we tested claim to be effective in all conditions unless otherwise stated. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wet-lube-conditions-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding through a puddle on a gravel bike in conditions that are best suited to a wet chain lube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wet-lube-conditions-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wet-lube-conditions-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wet-lube-conditions-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wet-lube-conditions-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wet-lube-conditions-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wet-lube-conditions-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wet-lube-conditions-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wet-lube-conditions-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>Wet, oil-based lubes are generally a good choice for conditions like these. (photo/Jim Graham)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wet</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Synthetic or oil-based “wet” lube, goes on thick and wet, and remains highly viscous, helping the chain run quiet and shift smoothly between gears. A benefit of many wet lubricants is that they repel water and stick tenaciously to the chain, making them a great choice for riding in wet conditions. The potential downside to this type of lube is that its oil-based composition remains wet and sticky which can attract contamination from dust and dirt that lingers in the air or gets sprayed up from wet roads. So, cleaning the chain and reapplying wet lube generally needs to be done more frequently to maintain its effectiveness. Examples include <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B2307ES/?tag=brbggearbikingchainlube-20\">WD-40 Specialist Bike Wet Lube</a>, Muc-Off C3 Ceramic Wet Weather Lube, and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsilca-synergetic-chain-lube\">Silca Synergetic Wet Lube</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dry-lube-conditions-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding a mountain bike on dry trails in conditions well suited to using a dry chain lube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dry-lube-conditions-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dry-lube-conditions-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dry-lube-conditions-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dry-lube-conditions-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dry-lube-conditions-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dry-lube-conditions-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dry-lube-conditions-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dry-lube-conditions-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>Dry conditions are where dry lubes work best given that they are less prone to collecting contaminants like dust and dirt. (photo/ Heather Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dry</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up are light and midweight “dry” lubes. While the term “dry lube” may sound strange, rest assured that these will not dry out your chain and cause it to squeak and slow you down. These lubrications are dry in the sense that they don’t attract and absorb contaminants the way wet lubes do. So, for arid, dry, and dusty conditions, they can keep your chain running more smoothly and save the components in your drivetrain from wearing out prematurely. Dry lubes are typically more susceptible to washing off in wet conditions, however, leaving your chain dangerously exposed to premature wear. We tested three lubes that are specifically intended for use in dry conditions including <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fpedros-slick-wax-bike-chain-lube-4oz-6290041%2Fp1367985%3Fv%3D561481\">Pedro’s Slick Wax</a>, Muc-Off Dry Weather Lube, and <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fmotorex-chain-lube-ptfe\">Motorex Chainlube with PTFE</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wax-lube-conditions-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding a road bike that is lubed with a wax-based drip-on chain lube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wax-lube-conditions-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wax-lube-conditions-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wax-lube-conditions-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wax-lube-conditions-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wax-lube-conditions-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wax-lube-conditions-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wax-lube-conditions-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wax-lube-conditions-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>Most wax-based drip-on lubes claim to be good for all conditions and are preferred by many high-performance, high-mileage riders for their ability to reduce the rate of wear on the drivetrain and their often long application intervals. (photo/Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wax</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wax-based chain lubes are actually more of a protective coating. These coatings cover the chain in liquid wax and then cure to the metal to create a barrier against friction and contamination. Traditionally, these wax chain coatings required full immersion of a perfectly clean and ideally brand-new chain in a crock pot full of searing hot wax. The process takes time and effort to complete and comes with a high initial cost, meaning that immersive wax is a growing but still niche style of chain maintenance that isn’t for everyone. Still, there are quite a few hot melt wax options like Molten Speed Wax, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-secret-chain-lube-gets-new-hot-melt-wax-option-no-crock-pot-required/\">Silca Secret Chain Blend Hot Melt Wax</a>, absoluteBlack’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/absoluteblack-graphenwax-chain-lube-sheds-friction-with-less-mess-stress/\">GraphenWax</a>, and others that are widely considered to be the gold standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1467\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image.jpeg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-297x218.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-800x587.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-120x88.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-768x563.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1536x1127.jpeg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Hot melt chain waxes, like Silca’s Secret Blend, have a loyal following for many reasons, but the process is a bit more involved than the drip-on alternatives.

The compositions of these drip lubes are similar to their immersive counterparts, so they promise a very high percentage of the same benefits in efficiency and protection against premature wear. They drip on just like wet and dry lube but still require the chain to be super clean in order to work effectively. Traditionally, they haven’t been the quietest lubes available, but some of the latest options are among the best in terms of drivetrain noise. Some of the drip-on wax-based lubes we tested at Effetto Mariposa Flowerpower, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fceramicspeed-ufo-drip-all-conditions-chain-lubricant-100ml-112160%2Fp1490109%3Fv%3D1490088\">Ceramic Speed UFO Drip</a>, Squirt Long Lasting, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fmaxima-chain-wax-parafilm-lube\">Maxima Chain Wax</a>, and absoluteBLACK GraphenLube.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Pre-waxed Chains</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1458\" height=\"1093\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1.jpeg 1458w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1-768x576.jpeg 768w\" /><figcaption>Kogel is one brand that sells pre-waxed chains so you don’t have to go through the hassle of deep-cleaning a brand-new chain yourself.

Most drip-on wax lubes need to be applied to a perfectly clean chain and allowed to cure for up to 12 hours to work best. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Application</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With all chain lubes, it’s best to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for application. This varies by the type of lube and often from brand to brand, but applying lube to a clean chain is almost always the best way to achieve optimal results. Many drip-on wax lubes specify that the chain must be perfectly clean before applying, so extensive cleaning must be done before the initial application. Even brand-new chains must be stripped of the factory coating so that the lube can effectively penetrate and lubricate the surfaces inside the rollers. Depending on the conditions you ride in and the amount of grime that gets stuck to the chain, subsequent applications may be as simple as wiping down the chain and reapplying, or as involved as a deep clean before reapplication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important fact to remember is that the rollers of the chain are the critical points to lubricate. The outer plates are simply linking the rollers together, and do not need to be lubricated in order for the chain to be efficient. Excess lubrication on the surface of the chain will usually result in faster build-up of contamination and less efficient performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Clean-drivetrain-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"A clean drivetrain on a road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Clean-drivetrain-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Clean-drivetrain-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Clean-drivetrain-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Clean-drivetrain-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Clean-drivetrain-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Clean-drivetrain-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Clean-drivetrain-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Clean-drivetrain-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>A clean and well-lubricated drivetrain is a happy drivetrain that’ll run smoother, quieter, and last longer. (photo/Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cleaning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whichever chain lube you choose to apply, it’s vital to also regularly clean the surface of the chain and occasionally deep clean it using a solvent or degreaser. This will remove contaminants that form an abrasive mess inside the chain internals over time. To clean the surface, it’s best to use a microfiber or course cotton cloth that pulls away surface junk before it infiltrates the chain. To remove that internal gunk, remove the chain and submerge it in a degreaser, or better yet in an ultrasonic cleaner. For a relatively deep clean without removing the chain, handheld chain scrubbers are a quick, easy, and effective option. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best time to clean a nasty chain is as quickly as possible after you finish your ride. Don’t wait until 15 minutes before your next ride, by which time the gunk and debris have solidified and are much more challenging to remove. Additionally, any reapplication of lubricant needs time to penetrate the chain rollers in order to be effective, so at a minimum, it needs to be done a few hours ahead of time in the case of oil-based wet lube, or 12 hours for wax-based lube. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/expensive-chain-lubes-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Silca Super Secret Chain lube and Silca Synergetic Wet Lube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/expensive-chain-lubes-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/expensive-chain-lubes-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/expensive-chain-lubes-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/expensive-chain-lubes-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/expensive-chain-lubes-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/expensive-chain-lubes-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/expensive-chain-lubes-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>While some modern chain lubes, like the Silca Super Secret Chain Coating and Synergetic Wet Lube, are relatively expensive, they can last a long time between reapplications while extending the life of your drivetrain components, which can save you money in the long term. (photo/Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Value</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping your drivetrain clean and lubricated can help improve your efficiency and reduce friction that can lead to premature wear of your (often expensive) drivetrain components. As such, the upfront cost of a quality lube can save you money in the long term by extending the life of your chain, chainrings, and cassette. Still, chain lubes vary quite dramatically in price from around $2 an ounce up to over $40 an ounce. It is absolutely fair to wonder what makes some lubes so much more expensive than others and if the added cost is worth it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there is most definitely some science backing up the friction reduction and watt savings of some high-end lubes, we’re still talking about marginal gains that are of most interest to super high-performance riders and racers. Most people will be just as well served by a lube that costs less and performs nearly as well. That said, many of the higher-end lubes also happen to be the longest lasting, meaning that some of the higher cost is offset by less frequent applications. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chain-lube-action-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding up a paved mountain road with a well lubed bike chain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chain-lube-action-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chain-lube-action-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chain-lube-action-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chain-lube-action-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chain-lube-action-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chain-lube-action-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chain-lube-action-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chain-lube-action-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /><figcaption>Choosing the right chain lube and properly maintaining your drivetrain can lead to many miles of carefree riding while focusing on nothing but the road (or trail) ahead.

It’s what makes your bike move forward, and every revolution of your pedals forces each chain link to click over hundreds of teeth on your chainring and cassette. You’re basically grinding metal on metal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the chain is dry, rusty, or coated with a layer of grime, it reluctantly creaks and grinds through each pedal stroke while the friction and contaminants slowly grind at the contact surfaces and cause all of the components, the chain, cassette, and chainring, to wear out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chain lube not only protects against corrosion, but it reduces friction to help keep that chain moving freely which can enhance efficiency and reduce the wear on your drivetrain. It helps to keep your drivetrain running smoothly and quietly and can extend the service life of all your drivetrain components.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>How often do I need to apply chain lube?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Unfortunately, the answer here is “it depends.” There are various factors at play including the conditions you ride in and the lube you use. If your chain is looking or feeling gritty, or you’re starting to hear it squeak, that’s a good indicator that it’s time to clean and re-lube your chain. This may come after a single muddy, wet ride, or it could come after several hundred miles of dry riding. Paying close attention to how your drivetrain looks, feels, and sounds will be the best way to determine when it’s time to reapply.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>How do I apply chain lube?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Most chain lubes won’t work well if you’re applying them incorrectly. Thankfully, it’s a pretty simple task, though it can be messy if you’re not careful. (Stay off white carpets while applying it.) There is some variability between types of lubes and brands, but most manufacturers provide recommendations to achieve the best results. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by cleaning and degreasing your chain (keep reading for tips on how to do that).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For oil-based lubes most experts recommend dripping a single drop of lube on each roller in the chain. Use the quick link as your starting and finishing point so you don’t do it twice! Let it sit for 30 seconds, then backpedal for 15-20 revolutions to allow the lube to sink in and penetrate the nooks and crannies of the chain. Once you’ve done that, take a clean rag and wipe down any excess lube before heading out the door. Don’t skip this step or you’ll instantly start to collect grime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For drip-on wax-based lubes, it is recommended to apply it to a perfectly clean and dry chain (for the initial application) and to give the lube time to “cure” for up to 12 hours. This takes a little more forethought than just squirting some lube on the chain minutes before you head out for a ride, but typically it’s easy enough to apply the lube the night before and let it sit overnight so that it has adequate time to penetrate the chain’s internals and form a hardened protective layer.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>Can I use chain lube as a cleaner or instead of a degreaser?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Often, people will skip the degreasing step and just lube the chain, counting on the lube and subsequent wipe-down to remove most of the built-up gunk. While this will quiet a chain, this is definitely not the best way to approach cleaning and lubing your drivetrain and may actually accelerate wear with more lube trapping more grit and contaminants. It does, however, depend on the type of lube you’re using, as a few brands claim that their products clean and lube the chain in one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with those all-in-one lubes, like those from Rock N’ Roll or the Wolf Tooth WT-1, we feel it’s always best to start with a super clean chain and go from there. They are intended to push contaminants out as you ride, so you’ll want to be sure to wipe those away frequently to remove them from the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since wax-based lubes don’t attract as much grit and tend to flake off a bit as you ride, you may only need to wipe down your chain unless you can feel grit trapped in there. In general, wax-based lubes don’t require as frequent of cleaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most oil-based lubes aren’t designed to clean your chain (with the exception of the Wolf Tooth WT-1 Synthetic mentioned above). In fact, it can just end up creating a sludge that acts like liquid sandpaper and wears down your entire drivetrain faster, costing you more in the long run. Not to mention getting all over your socks, legs, walls, car…everything.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>What’s the difference between wax and oil lube?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>The more common oil-based lubricants are classic because they’re easy to use, and in most cases, they keep a chain running quietly and smoothly. But unless you’re regularly cleaning and degreasing your chain, oil lubricants are dirt magnets, attracting dust and grit as you pedal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, some cyclists might have experience using actual wax, which provides the same smooth and quiet riding experience without as much grime. Originally, waxing a chain required a labor-intensive wax melting process (and the use of a slow-cooker or saucepan). While it was cumbersome, the results couldn’t be matched by oil-based lubricants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, new technology has allowed for the development of wax lubricants in liquid, drip-on form, making them as easy to apply as their oil-based counterparts but with the longevity and friction-reducing benefits of wax. So, with drip-on wax-based lubes like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09S3XQ8QX/?tag=brbggearbikingchainlube-20\">Effetto Mariposa Flowerpower</a>, Ceramic Speed UFO Drip, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsilca-super-secret-chain-lube\">Silca Super Secret</a>, and Squirt, you can get the best of both worlds.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>Is there a time I should choose oil over wax lube?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>If you’re riding inside on the trainer, you may want to stick to an oil-based lube. Wax sloughs off as it’s used, so you may end up with a carpet stained by “greasy” chunks of wax if you’re not careful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if your riding conditions are wet and sloppy, wet, oil-based lubes, especially those specifically designed for wet conditions, have traditionally been better to overcome the constant onslaught of rain, mud, slush, and grime. That said, in those conditions, you’ll want to be sure to clean your drivetrain and reapply lube more frequently.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>Why are some lubes labeled as biodegradable?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>It’s only in recent years that lube companies have shifted to looking for eco-friendly options. According to <a href=\"https://theecologist.org/2009/may/13/behind-label-chain-lube\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Ecologist</em></a>, many lubricants were made with environmentally unfriendly Teflon and petroleum distillates. More recently, many <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aasq-144-how-are-chain-lube-manufacturers-making-their-lubes-less-toxic/\">chain lube brands are striving to provide more environmentally friendly products</a> that still perform just as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about how you wash your bike, near a storm drain or on the grass in your backyard, or how your chain lube may get into the soil if you’re out on a long ride. It seems like a minor thing, but finding a chain lube that is biodegradable is just a small way to help reduce your carbon footprint (or tire tread in this instance).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the environment, chain lubes that don’t include toxic chemicals are also better for our health. Getting a lube on your hands that’s made from sunflower seeds like Effetto Mariposa Flowerpower, for example, is much less concerning than one that contains PTFEs or other forever chemicals. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>Why can’t I just use regular WD40?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Actual WD40 might seem like a substitute for chain lube since you use it to silence squeaky hinges or loosen tight bolts. But using WD40 as a lube on your chain is doing more harm than good: It acts as a degreaser, not a lubricant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use WD40 to clean your chain if you don’t have any Simple Green or your chain is so dirty that grease-fighting dish soap isn’t doing the trick, but we don’t recommend using it as a lubricant. (That said, the WD40 brand does make a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B2307ES/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\">chain lube</a> that we recommend above.)</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>Can I use the same chain lube on all my bikes?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Yes. Your choice of chain lube should be more condition-dependent rather than bike-dependent. If you’re heading out on a wet or muddy ride, opt for wet chain lube. (Those tend to be popular with cyclocrossers.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ride in the desert? You’ll want a dry or wax-based chain lube to avoid a buildup of grit. If you bounce between settings or weather conditions, look for an all-around chain lube, though be prepared for frequent cleaning and reapplication, especially after particularly dusty or wet rides.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>How do I switch from oil to wax-based lube?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>If you’re making the switch to a wax-based lubricant, the same rules as above apply: Clean and degrease your chain first. But it’s even more important when making this switch since the oil lube and wax lube won’t mix well together, so you want your chain to be completely oil and contaminant-free before making the transition. (Even if you’re starting with a new chain, clean and degrease it, since new chains come coated in heavy grease.)</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>Are those expensive chain lubes worth it?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Depends. Like most things in life, as you reach the upper echelons of performance, the price increases exponentially faster than the benefits. The gains in watts savings and friction reduction are real, but they are marginal enough that it probably doesn’t really for the vast majority of riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while the performance gains are subtle, there are other benefits: Longevity and silence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Silca, absoluteBLACK, and CeramicSpeed lubes are among the quietest we’ve used. When we’re cruising along and can’t hear or feel our drivetrain, we trick ourselves into feeling like it’s faster. So there’s that subliminal benefit, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re also some of the cleanest and longest-lasting. And some have ingredients that better protect the drivetrain, extending its lifespan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bottom line: Yes, they’re better, but maybe only worth the price if you’ve already optimized everything else.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>How do I properly clean my chain?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>The best and most thorough way to clean your chain is to remove it, soak it in degreaser or mineral spirits for an hour (or overnight), then spray it down with fresh degreaser and scrub all sides of it with a toothbrush. Then maybe some soap and water, rinse it and allow it to completely dry (like in a low-temp oven or direct sunlight).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this takes time, but if you’re prepping for a big event, complete overhaul, or switching to one of the premium chain lubes mentioned here, it’s worth the effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, chain cleaners like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F173827%2Fpark-tool-cg-24-chain-cleaning-system%3Fcm_mmc%3Daff_AL-_-5889-_-293233-_-NA%26avad%3D293233_f373290bd\">Park Tool Chain Gang</a> kit often get it “clean enough” without having to remove it. The kit comes with a cassette cleaning tool and degreaser, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re really time-crunched, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearbikingchainlube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F889595%2Ffinish-line-speed-degreaser\">Finish Line Speed Bicycle Chain Degreaser</a> works so well it’s scary. It literally blasts grease and dirt off your chain, leaving nothing but bare metal. The downsides are it’s not biodegradable (but is at least ozone-friendly), and that all that grease and grime ends up getting blasted onto whatever’s behind the chain…which can be your bike, garage floor, etc…make sure it doesn’t spray onto your disc brakes!</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>Should I degrease a new chain before installing it?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Here’s where it gets funny…most chain manufacturers will say no, that the stock grease is perfectly fine. Most chain lube brands will tell you that grease is too thick and a magnet for dust and dirt that also prevents lube from penetrating properly. We’d agree on the latter (third-party testing backs that up, too) and recommend using the cleaning method above to completely clean your chain first if you want to get the best possible performance from a lube.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>How can I extend the life of my chain?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Appropriate chain cleaning and lube reapplications will help elongate your chain’s lifespan. After every ride, give your chain and other drivetrain components a quick wipe-down to dry them off and remove buildup, especially if they got wet during your ride. This is even more important if you use a wet lube and ride in wet conditions frequently as mud, grit, and grime will get all over your chain. Consider the conditions you ride in, inspect your chain frequently, and clean and re-lube accordingly.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div><strong>How much is too much chain lube?</strong></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Many riders over-lube their chains. Generally, if there’s anything more than a light coating of chain lube on the outside of the chain, you’re just wasting lubricant, and risking it getting into other parts of the bike including the brake surfaces or rotors. Excess lube also ends up on the teeth of your cassette, chainrings, and derailleur pulleys. It becomes difficult to properly clean your drivetrain, collects dirt, and accelerates wear on your cassette and chainrings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid this by wiping excess lube from the chain after applying, ensuring that it’s nearly or entirely dry to the touch. Remember, generally speaking, you only need to apply lube to the rollers on the chain. Again, following the manufacturer’s recommendations is always a good idea.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n<div>\n\t<h2>Related Content</h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article>\n\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-bike-pump/\">\n\t\t<img width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Bike Pumps of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image.jpeg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bike-pumps-lead-image-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/buyers-guides/\">Buyers Guides</a></div>\n\n<h2>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-bike-pump/\">\n\t\tThe Best Bike Pumps of 2024\t</a>\n</h2>\n\n<div>\n\t<p>Whether you ride road, gravel, mountain, or electric bikes, a good floor pump is a must-have for every cyclist.
