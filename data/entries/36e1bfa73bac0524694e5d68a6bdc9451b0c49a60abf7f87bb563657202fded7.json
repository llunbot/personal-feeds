They joined forces to hunt down vintage bikes, and it wasn’t long before they’d amassed a stable of 35 of them in Voverka’s childhood bedroom. Then they started their own brand, Repete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I think the first bike we bought together was an old Francesco Moser Cromovelato,’ Voverka tells <em>Cyclist</em>. ‘It’s the one with the blue-tinted clear coat and it’s super-nice. We still have it today and it’s all original.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was about 22 when Robin and I first met, and Robin was even younger. We’ve been friends ever since. It started off with riding together, then collecting and renovating these old race bikes, which is where the love of steel started. It was a shared passion, and at some point we realised we wanted to make our own products.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Repete\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mikoláš Voverka (right) and Robin Fišer bonded over classic Italian bikes during a chance meeting on the streets of Prague, and now their creations have become hot property.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Founded in 2012, Repete has forged a reputation as one of the coolest independent bike brands on the scene. Its steel frames are simple and elegant, with tastefully subtle colour schemes (usually) and an Instagrammable aesthetic that has made them a staple in trendy high-end cycling boutiques around the continent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Honestly, I never thought I would end up doing this,’ says Voverka. ‘I’ve been riding bikes since I was a kid but nothing serious. And it was always mountain biking, never road cycling. Initially, I studied economics, but I ended up dropping out. I started looking for something in my life, and that’s where I found cycling.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/rizzo-cycles\">Meet the maker: Rubén Durán of Rizzo Cycles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/lord-cycles\">Meet the maker: Chris Lord of Lord Cycles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/alessandro-graser-cybro\">Meet the maker: Alessandro Graser of Cybro</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Repete\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-03-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-03-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-03-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>At Repete’s headquarters, Voverka focusses on the day-to-day operations, while Fišer concentrates on more of the design work. There are no investors pulling strings behind the scenes, and aside from an extra pair of hands in the workshop now and then, or a bit of outside help from experienced marketeers, it’s ultimately the team of two that builds the frames and runs the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Repete is all about making modern steel frames,’ says Voverka. ‘That has been the idea from the very beginning. We fell in love with steel, but we wanted to bring something new and innovative to it. Columbus started making the HSS tubing and it was a new thing at the time, so we decided to work with it to make our bikes.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Repete\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>When Repete started, the idea was to do everything custom. Frames were built to order and tubes were cut to the customers’ exact measurements. It worked for a while, but over time Voverka and Fišer decided it might be more beneficial to keep things simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We realised that sometimes we should be the ones telling people what we think is right, because sometimes people just don’t know and they need guidance. So we got to work on a new strategy, new frames, new branding, new everything, and came up with two models that are the way they are. That’s how we designed them. That’s how we think they work best.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Reason for riding</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>One of the two models is the Reason, shown here. It’s Repete’s road offering, made from Columbus Spirit HSS tubing and featuring the brand’s signature flat-mount stainless steel dropouts. The choice of components is a matter of discussion between Repete and the client, which in this case has resulted in the bike being kitted out with a Sram Red AXS groupset and CeramicSpeed oversized pulley wheel system. Rolling comes courtesy of a pair of Enve 45 Disc wheels, matched with Enve SES 29mm tyres and Enve finishing kit to tie it all together. But it’s the paint that makes this particular bike stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reason frames usually come in one of three colours, but for this collaboratively designed version an exception was made. It belongs to a friend of the brand named Lucáš. He owns a local bakery, Breadfit Store, which serves as something of a community hub for local cyclists.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Repete\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/meet-the-maker-repete-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘As soon as Lucáš found out about us he wanted a frame,’ says Voverka. ‘Through becoming friends, we learned that he knows a local artist, David Krňanský, and the decision was made to collaborate on this bike.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paintwork is inspired by Krňanský’s book, <em>Crisis Mag (LOL Life Society)</em>, which takes a sideways look at the current state of society. It’s a collection of motifs including smiley faces, words and simple geometric compositions, and it was Lucáš’s idea to apply some of these to the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘These small drawings and words were put on the frame randomly,’ says Voverka. ‘You can also see text on the chainstay that says ‘100,000 EUR’. Of course the bike isn’t really €100,000. We were just making fun of the whole thing.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repete is happy to discuss custom paint with clients, but don’t expect to get hold of a similar bike to this. ‘We made only one frame,’ says Voverka. ‘It’s not a limited-edition kind of thing that anyone can buy.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 145 of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/repete-cycles\">Meet the maker: Mikoláš Voverka of Repete</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"36e1bfa73bac0524694e5d68a6bdc9451b0c49a60abf7f87bb563657202fded7","category":"Cycling"}
