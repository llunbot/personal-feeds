It would ingrain in Jeter a demanding but\nmatter-of-fact standard, that a season is only successful if it\nends in a championship.</p>\n\n<p>Jeter’s fans loved him for that mentality, and more. […]</p>\n\n<p>He also learned to never make excuses, a lesson embedded in the\nYankee experience. With each passing championship, Jeter said,\nYogi Berra would remind him that he had won a record 10 as a\nplayer. It is tougher to win now, Jeter would protest, citing\nmodern playoff rounds, but Berra would cut him off.</p>\n\n<p>“His response was: ‘You can come over to my house and count the\nrings anytime you want,’” Jeter said. “So I always felt as though\nyou’re trying to chase something.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Billy Crystal: “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yankees/status/1435583084242538500\">Jeter, simply put, was a winner</a>.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/08/jeter-hof-shortstop\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"74a3d200235774f789c666d2a790bf42b034e751b348448396bbcc313251b8f0","category":"Tech"}
