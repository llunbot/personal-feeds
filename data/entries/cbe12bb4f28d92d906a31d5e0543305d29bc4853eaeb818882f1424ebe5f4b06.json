Today, the Singapore campus serves as a central hub for Apple in Asia, with a workforce of more than 3,600 contributing across all company functions including software, hardware, services, and customer support. The country is also home to three <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a> locations.\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"Singapore is truly a one-of-a-kind place, and we are proud of the connection we've built with this dynamic community of creators, learners, and dreamers,\" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. \"With our growing campus, Apple is writing a new chapter in our history here. Our Singapore teams have played an important role in enriching the lives of our customers â€” and we can't wait for many more decades of innovation to come.\"</blockquote>Apple says the investment will focus on upgrading two buildings next to Apple's existing facilities, integrating them into a unified campus that encourages collaboration among teams. This follows a decade of upgrades and expansion, including a 50% increase in the hardware technologies center since 2019. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe expanded campus will be powered entirely by renewable energy sources and aims for LEED Gold certification to align with its global commitment to sustainability, according to the company. Apple has been carbon neutral for its corporate operations since 2020 and has utilized 100% renewable energy since 2018. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nConstruction is expected to begin later this year. Apple says its presence supports over 60,000 jobs in Singapore through direct employment, its supply chain, and the iOS app economy, while the company collaborates with local educational institutions to foster innovation and technological development.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/singapore/\">Singapore</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/apple-invests-cash-singapore-campus-ai/\">Apple to Invest $250M+ in Singapore Campus to Expand AI Roles</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-invest-250m-in-singapore-campus-to-expand-ai-roles.2424415/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cbe12bb4f28d92d906a31d5e0543305d29bc4853eaeb818882f1424ebe5f4b06","category":"Apple"}
