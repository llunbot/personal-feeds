This year, the figure currently stands at about $400 million. Likewise, funding for renewals of existing grants without competition reached $4.5 billion by this time last year, but has only hit $2 billion this year. Together, this slowdown amounts to a 60 percent drop in grant support for a wide variety of researchâ€”from studies on cancer treatments, diabetes, and Alzheimer's to vaccines, mental health, transgender health, and more.</p>\n<p>The NIH is the primary source of funding for biomedical research in the US. NIH grants support more than 300,000 scientists at more than 2,500 universities, medical schools, and other research organizations across all 50 states.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/report-us-scientists-lost-3-billion-in-nih-grants-since-trump-took-office/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/report-us-scientists-lost-3-billion-in-nih-grants-since-trump-took-office/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b9995d21ebf446002fb7b606116519334e6230406fc4038a43b16b9eab56c651","category":"Tech"}
