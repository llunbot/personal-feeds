According to the filings, Microsoft approached Apple in 2009, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2020, proposing that Bing should replace Google as the default search engine in Safari.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple consistently declined these offers, citing concerns over Bing's search quality relative to Google's. The documents reveal that in 2018 Microsoft not only suggested making Bing the default search engine but also offered to sell Bing to Apple or establish a joint venture around the search engine. These proposals were similarly turned down by Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe court filings provide insight into Apple's decision-making process, highlighting the company's evaluation of Bing's capabilities against Google's. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/\">Eddy Cue</a>, Apple's Senior Vice President of Services, is quoted in the filings expressing skepticism about Bing's search quality and Microsoft's investment in search technology. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/25/google-apple-search-default-8-12-billion/\">Google pays billions of dollars</a> to remain the default search engine on Apple devices. Google argues that Microsoft's repeated pitches to Apple demonstrate the competitive nature of the search engine market, countering allegations that Google holds a monopoly in web search advertising. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bing/\">Bing</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/microsoft-begged-apple-to-adopt-bing/\">Microsoft Begged Apple to Adopt Bing as Safari's Default Search Engine</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-begged-apple-to-adopt-bing-as-safaris-default-search-engine.2420432/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6bc30d9d507986e81d4d44ead2d63dac8b3247d07584c96353f15fdba6b334a5","category":"Apple"}
