Powered by proven GebioMized saddle pressure mapping, the true innovation is just how easy Fizik has made the custom fitting process. Developed to be simple and fast, Fizik will measure you on your bike, then custom print a saddle to meet your specific support needs. It’s not cheap, but it’s also not that expensive – as little as 15% more than the cost of their previous top-tier Adaptive saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_me-getting-a-custom-saddle-fitting.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_me-getting-a-custom-saddle-fitting.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik One-To-One Adaptive custom 3D-printed carbon bicycle saddle, Cory's getting a custom saddle fitting\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_me-getting-a-custom-saddle-fitting.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_me-getting-a-custom-saddle-fitting-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_me-getting-a-custom-saddle-fitting-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_me-getting-a-custom-saddle-fitting-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_me-getting-a-custom-saddle-fitting-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(All photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We were intrigued.

/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Fizik when to the company that was already doing it on a smaller scale. German company GebioMized has been using their unique patented pressure mapping system for 20+ years to measure real live pressures between the cyclist &amp; saddle. A big part of that is used for refining rider position on the bike and matching the best existing saddle to the rider. I did a GebioMized pressure map fit 4 years ago, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-pressure-map-saddle-fitting-to-join-the-gebiomized-secret-saddle-club/\" target=\"_blank\">lowered peak pressure by 20%</a> – a real game changer. But I stuck with one of their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-gebiomized-sleak-145-riding-a-custom-fit-road-gravel-saddle/\" target=\"_blank\">stock saddle</a> shapes and padding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trouble is/was, it was a long fit process, and required about 90 minutes with a skilled bike fitter. Not a low-cost process, and easy to add at least $200+€ to the cost of a saddle. Still totally worth it in my mind for a committed cyclist, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>An interesting aside, Czech custom saddle maker <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/posedla-joyseat-3d-printed-custom-saddle/\" target=\"_blank\">Posedla</a> got around the complex data collection process with a much lower-tech solution to bring custom fit 3D-printed saddles to market two years ago, at a slightly lower price.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_wireless-app-based-pressure-measurement.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_wireless-app-based-pressure-measurement.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik One-To-One Adaptive custom 3D-printed carbon bicycle saddle, new Fizik+GebioMized pressure sensor mat\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_wireless-app-based-pressure-measurement.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_wireless-app-based-pressure-measurement-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_wireless-app-based-pressure-measurement-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_wireless-app-based-pressure-measurement-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_wireless-app-based-pressure-measurement-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_wireless-app-based-pressure-measurement-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_wireless-app-based-pressure-measurement-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But, Fizik worked with GebioMized and their pressure sensor tech to make the process faster and easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>One-on-One, step-by-step</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_fit-to-multiple-riding-positions.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_fit-to-multiple-riding-positions.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik One-To-One Adaptive custom 3D-printed carbon bicycle saddle, fit at multiple riding positions on the hoods\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_fit-to-multiple-riding-positions.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_fit-to-multiple-riding-positions-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_fit-to-multiple-riding-positions-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_fit-to-multiple-riding-positions-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_fit-to-multiple-riding-positions-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_fit-to-multiple-riding-positions-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fizik-One-To-One-Adaptive-custom-3D-printed-carbon-bicycle-saddle_fit-to-multiple-riding-positions-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Fizik worked with GebioMized to create a simple smartphone app-based setup that can collect rider pressure data quickly and get you on the right saddle for customization.
