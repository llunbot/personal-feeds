The Department of Justice is seeking a plethora of penalties, but perhaps none as severe as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/\">forcing Google to sell Chrome</a>. But who would buy it? An OpenAI executive says his employer would be interested.</p>\n<p>Among the DOJ's witnesses on the second day of the trial was Nick Turley, head of product for ChatGPT at OpenAI. He wasn't there to talk about Chrome exclusivelyâ€”the government's proposed remedies also include forcing Google to share its search index with competitors.</p>\n<p>OpenAI is in bed with Microsoft, but Bing's search data wasn't cutting it, Turley suggested (without naming Microsoft). \"We believe having multiple partners, and in particular Google's API, would enable us to provide a better product to users,\" OpenAI told Google in an email revealed at trial. However, Google turned OpenAI down because it believed the deal would harm its lead in search. The companies have no ongoing partnership today, but Turley noted that forcing Google to license its search data would restore competition.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/chatgpt-head-tells-court-openai-is-interested-in-buying-chrome/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/chatgpt-head-tells-court-openai-is-interested-in-buying-chrome/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"34d268b92d8cadee182db3ac9f53ac63144a4e8b59f77a4f35cb396412cda5ce","category":"Tech"}
