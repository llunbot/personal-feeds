It’s a simple part of your bicycle that is both elegant and purposeful, a real example of form <em>and</em> function sharing the same space. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ride crowded trails, as I do, it’s a must-have part of your cockpit, it’s essential. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1.png\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1-800x533.png\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1-800x533.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1-297x198.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1-120x80.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1-768x512.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1-720x480.png 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1.png 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>The Masi Incanto Dream Build</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in October, when I was building the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/masi-incanto-ti-allroad-gravel-dream-build/\" target=\"_blank\">Masi Incanto Dream Build</a> I reached out to Spurcycle for a bell that would be suitable for a “dream build”. The Spurcycle Orginal Bell was the only bell that I thought would be right for that build. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-in-box.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-in-box-800x800.jpeg\" alt=\"Spurcycle Original Bell review in box\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-in-box-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-in-box-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-in-box-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-in-box-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-in-box.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons they were the only bell company that I turned to, was that aesthetically it just made sense. Another is that I’ve currently got three of them on other bikes in my stable, with one of the bells being used for almost a decade. It’s been passed from bar to bar and still looks great and operates without issue. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Original Bell was Easy to Mount</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I love this bell and the way it mounts. Its design is clever and takes up very little real estate on your bars, being small and non-intrusive. It can be positioned any way you like to get a lower profile, the bell facing towards you or away from you, or you can rotate it to keep from interfering with handlebar bags.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-stainless-band-bigger-size.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\"

Now, rotate the bell to the position of choice on the bar and tighten.   </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spurcycle’s Original Bell in Use</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When activating the lever on the Spurcycle Original Bell you hear a pleasantly thin and distinctive “ring” almost “chime” like. At times it doesn’t sound like it would be loud enough to alert people of my arrival, and then at times it sounds very loud. Even when it sounds its loudest, it still doesn’t sound grating, piercing, or annoying like some bells. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-on-masi-hero-shot.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-on-masi-hero-shot-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Spurcycle Original Bell review on masi hero shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-on-masi-hero-shot-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-on-masi-hero-shot-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-on-masi-hero-shot-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-on-masi-hero-shot-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-on-masi-hero-shot-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-on-masi-hero-shot.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c.

And I’ve rolled up on hikers and other trail users who have complimented me on how pleasant the bell sounds, saying that “that’s a very natural sound” Or “thank you, that was pleasant”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It cuts through most earbuds as well, which is sometimes surprising, as the bell sometimes sounds very soft. But, right when I release the lever and it sounds like it’ll be too soft, the person with the earbuds jammed in their noggin, quickly moves to the right for me to pass. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find the Original Bell is a big part of a serene, successful, and drama-free ride on the crowded trails around my area. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, on the trails where I mostly ride my bikes, be it paved or off-road, a bell is an absolute must. It beats yelling “LEFT” at trail users all day, not to mention, it’s much easier on the ears… for both of us, I think other non-biking trail users appreciate and prefer cyclists use a bell. And this bell is the most non-intrusive, most successful bell I’ve used on a trail. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spurcycle Original Bells aren’t cheap, but they are made in the USA, and <a href=\"https://www.spurcycle.com/pages/faq#guaranteed\" target=\"_blank\">Guaranteed for Life</a>. The bell is serviceable and rebuildable, you can do that yourself with the available replacement parts, or you can reach out to Spurcycle for a “factory overhaul” to help your bell restore its original sparkle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d give it a 14 out of 10, and would absolutely recommend you get one for your bike…it’s worth the price.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have a few options to choose from when you visit the site. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Retail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Original Bells come in the either pure raw metal finish (like the one in the review here), or black DLC (Diamond Like Carbon) coating. They also use an anodized hammer (unless where noted).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spurcycle <a href=\"https://www.spurcycle.com/collections/all/products/better-bicycle-bell\" target=\"_blank\">Original Bell</a>: $59 (Raw color)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spurcycle Original Bell: $69 (<a href=\"https://www.spurcycle.com/collections/all/products/spurcycle-original-bell-blk?variant=42808808341682\" target=\"_blank\">Black</a>) with your choice of either a <a href=\"https://www.spurcycle.com/collections/all/products/spurcycle-original-bell-blk?variant=42808808374450\" target=\"_blank\">green</a> button or <a href=\"https://www.spurcycle.com/collections/all/products/spurcycle-original-bell-blk?variant=42808808407218\" target=\"_blank\">orange</a> button for the hammer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spurcycle <a href=\"https://www.spurcycle.com/collections/all/products/spurcycle-m2-compact-bell?variant=42812749414578\" target=\"_blank\">Compact Bell</a>: $32 (Black with either a <a href=\"https://www.spurcycle.com/collections/all/products/spurcycle-m2-compact-bell?variant=42812749381810\" target=\"_blank\">Pacific Blue</a>, <a href=\"https://www.spurcycle.com/collections/all/products/spurcycle-m2-compact-bell?variant=42812749414578\" target=\"_blank\">Really Red</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.spurcycle.com/collections/all/products/spurcycle-m2-compact-bell?variant=42812749447346\" target=\"_blank\">Safety Orange</a> lever) *fixed sizes of either 22.2 or 31.8</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-frankenbell-boxes.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"712\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-frankenbell-boxes-800x712.jpeg\" alt=\"Spurcycle Original Bell review frankenbell boxes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-frankenbell-boxes-800x712.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-frankenbell-boxes-297x264.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-frankenbell-boxes-120x107.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-frankenbell-boxes-768x683.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Spurcycle-Original-Bell-review-frankenbell-boxes.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c.
