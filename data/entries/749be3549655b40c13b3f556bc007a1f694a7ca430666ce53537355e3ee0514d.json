A toaster oven was <em>just</em> a toaster oven. A scanner was only used for scanning documents. But now? It’s the 21st century! Everything is multi-functional, and thank god for that. An air fryer can now replace between 4-5 other appliances taking up valuable real estate in your cabinets and the iScanner App can replace your bulky dinosaur of a document scanner. With code SCAN, you can get <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-2092&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=iscanner-app-lifetime-subscription-25-05-08&amp;utm_term=SALE-297719\" target=\"_blank\">iScanner at its lowest price ever — just $24.99.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s be real, it’s 2025.

Is that once-a-year occasion really worth giving up valuable desk space in your too-small apartment? I don’t think so, but since FedEx is closing stores like crazy, you’re SOL if you need to scan something.
