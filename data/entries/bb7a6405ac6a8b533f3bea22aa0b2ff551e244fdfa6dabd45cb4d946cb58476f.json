Pixel owners have been grumbling about the feel of vibrations, which have been described as \"<a href=\"https://x.com/habeebpain/status/1897170883837579736\">springy</a>\" and \"<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j4ghij/march_drop_changed_typing_vibration/\">hollow</a>.\" Others say the haptics have gotten <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j3nzrf/haptics_became_stronger_after_march_update/\">distractingly harsh</a> in some places.</p>\n<p>Android devices have long trailed Apple when it comes to haptic feedback—the latter's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/09/iphone-7-teardowns-big-taptic-engine-intel-modems-waterproofing-and-more/\">Taptic Engine</a> generally puts other phones to shame with its power and precision. However, Google has made great progress with Pixel phones. It <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-haptic-design/\">occasionally gloats</a> about how much Pixel haptics have improved. It would seem that this attention to detail is not born out in the latest update, though.</p>\n<p>Some of this confusion may be down to the addition of notification cooldown, a feature that was previously only in the Android 16 beta. This opt-out feature aims to reduce the annoyance of receiving multiple notifications in quick succession. The first ping you get in a two-minute period will be normal, but if you get another within a few seconds, it will have lower volume and vibration intensity. It tapers off until notifications don't make any additional fuss. You can still find all those notifications in their usual home in the drop-down shade.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/bad-vibes-google-may-have-screwed-up-haptics-in-the-new-pixel-drop-update/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/bad-vibes-google-may-have-screwed-up-haptics-in-the-new-pixel-drop-update/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bb7a6405ac6a8b533f3bea22aa0b2ff551e244fdfa6dabd45cb4d946cb58476f","category":"Tech"}
