The power bank features a 20W USB-C PD port, which is also used to fast charge the power bank itself, and a built-in Apple Watch charger. When the USB-C port and Apple Watch charger are both in use, each can operate at up to 20W and 7.5W, respectively. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Apple Watch Series 7, ‌Apple Watch Series 8‌, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra</a> support fast-charging with compatible chargers. The BoostCharge Pro is MFi certified and able to charge the Apple Watch Series 7 and ‌Apple Watch Series 8‌ from 0% to 80% in around 45 minutes, and charge an ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌ from from 0% to 80% in an hour. Since the second-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> can charge via an Apple Watch charger, the power bank can also wirelessly charge the ‌AirPods Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe power bank includes a 12-inch USB-C cable.
