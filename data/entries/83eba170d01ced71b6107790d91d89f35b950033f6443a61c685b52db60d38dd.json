Madrone’s Missing Link kits are compatible with SRAM 12-speed Eagle (GX, X01, XX1), SRAM 11-speed (GX, X01, XX1), and SRAM Force 11-speed. Madrone offers parts and tools to replace the cage, links/pins, and shims to take the slop out of the mounting bolt along with a host of 3D-printed tools to assist in the job. If you aren’t into tinkering you can also mail your derailleur in for an <a href=\"https://madronecycles.com/pages/deciding-to-rebuild\" target=\"_blank\">assessment and rebuild</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Madrone Cyles Replacement Parts Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Missing Links for Sram AXS Eagle ($129 with tools, $99 without)</li>\n<li>Silver, mustard, or walnut anodized Missing Link colors available</li>\n<li>AXS Eagle Pins ($29)</li>\n<li>AXS Eagle Derailleur Cages ($49 or $74 w/pulleys)</li>\n<li>Super Shims ($6)</li>\n<li>Rebuild Service ($18 shipping deposit, $185 for rebuild with new links and Super Shims)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to the high investment cost of wireless derailleurs, Madrone Cycles decided to focus their attention on the higher end of SRAM’s AXS offerings. Extending the usability of these high-end electronic derailleurs also helps prevent e-waste. While initially focusing on higher price point models, Madrone has seen significant interest from cyclists wanting to rebuild “lower-end” cable-actuated derailleurs as well. While it would be sweet to have these kinds of parts and services for all sorts of derailleurs, the time and investment would simply be too much for such a small company. Instead, Madrone is focusing on developing its own derailleur, the <a href=\"https://madronecycles.com/pages/madrone-jab-derailleur\" target=\"_blank\">Jab</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-5.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-5.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-6.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-6.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Over the past few years, I have acquired a few SRAM AXS X01 derailleurs that have been passed around my various bikes. Over time I have noticed that I had to regularly micro-adjust the indexing of my derailleurs. After talking to Aaron of Madrone at MADE, I was very curious to try their rebuild kits for my aging robot derailleur. After about three years of hard use, my derailleur could use some attention.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Since this is Tinker Tantrums and I am a tinkerer who regularly has tantrums resulting from said tinkering, I elected to go the DIY route. Madrone ships all the hardware and most of the tools needed for the rebuild. The only tool I had to buy was a 5/32” punch for removing and installing the link pins. The 3D-printed fixtures are ingenious, designed to do exactly their singular purpose. I did have a minor issue with one of the tools cracking during use, but I was still able to finish my rebuild. I’ll note that Madrone offers a warranty on all 3D-printed tools, free of charge, no questions asked!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-9.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-9.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-12.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-12.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-12.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-12.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-10.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-10.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Once I had my derailleur off the bike and all the parts unboxed I made my way through the nearly <a href=\"https://madronecycles.com/pages/videos\" target=\"_blank\">hour-long, very detailed tutorial</a>. With the exception of the small crack in one of the tools, the whole process went off without a hitch. With the included tools and instructions, the rebuild process felt accessible for any reasonably experienced home mechanic. I replaced the links, and cage, as well as installed the super shims on my finely aged X01 mech. The pins on my mech were worn and slightly bent, but the o-rings on my mounting bolt were bad.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-14.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-14.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-14.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-14.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-13.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-13.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-13.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-13.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-15.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-15.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Deciding To Rebuild</h3>\n<p>Now that I’m done with the rebuild, I am left with a bunch of very specific tools that I’m hoping to use again to rebuild my other AXS derailleurs for a few more years of use. This begs the question: should you DIY or send it in? While I was able to perform the rebuild process, you can send your derailleur to Madrone for evaluation and service. If you’re more prone to tantrums than to tinkering, just send it in! If you love to tinker, then this is a fun and accessible way to tear down your derailleur to all of its bits and build it back up better than new.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-17.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>While seriously worn-out derailleurs could use a whole new set of pins, links, and cage, I believe all AXS derailleurs can benefit from Madrone’s $6 Super Shims. These washers and shims reduce the slop in the mounting bolt of AXS derailleurs. If you can’t afford a full rebuild, I recommend you at least snag a set of their <a href=\"https://madronecycles.com/products/super-shims\" target=\"_blank\">Super Shims.</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-21.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-21.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-21.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-21.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-18.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-18.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-18.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-18.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-20.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-20.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-20.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2025_Madrone_Cycles_AXS_rebuild-20.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Better Than New</h3>\n<p>The first ride after rebuilding with the Madrone parts made the derailleur feel like new. At that, it should be shifting better than new due to the Madrone parts having tighter tolerances than stock SRAM. The sloppy actuation and double-shifting issues of the past were gone. Unsurprisingly, the derailleur was revived and shifting crisper than ever!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/DSC_8489.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/DSC_8489.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/DSC_8489.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/DSC_8489.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/DSC_8494.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/DSC_8494.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/DSC_8494.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/DSC_8494.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/DSC_8492.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/DSC_8492.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/DSC_8492.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/DSC_8492.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Looking Toward the Future</h3>\n<p>With an ingenious approach to the right to repair, even in the limited scope of AXS derailleurs, Madrone Cycle has a cool thing going. The team is currently working on the <a href=\"https://madronecycles.com/pages/madrone-jab-derailleur\" target=\"_blank\">Jab derailleur</a> from the ground up. Channeling all their ethics about sustainability and ease of repair into their own CNC derailleur. I’m excited to see where this project goes for them. I’m personally looking forward to a friction-actuated Jab mounted to a UDH in the future!</p>\n<p><em>Are you a tinkerer who wants to throw less tantrums at the work bench?
