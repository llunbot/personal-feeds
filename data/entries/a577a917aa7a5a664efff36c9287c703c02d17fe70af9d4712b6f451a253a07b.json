They went on to say that manual wiping should occur “when your printer may be in the hand of any third party, such as when repairing, lending or disposing the printer.”</p>\n<p>Like many printers these days, those from Canon connect to networks over Wi-Fi. To do this, users must provide the SSID name, the password preventing unauthorized access to the network, and in some cases, additional information such as Wi-Fi network type, the local network IP address, the MAC address, and network profile.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958242#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958242&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a577a917aa7a5a664efff36c9287c703c02d17fe70af9d4712b6f451a253a07b","category":"Tech"}
