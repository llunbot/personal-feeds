Midjourney advocate Nick St. Pierre <a href=\"https://x.com/nickfloats/status/1765471291300045255?s=20\">tweeted</a> about the announcement, which came via Midjourney's official Discord channel.</p>\n\n<p>Prompts are the written instructions (like \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/stable-diffusion-turbo-xl-accelerates-image-synthesis-with-one-step-generation/\">a cat in a car</a> holding a can of a beer\") used by generative AI models such as Midjourney and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) to synthesize images. Having prompt and image pairs could potentially help the training or fine-tuning of a rival AI image generator model.</p>\n<p>Bot activity that took place around midnight on March 2 caused a 24-hour outage for the commercial image generator service. Midjourney <a href=\"https://x.com/nickfloats/status/1765484188717728190?s=20\">linked several paid accounts</a> with a Stability AI data team employee trying to \"grab prompt and image pairs.\" Midjourney then made a decision to ban all Stability AI employees from the service indefinitely. It also indicated a new policy: \"aggressive automation or taking down the service results in banning all employees of the responsible company.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009244#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009244&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"68eecdba484144e74fac9cf3cdb2a6fccc5b01257a28a3137439efb5646ba062","category":"Tech"}
