The vehicle will carry two pilots (CJ Sturckow and Kelly Latimer), company representative Beth Moses, and three private customers.</p>\n<p>The private astronauts are an interesting mix. They include the company's first paying customer, an 80-year-old named Jon Goodwin, who competed for Great Britain in the 1972 Munich Olympics as a canoeist. He is joined by Keisha Schahaff and Anastatia Mayers, a Caribbean mother-daughter duo whose tickets were purchased by the nonprofit Space for Humanity in order to broaden access to space.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959695#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959695&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"10bef65e012258ee520911a4647485934d52e9397d132c89443f61d5ccc4b39e","category":"Tech"}
