The event is unusual, as it will be held completely virtually with seemingly no in-person meetup at Apple Park. That hasn’t happened since the height of the COVID pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also unusual is the time. Apple events, virtual or not, usually happen around 10 a.m. Pacific Time, but this one is at 5 pm—8 p.m. on the East Coast. The evening time again leans into the Halloween theme. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/apple-scary-fast.gif?w=1200\" alt=\"apple scary fast gif\" width=\"1200\" height=\"806\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to expect at the Scary fast event</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to announce new Macs at this event, though some may not go on sale for a few weeks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says not to expect a new MacBook Air, but refreshes to the 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch MacBook Pro systems are likely. In addition, the 24-inch iMac has been on the market with its M1 chip, unchanged, since April 2021, so that’s expected to get an upgrade as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary change in all these Macs is expected to be M3-series processors. We don’t know if only the base M3 models will be available or if M3 Pro and Max systems will be part of the lineup. New MacBook Pro models typically feature only Pro and Max versions of M-series chips, but the 13-inch MacBook Pro has the base M2.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to watch the Scary fast event</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The event will stream virtually at 5 p.m. Pacific Time on October 30. You can watch on Apple’s site, on YouTube, and on the Apple TV app.</p>\n\nMac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7a2cb935d7bd05e392437938ffda9670e933a8da8b06d1353a68b2d3be62b233","category":"Apple"}
