Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>The Mercedes G-Wagon, a very capable off-roader typically purchased by people who never intend to take it anywhere near dirt, is getting an electric upgrade.</p>\n<p>Unveiled in Beverly Hills—the most fitting of locations—the 2025 G 580 with EQ Technology spun its way onto the scene. The all-electric G-Wagon sports a 116 kWh capacity battery pack, four motors (one for each wheel), and a new sound system to replace the gas motor, called the G-Roar. Sadly, there's no word on price, delivery date, or range. But on paper, its impressive specs make it better than the ICE version off-road.</p>\n<p>For serious off-roaders likely not residing in Beverly Hills, the luxury off-roader's four independent motors offer true torque vectoring and electronic differential locks. Each motor is coupled with a two-speed transmission for a reduced gear low range. The ideal use for this is rock crawling. In fact, there's an actual \"Rock\" crawling mode in the G 580. Mercedes is not playing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019623#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019623&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d1938407e5b609e91f3d5cbd7a1e865e5df8b994820d1967a28d12e8e4fef61a","category":"Tech"}
