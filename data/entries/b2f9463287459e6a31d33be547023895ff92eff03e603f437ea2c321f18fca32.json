If employees don’t upload proof of vaccination by then, they’ll be placed on paid administrative leave for 30 days and unpaid personal leave for six months after that. If they still haven’t shown proof of vaccination after seven months, they’ll be fired.</p>\n<p>“We expect that almost all roles at Google in the US will fall within the scope of the executive order,” the memo said. “Anyone entering a Google building must be fully vaccinated or have an approved accommodation that allows them to work or come onsite.”<span> </span></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1820893#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1820893&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b2f9463287459e6a31d33be547023895ff92eff03e603f437ea2c321f18fca32","category":"Tech"}
