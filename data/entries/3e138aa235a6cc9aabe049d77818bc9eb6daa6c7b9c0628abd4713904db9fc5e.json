M8g instances are ideal for applications such as application servers, microservices, gaming servers, mid-size data stores, and caching fleets.</p> \n<p>Now looking at some of the improvements that we have made available in both these instances. C8g and M8g instances offer larger instance sizes with up to three times more vCPUs (up to 48xl), three times the memory (up to 384GB for C8g and up to 768GB for M8g), 75 percent more memory bandwidth, and two times more L2 cache over equivalent 7g instances. This helps you to process larger amounts of data, scale up your workloads, improve time to results, and lower your total cost of ownership (TCO). These instances also offer up to 50 Gbps network bandwidth and up to 40 Gbps <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/\">Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS)</a> bandwidth compared to up to 30 Gbps network bandwidth and up to 20 Gbps Amazon EBS bandwidth on Graviton3-based instances. Similar to R8g instances, C8g and M8g instances offer two bare metal sizes (metal-24xl and metal-48xl). You can right size your instances and deploy workloads that benefit from direct access to physical resources.</p> \n<p>The specs for the C8g instances are as follows.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Instance size<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>vCPUs<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Memory (GiB)<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Network bandwidth (Gbps)<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>EBS bandwidth (Gbps)<br /> </strong></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c8g.medium</strong></td> \n   <td>1</td> \n   <td>2</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c8g.large</strong></td> \n   <td>2</td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c8g.xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c8g.2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>Up to 15</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c8g.4xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>Up to 15</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c8g.8xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>15</td> \n   <td>10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c8g.12xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>48</td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>22.5</td> \n   <td>15</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c8g.16xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>30</td> \n   <td>20</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c8g.24xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n   <td>30</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c8g.48xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>384</td> \n   <td>50</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c8g.metal-24xl</strong></td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n   <td>30</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c8g.metal-48xl</strong></td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>384</td> \n   <td>50</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>The specs for the M8g instances are as follows.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Instance size<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>vCPUs<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Memory (GiB)<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Network bandwidth (Gbps)<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>EBS bandwidth (Gbps)<br /> </strong></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m8g.medium</strong></td> \n   <td>1</td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m8g.large</strong></td> \n   <td>2</td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m8g.xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m8g.2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>Up to 15</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m8g.4xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>Up to 15</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m8g.8xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>15</td> \n   <td>10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m8g.12xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>48</td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>22.5</td> \n   <td>15</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m8g.16xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>256</td> \n   <td>30</td> \n   <td>20</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m8g.24xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>384</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n   <td>30</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m8g.48xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>768</td> \n   <td>50</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m8g.metal-24xl</strong></td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>384</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n   <td>30</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>m8g.metal-48xl</strong></td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>768</td> \n   <td>50</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p><span><strong>Good to know</strong></span></p> \n<ul> \n <li>AWS Graviton4 processors offer enhanced security with always-on memory encryption, dedicated caches for every vCPU, and support for pointer authentication.</li> \n <li>These instances are built on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/\">AWS Nitro System</a> which is a rich collection of building blocks that offloads many of the traditional virtualization functions to dedicated hardware and software.
