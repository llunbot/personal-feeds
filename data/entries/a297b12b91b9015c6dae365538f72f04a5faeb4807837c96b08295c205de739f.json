It’s a drop-bar titanium 36-inch wheel bike designed to ride like the other bikes in the Curve range. The builds will feature a new carbon fork and Curve’s 36” Coop Hoops, the brand’s new carbon rim wheel.</p>\n<p>Getting financial commitments from 20 riders will confirm there is sufficient interest to push forward with this awesome project and bring stunning titanium bikes to the tall people of the world. The early financial commitments will fund the costly final stages of development, which include producing a custom fork mold as well as lab testing the final rounds of prototype forks and frames.</p>\n<p>If Curve doesn’t secure commitments from 20 people by the FPOI (fist-pump of interest) date, Curve will refund the money to those who made commitments, cancel the project and quietly sob to itself for a few weeks or years.</p>\n<p><strong>Commitment Required:</strong> AUD5,000. Balance on delivery<br />\n<strong>FPOI (Fist Pump of Interest) Date:</strong> 21 March 2024, funds to be received by this date<br />\n<strong>Number of Commitments Needed to Proceed:</strong> 20<br />\n<strong>Latest Delivery Date:</strong> 21 March 2025<br />\n<strong>Full Price:</strong> AUD13,999 (including 10% Australian GST) for the Force AXS level build or AUD12,999 for the Rival AXS level build. This includes global delivery.
