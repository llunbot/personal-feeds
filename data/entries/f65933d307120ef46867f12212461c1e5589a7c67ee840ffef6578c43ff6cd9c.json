Users can disable their \"Last Seen\" status so that other contacts can't see when they were last online, but the setting's options are currently limited to \"Everyone,\" \"My Contacts,\" and \"Nobody.\" \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe latest change behind the scenes is said to be a privacy and security feature to prevent people you don't know and haven't communicated with from seeing your \"Last Seen\" status and online presence in the app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a response from WhatsApp support, people and businesses a user knows or has previously messaged are not affected by the change.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>To improve the privacy and security of our users, we're making it harder for people you don't know and haven't chatted with from seeing your last seen and online presence on WhatsApp. This will not change anything between you and your friends, family, and businesses who you know or have previously messaged.</blockquote>As WABetaInfo notes, if a user can't view the \"Last Seen\" of any contacts they've already chatted with, it's because they have turned off the visibility of their \"Last Seen\" status or they've adjusted it on a contact-by-contact basis, a feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/whatsapp-last-seen-hide-from-specific-contacts/\">currently available to some users on WhatsApp beta</a> that has yet to roll out globally.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/14/whatsapp-hides-last-seen-from-strangers/\">WhatsApp Now Hides Your 'Last Seen' Status From Strangers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-now-hides-your-last-seen-status-from-strangers.2327432/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PIs0VCV1tSY:_-kIntOmvfk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PIs0VCV1tSY:_-kIntOmvfk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f65933d307120ef46867f12212461c1e5589a7c67ee840ffef6578c43ff6cd9c","category":"Apple"}
