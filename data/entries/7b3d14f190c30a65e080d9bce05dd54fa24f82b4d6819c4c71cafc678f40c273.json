The big news is the pricing information, and you can see the Workspace pricing page is new, with every plan offering a \"Gemini add-on.\" Google's old AI-for-Business plan, \"Duet AI for Google Workspace,\" is dead, though it never really launched anyway.</p>\n<p>Google has <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/workspace/google-gemini-workspace/\">a blog post</a> explaining the changes. Google Workspace starts at $6 per user per month for the \"Starter\" package, and the AI \"Add-on,\" as Google is calling it, is an extra $20 monthly cost per user (all of these prices require an annual commitment). That is a massive price increase over the normal Workspace bill, but AI processing is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/so-far-ai-hasnt-been-profitable-for-big-tech/\">expensive</a>. Google says this business package will get you \"Help me write in <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/14206696\" target=\"_blank\">Docs</a> and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/13384326?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\" target=\"_blank\">Gmail</a>, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/14001183?sjid=12171235234182626214-NC\" target=\"_blank\">Enhanced Smart Fill in Sheets</a> and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/13635180\" target=\"_blank\">image generation in Slides</a>.\" It also includes the \"1.0 Ultra\" model for the Gemini chatbot—there's a full feature list <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/13623623?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=13853688&amp;sjid=16144286721130975500-NA\">here</a>. This $20 plan is subject to a usage limit for Gemini AI features of \"<a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/14130944#zippy=%2Chow-do-usage-limits-work\">1,000 times per month</a>.\"</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ebUFWGby60.png\"><img alt=\"The new Workspace pricing page, with a &quot;Gemini Add-On&quot; for every plan. \" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ebUFWGby60-980x676.png\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ebUFWGby60.png\">The new Workspace pricing page, with a \"Gemini Add-On\" for every plan. </a> (credit: Google)</p></div>\n<p>Gemini for Google Workspace represents a total rebrand of the AI business product and some amount of consistency across Google's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/google-upstages-itself-with-gemini-1-5-ai-launch-one-week-after-ultra-1-0/\">hard-to-follow</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/google-debuts-more-powerful-ultra-1-0-ai-model-in-rebranded-gemini-chatbot/\">constantly changing</a> AI branding. Duet AI never really launched to the general public. The product, announced in August, only ever had a \"Try\" link that led to a survey, and after filling it out, Google would presumably contact some businesses and allow them to pay for Duet AI. Gemini Business now has a checkout page, and any Workspace business customer can buy the product today with just a few clicks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005057#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005057&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7b3d14f190c30a65e080d9bce05dd54fa24f82b4d6819c4c71cafc678f40c273","category":"Tech"}
