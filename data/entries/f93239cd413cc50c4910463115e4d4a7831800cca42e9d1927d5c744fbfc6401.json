But piracy is ramping up, and it likely won't back down any time soon.</p>\n<p>That's the takeaway from a survey by Russian game development training platform <a href=\"https://www.school-xyz.com/\">School XYZ</a>, covering the whole country and all game formats. Sixty-nine percent of gamers surveyed said they'd played at least one pirated game copy in 2022, while 51 percent said they're pirating more games now than they did in 2021.</p>\n<p>Piracy as a whole may be up, but enthusiasm and motivations differ somewhat. Roughly 20 percent of those surveyed said they had pirated more than 10 games, and 27 percent had grabbed at least three in 2022. But 31 percent said they had pirated nothing, and nearly the same responded that they were opposed to piracy. And only 7 percent said they had not purchased anything through official channels, suggesting that 93 percent of surveyed Russian gamers, even admitted pirates, had bought at least something last year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955674#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955674&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f93239cd413cc50c4910463115e4d4a7831800cca42e9d1927d5c744fbfc6401","category":"Tech"}
