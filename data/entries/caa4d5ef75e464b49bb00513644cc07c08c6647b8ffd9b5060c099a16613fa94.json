In conjunction with the CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission), Shimano is announcing a “voluntary inspection and replacement recall notice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, the recall notice applies to Shimano Ultegra &amp; Dura Ace 11-speed road cranks manufactured before 2019, and sold as early as 2012. According to the CPSC, the recall includes 680,000 cranksets sold in the U.S. plus another 80,000 sold in Canada. There is no “recall” outside of the U.S. since that is handled by the CPSC, but Shimano does have an inspection and replacement program set up in each region around the world. Note that these numbers are the total number of cranks that exist within the production window that need to be inspected. Shimano expects the total number of cranksets that need to be replaced to be much lower. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CPSC also notes that there have been a surprisingly high number of failures noted before the recall was put into place – 4,519 to be exact. Fortunately, there have been relatively few injuries, but of the six reported injuries there have been “bone fractures, joint displacement, and lacerations.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For any consumer that might have an affected crankset, step one is identification. If your crankset is identified as part of the included production code range, there is an inspection process that includes listening for noise, inspecting for abnormalities, cracks, visual imperfections, or anything else that would signal the bonding could be separating. For those cranks that show signs of separation, they’ll be replaced at no charge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more details on the issue, check out the page from <a href=\"https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/information/customer-services/corrective-actions/11-speed-hollowtech-ii-crankset-recall-notice.html\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2023/Shimano-Recalls-Cranksets-for-Bicycles-Due-to-Crash-Hazard\" target=\"_blank\">CPSC</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Crank Identification and Inspection Process</strong> from Shimano</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 1 – Determine whether this notice applies to your crankset</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 1A – Identify the model number of your crankset</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The affected model numbers are DURA-ACE and ULTEGRA branded cranksets with the following model numbers: <strong>ULTEGRA FC-6800, FC-R8000 and DURA-ACE FC-9000, FC-R9100 and FC-R9100-P.</strong> The model numbers are stamped on the inside of the crank arm near the bottom of the arm (see yellow square in the] image below)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Does the model number on your crank arm match the model numbers above?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NO:</strong> The crank is not affected, and no further action is needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>YES: </strong>Proceed to STEP 1B.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 1B – Identify the production code stamped on your crank arm </strong>(blue box on the image below)</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Shimano-date-code.png\"><img width=\"213\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Shimano-date-code.png\" alt=\"Shimano crankset recall date code identification\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Shimano-date-code.png 213w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Shimano-date-code-91x120.png 91w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A production code is stamped on the inside of the crank arm near the bottom of the arm.
