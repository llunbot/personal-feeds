First on the docket is the inevitable death of Google Podcasts. We've been side-eying Google Podcasts ever since Google's <em>new </em>podcast platform,<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/youtube-podcasts-go-live-in-the-us-with-inclusion-in-youtube-music/\"> YouTube Podcasts</a>, launched in April. YouTube has been slowly consuming all of Google's media properties, and podcasts completes the trinity along with videos (both amateur and scripted Hollywood content) and music.</p>\n<p>Google does not need two podcast apps, so Google Podcasts must die. This was announced <em>on </em>the <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/podcast-destination-on-youtube-music/\">official YouTube blog</a>, if there was any question about the responsible party. Google Podcasts is getting shut down \"later in 2024,\" but before that, we'll see an expansion of YouTube podcasts, which is currently only available in the US. YouTube says its podcast platform (which is built into the YouTube Music app) will be out \"globally\" before the end of the year.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/12.jpg\"><img alt=\"The Google Podcasts app. \" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/12-980x786.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/12.jpg\">The Google Podcasts app. </a> (credit: Google)</p></div>\n<p>Google Podcasts was Google's third podcasting service, after the Google Reader-powered Google Listen (2009–2012) and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/02/google-play-music-podcasts-are-live-for-some-users/\">Google Play Music Podcasts</a> (2016–2020). Google Podcasts technically started in 2016 as a bizarre podcast player that was <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2016/04/20/google-app-podcasts/\">only accessible</a> via a mobile Google Search. Searching for a podcast in the Google app would show a play button next to episode search results, but there was no way to subscribe to a podcast. Android Google Podcasts finally got podcast-defining subscription support a whopping <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2018/03/19/google-android-app-podcast-update/\">two years later</a>, but you couldn't really call the service viable until <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/google-podcasts-is-finally-available-on-ios/\">an iOS app</a> finally launched in 2020.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971148#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971148&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"81c8b5093b5bfa4f65f640f0f4e366c2d5d6a8f479cedb166cae2bfb23be0a6f","category":"Tech"}
