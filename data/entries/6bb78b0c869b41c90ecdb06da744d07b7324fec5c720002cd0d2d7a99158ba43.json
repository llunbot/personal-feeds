Google announced in July that the service was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/google-is-winding-down-google-domains-by-selling-it-to-squarespace/\">getting shut down</a> and that it had struck a deal with Squarespace to sell off the existing customer base. Part of that transition process means winding down the existing Google Domains functionality. <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/09/16/google-domains-stopped-selling/\">9to5Google</a> was the first site to notice that you can no longer buy a domain through the service while it waits for the Google Grim Reaper to arrive.</p>\n<p>Google Domain's homepage has a notice explaining that this all apparently went down a few days ago, saying, \"<span>On September 7, 2023 Squarespace acquired all domain registrations and related customer accounts from Google Domains. Customers and domains will be transitioned over the next few months.</span>\" You can still manage existing domains on Google Domains, but that's it.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/floorp_b9yeqMBOO2.png\"><img alt=\"The Google Domains registration shutdown notice. \" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/floorp_b9yeqMBOO2-980x406.png\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/floorp_b9yeqMBOO2.png\">The Google Domains registration shutdown notice. </a> (credit: Google)</p></div>\n<p>Google Domains has been around since 2015 and spent seven of those years in \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/google-domains-is-out-of-beta-after-seven-years/\">beta</a>.\" The product <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/google-domains-is-out-of-beta-after-seven-years/\">exited beta status</a> in 2022, only to be killed about a year later. For a while, it was a great service, with a clean, easy-to-use interface that stood in contrast to many domain registrars, especially in the early days.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969005#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969005&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6bb78b0c869b41c90ecdb06da744d07b7324fec5c720002cd0d2d7a99158ba43","category":"Tech"}
