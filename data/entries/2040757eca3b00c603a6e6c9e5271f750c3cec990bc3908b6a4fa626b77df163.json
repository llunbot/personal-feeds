{"title":"Latest iOS 18.1 Beta Adds Sleep Apnea Alerts and Breathing Disturbance Readings","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/ios-18-1-beta-6-sleep-apnea/","date":1728323640000,"content":"With the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/apple-seeds-ios-18-1-beta-6/\">sixth beta of iOS 18.1</a> and the fourth beta of watchOS 11.1, Apple has finally added support for sleep apnea on iPhones that have been running the iOS 18.1 beta since before the Apple Watch Series 10 launched.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/sleep-apnea-detection-apple-watch.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nSleep apnea alerts were introduced with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/\">watchOS 11</a> on the Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch Series 9, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, but those running iOS 18.1 and watchOS 11.1 never got the ‌iOS 18‌ and ‌watchOS 11‌ updates that added the feature, which means it has been missing for many beta testers until now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you've been running the iOS 18.1 and watchOS 11.1 betas and haven't been able to use the sleep apnea alert feature, it will be available after updating. Note that this is only relevant to people who did not previously have sleep apnea available in the beta.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter updating, you will need to set up sleep apnea notifications, which can be done in the Health app. You will need to answer questions about your age and whether you've previously been diagnosed with sleep apnea in order to turn the feature on.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBefore you receive a sleep apnea notification if you have the feature, the Apple Watch will need to collect 10 days of Breathing Disturbance data.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/ios-18-1-beta-6-sleep-apnea/\">Latest iOS 18.1 Beta Adds Sleep Apnea Alerts and Breathing Disturbance Readings</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-ios-18-1-beta-adds-sleep-apnea-alerts-and-breathing-disturbance-readings.2439449/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2040757eca3b00c603a6e6c9e5271f750c3cec990bc3908b6a4fa626b77df163","category":"Apple"}
