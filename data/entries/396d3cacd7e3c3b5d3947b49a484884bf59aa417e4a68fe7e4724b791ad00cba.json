{"title":"Reuters: ‘EU’s Vestager Warns About Apple, Meta Fees, Disparaging Rival Products’","link":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/eus-vestager-warns-about-apple-meta-fees-disparaging-rival-products-2024-03-19/","date":1710898869000,"content":"\n<p>Foo Yun Chee, again reporting for Reuters, after an exclusive interview with Margarethe Vestager, EU commissioner and renowned user-experience designer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A new fee structure includes a core technology fee of 50 euro \ncents per user account per year that major app developers will \nhave to pay even if they do not use any of Apple’s payment \nservices, which has triggered criticism from rivals such as \nFortnite creator Epic Games.</p>\n\n<p>Vestager said the new fees have attracted her attention.</p>\n\n<p>“There are things that we take a keen interest in, for instance, \nif the new Apple fee structure will de facto not make it in any \nway attractive to use the benefits of the DMA. That kind of thing \nis what we will be investigating,” she told Reuters in an \ninterview.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are already several marketplaces that have announced plans to open: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/altstoreio/status/1750598337533747445\">AltStore</a>, <a href=\"https://macpaw.com/news/setapp-ios-beta-announcement\">Setapp</a>, <a href=\"https://mobivention.com/presse-en-2/mobivention-revolutionises-the-distribution-of-ios-apps-in-the-eu-with-an-authorised-alternative-app-marketplace/?lang=en\">Mobivention</a>, and of course Epic’s game store, to name four. So the CTF obviously isn’t making it “not in any way attractive to use the benefits of the DMA”. But whether this is Vestager’s code-speak for “<em>We’re going to declare the CTF non-compliant not because it violates the terms of the DMA but simply because we don’t like it</em>”, I don’t know.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/112120521055132578\">From a transcript of yesterday’s workshop</a> on Apple’s DMA compliance plans, the opening remarks from the EC included this gem: “The reason is that we want to achieve compliance with the spirit of the DMA not just with the letter.”</p>\n\n<p>That’s not how the rule of law works in the U.S.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Vestager expressed her reservations on Meta’s new fees. The \ncompany earlier on Tuesday said it has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-offers-cut-facebook-instagram-monthly-fees-599-euros-2024-03-19/\">offered to almost \nhalve</a> its monthly subscription fee for Facebook and Instagram \nto 5.99 euros from 9.99 euros but Austrian privacy activist Max \nSchrems said the issue is not about the level of the fee. </p>\n\n<p>“I think there are many different ways to monetize the services \nthat you provide. Because one thing are the very targeted \nadvertising that builds on data being consumed. Another way of \nshowing your advertising is to make that contextual,” she said. \n“So I think it’s important to continue the conversation with Meta \nand we will assess also finally, what is the next push in order \nfor them to be compliant with the DMA.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the EC wants to ban targeted advertising, they should pass a law banning targeted advertising. But they haven’t. Targeted advertising is legal in the EU; Meta simply has to offer users a reasonable opt-out. It seems like Vestager is hinting that the only acceptable opt-out — “spirit”-wise — is non-targeted advertising that generates only pennies on the dollar <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/112120521055132578\">compared to Meta’s incredibly lucrative targeted ads</a>. This is quite a message the EC is sending to businesses around the world.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Vestager also warned companies against discouraging users from \nswitching to rivals by disparaging them, saying this kind of \nbehaviour could trigger an investigation. Apple has said some of \nits changes could expose users to security risks. </p>\n\n<p>“I would think of it as unwise to say that the services are not \nsafe to use, because that has nothing to do with the DMA. The \nDMA is there to open the market for other service providers to \nget to you and how your service provider of your operating \nsystem, how they will make sure that it is safe is for them to \ndecide,” she said. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it doesn’t matter whether sideloaded apps <em>are</em> <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/android-malware-scam-millions-lost-cpf-savings-banks-police-4128246\">dangerous</a>, or, say, that third-party browser engines may adversely affect battery life — Apple can’t make honest recommendations to its customers if those recommendations would discourage switching. Even though the entire reason many, if not most, people choose Apple products is that they trust Apple. The EU is not, obviously, America, but holy hell does it sound wrong to my American ears to claim it’s illegal for a company to offer customers the truth. (And this is exactly why I’ve been so <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/parsing_cooks_opening_statement\">adamantly opposed to Apple’s own anti-steering rules in the App Store</a> all along.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/19/vestager-reuters\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"396d3cacd7e3c3b5d3947b49a484884bf59aa417e4a68fe7e4724b791ad00cba","category":"Tech"}
