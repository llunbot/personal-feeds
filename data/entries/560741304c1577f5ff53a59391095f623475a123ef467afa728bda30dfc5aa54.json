In addition, the source indicated that Apple is internally testing interactive widgets for the Home Screen and Today View, but they are unclear if this feature will make the final cut.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/iOS-17-Widgets.jpeg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\n\"Active widgets are in testing, but not confirmed by any means,\" the source said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/analyst941/status/1646244654441181189\">in a tweet</a>. If made available to the public, the source said the interactive widgets would include one-tap buttons, sliders, and other dynamic content. The source shared additional alleged details about iOS 17 in a <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/the-new-features-coming-in-ios-17-exclusive-from-ios-ipados-watchos-development-team-insider.2386656/\">MacRumors Forums post</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIntroduced with iOS 14, Home Screen widgets currently offer very limited functionality, as noted in <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/creating-a-widget-extension\">Apple's developer documentation</a>. \"Widgets present read-only information and donâ€™t support interactive elements such as scrolling elements or switches,\" says Apple. These limitations could be related to battery life considerations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast year, the same source leaked accurate <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/31/iphone-14-pro-camera-cutout-indicators/\">details about the Dynamic Island</a> on the iPhone 14 Pro before the device was announced. However, given the source has yet to establish a long-term track record with Apple rumors, it remains to be seen if all of the latest details they have shared prove to be accurate this time around.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce iOS 17 during the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/apple-announces-wwdc-2023/\">WWDC 2023 keynote on June 5</a>, and as usual, the first beta version should be made available to developers for testing later that day. The first public beta will likely be released in July.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/ios-17-interactive-widgets-rumor/\">Apple Supposedly Considering Interactive Widgets for iOS 17</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-supposedly-considering-interactive-widgets-for-ios-17.2386663/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"560741304c1577f5ff53a59391095f623475a123ef467afa728bda30dfc5aa54","category":"Apple"}
