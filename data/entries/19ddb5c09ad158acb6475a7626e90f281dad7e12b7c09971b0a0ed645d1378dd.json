Last year, we partnered with IBM to host <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2023/10/are-you-near-houston-come-to-our-it-event-at-space-center-houston-on-november-1/\">an in-person event in the Houston area</a> where we all gathered together, had some cocktails, and talked about resiliency and the future of IT. Location always matters for things like this, and so we hosted it at Space Center Houston and had our cocktails amidst cool space artifacts. In addition to learning a bunch of neat stuff, it was awesome to hang out with all the amazing folks who turned up at the event. Much fun was had!</p>\n<p>This year, we're back partnering with IBM again and we're looking to repeat that success with not one, but <em>two</em> in-person gatherings—each featuring a series of panel discussions with experts and capping off with a happy hour for hanging out and mingling. Where last time we went central, this time we're going to the coasts—both east and west. Read on for details!</p>\n<h2>September: San Jose, California</h2>\n<p>Our first event will be in <a href=\"https://events.arstechnica.com/ibm_beyond-the-buzz-sanjose/home?ref=ArsEditApplicant\">San Jose on September 18</a>, and it's titled \"Beyond the Buzz: An Infrastructure Future with GenAI and What Comes Next.\" The idea will be to look at what generative AI means for the future of data management.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037812#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037812&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Lee Hutchinson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"19ddb5c09ad158acb6475a7626e90f281dad7e12b7c09971b0a0ed645d1378dd","category":"Tech"}
