It's likely that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/27/apple-watch-series-7-what-to-expect/\">Apple Watch Series 7 models</a> will be unveiled at the same event, and we've got more details on what to expect from that device and more below.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>iPhone 13 Satellite Communication Rumor Disputed</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently said the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/29/iphone-13-to-feature-leo-to-make-calls-and-text/\">iPhone 13 was \"likely\" to support Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication</a>, a feature that he said would allow iPhone users to make calls and send messages when cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity is unavailable, but the rumor has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/iphone-13-satellite-rumor-disputed/\">since been disputed by some experts in the field</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPhone-LEO-in-Space-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman later <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/apple-emergency-satellite-features-iphones/\">provided new details on what the satellite capabilities could mean</a> for future iPhones, but he says the feature is unlikely to launch this year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>What to Expect From the Apple Watch Series 7</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe next-generation Apple Watch is likely just weeks away, and rumors suggest it will be a notable upgrade, complete with a new design, larger display sizes, a new color option, and more. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/27/apple-watch-series-7-what-to-expect/\">Here is what to expect from the Apple Watch Series 7!</a>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/Apple-Watch-7-Unreleased-Feature-Flat.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple is also reported to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/multiple-new-apple-watch-health-features/\">working on several new health features for the Apple Watch</a>, but most if not all of the features are expected to launch in 2022 or later.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple to Let Apps Like Netflix and Spotify Offer Links for Account Sign Ups Outside of the App Store</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple this week announced that, starting in early 2022, it will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/apple-reader-app-changes-japan-ftc/\">allow developers of \"reader\" apps to include an in-app link to their website</a> for users to set up or manage an account. \"Reader\" apps allow a user to access previously purchased content or subscription-based content for digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video, according to Apple, such as Netflix, Spotify, and the Amazon Kindle app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/app-store-vs-developers.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the change is a step in the right direction towards a fairer App Store, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/02/developer-reaction-to-apple-reader-app-change/\">some developers think it isn't enough</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple Delays Rollout of Controversial Child Safety Features to Make Improvements</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/03/apple-delaying-rollout-of-child-safety-features/\">delayed the rollout of the child safety features</a> that it announced last month following negative feedback, the company has today announced.
