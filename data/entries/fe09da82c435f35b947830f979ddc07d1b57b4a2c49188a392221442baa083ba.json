{"title":"Why is pro cycling’s anti-doping body the MPCC losing its members?","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-mpcc","date":1747833445000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-mpcc\">Why is pro cycling’s anti-doping body the MPCC losing its members?</a></p>\n\n<p>At the end of last year, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe announced they were pulling out of the Mouvement Pour un Cyclisme Crédible (MPCC, or Movement for Credible Cycling). In a statement, the team said, ‘We are ending our membership after 12 years. In that time, many of the MPCC’s demands have become WADA/UCI rules. This shows how important our involvement has been during this time. Now we can move on to new challenges.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team’s withdrawal reduced the MPCC’s men’s WorldTour membership to just seven out of 18 teams. Some, including Ineos Grenadiers, have never been members. But why? In a sport still bearing scars from decades of doping scandals, why not sign up to a voluntary anti-doping body? Like many aspects of elite performance, it’s a grey area…</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Born out of scandal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The MPCC was formed by a group of teams during the 2007 Tour de France and headed by current president Roger Legeay, then manager of the Crédit Agricole team, which disbanded a year later. With the Puerto <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/doping-cycling\">doping</a> scandal still raw, AG2R Prévoyance, Agritubel, Bouygues Telecom, FDJ, Gerolsteiner and Crédit Agricole came together to form a voluntary body with the aim of going further than existing anti-doping rules and raising the ethical bar (ironically, Gerolsteiner would be caught up in their own scandal).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Membership has fluctuated over the years but at present, at men’s WorldTour level, just 39% of teams are members. That figure stood at 50% as recently as the beginning of 2024, but that February Alpecin-Deceuninck resigned. The reason for their withdrawal isn’t clear, but it’s worth noting the team announced an official ‘partnering’ with ketone brand DeltaG two months earlier. We’ll come back to the significance of that shortly.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-970x646.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-1140x759.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull.jpeg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Red Bull-Bora-Hangrohe/Getty Sport</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Then, Red Bull bought a majority stake in Bora-Hansgrohe and soon after came that statement from team boss <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ralph-denk-bora-hansgrohe\">Ralph Denk</a>. We contacted Red Bull for a little more insight. ‘Thanks for your mail,’ a spokesman for the team replied. ‘We’ve decided not to make any further comments.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We asked why they [Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe] were leaving,’ Legeay told us. ‘All they said was that the MPCC has done a good job but they don’t want to continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘On the positive side, a new team has come on board in the form of Unibet [Tietema Rockets]. That takes ProTeam membership up to 16.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s 16 out of a possible 17, or 94%, which is a significant uptake compared to WorldTour level. Why the disparity? Arguably it’s down to the fact that it’s not just teams who can sign up to the MPCC. The net covers other ‘stakeholders’ too, including riders, support staff, agents, sponsors and, vitally, race organisers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is that important? WorldTour teams automatically qualify for the major races, while teams at ProTeam level don’t. Cycling’s business model, which is disproportionately reliant on sponsors, means lining up at a high-profile race like the Tour de France is vital to securing greater investment into the team. No Tour means little media coverage, means a less-appealing offering to prospective sponsors. The importance of this is clear from an MPPC statement in June 2024 talking about the Tour de France start list.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-1481013108-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-1481013108-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-1481013108-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-1481013108-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-1481013108-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-1481013108-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-1481013108-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-1481013108-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-1481013108.jpg 1024w\" /><figcaption>Paris-Roubaix is one of the races organised by ASO.</figcaption><figcaption>Bernard Papon - Pool/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘This race is much more important for us because <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-tour-s-first-lady-meet-marie-odile-amaury\">Amaury Sport Organisation</a> (ASO), the race organiser, which has supported the MPCC for 12 years, made membership of our movement an essential condition for granting a wildcard,’ the statement reads. ‘Israel-Premier Tech, Lotto-Dstny, Uno-X Mobility and TotalEnergies are all members and are therefore committed to respect our rules.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That holds true across ASO’s portfolio of professional cycling races, which includes the men’s and women’s races at Paris-Roubaix, La Flèche Wallonne, Liège-Bastogne-Liège and the Vuelta a España.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> ‘The non-members say, “The MPCC does a good job but we have access to the biggest races so it’s unnecessary to join”,’ Legeay says. ‘Ultimately we’re a voluntary organisation and about a philosophy of clean sport. That’s why individuals can join for free. If a rider changes from an MPCC team to a non-MPCC team, that doesn’t mean their philosophy changes.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That ethical stance is true of Harry Tanfield, who has incredibly just started racing for his 11th team since turning professional with JLT-Condor in 2015. After Cornish Continental team Saint Piran folded at the end of last year, he now rides for the Ribble Outliers. His racing CV includes three teams at WorldTour level: Katusha-Alpecin, AG2R La Mondiale and Qhubeka-NextHash.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/07095220/harry_tanfield_qa_1-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"harry_tanfield_qa_1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/07095220/harry_tanfield_qa_1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/07095220/harry_tanfield_qa_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/07095220/harry_tanfield_qa_1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/07095220/harry_tanfield_qa_1-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/07095220/harry_tanfield_qa_1-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/07095220/harry_tanfield_qa_1-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/07095220/harry_tanfield_qa_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/07095220/harry_tanfield_qa_1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/07095220/harry_tanfield_qa_1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>British pro Harry Tanfield in 2022, at which point he was riding for Ribble Weldtite, his eighth different team of his career.

I’m still a member now.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So too are the likes of Denk and the sponsor Bora, which paints a confusing picture. They have enough belief in the MPCC to remain members individually, but not enough for the team to remain. Why is that?</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+8\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'like this article? get more of it every month in Cyclist magazine, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-8-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Raising the performance bar</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the teams themselves offering little insight, all we can do is speculate. In Bora-Hansgrohe’s case, Red Bull’s sports teams have forged a reputation for chasing new avenues when seeking peak performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its US performance centre, Red Bull has undertaken several seemingly outlandish projects in the search for competitive gains, including attaching electrodes to athletes’ heads in search of greater endurance. The company is known for pushing the (legal) boundaries – it is based on a performance-boosting drink, after all. That wouldn’t sit easy with the use of a substance like <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-are-ketones-cycling\">ketones</a>, which potentially taps into another energy pathway (again, we’ll come back to the importance of ketones shortly).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, if you’re pushing the boundaries of elite performance, you end up questioning where the limits should be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Since the beginning, we have been an anti-doping actor that performs in the grey area,’ says Legeay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That grey area arises from both the empirical research and its cycling implications catching up with the anecdotal evidence. Take the powerful painkiller Tramadol that former pro <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/renaissance-man-taylor-phinney-profile\">Taylor Phinney</a> said was ubiquitous throughout his career right up to his retirement in 2019.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175326/taylor_phinney_profile_04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"taylor_phinney_profile_04\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175326/taylor_phinney_profile_04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175326/taylor_phinney_profile_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175326/taylor_phinney_profile_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175326/taylor_phinney_profile_04-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175326/taylor_phinney_profile_04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175326/taylor_phinney_profile_04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175326/taylor_phinney_profile_04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175326/taylor_phinney_profile_04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175326/taylor_phinney_profile_04.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>American former pro Taylor Phinney.</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘You would smash a couple of Tramadol at the end of the race, along with caffeine and maybe some Sudafed,’ the American told <em>Canadian Cycling</em> magazine in 2022. ‘I mean, that’s a bomb right there. If I took one of those right now it would send me to the moon.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a painkiller, Tramadol would nullify pain in search of one last hit of speed during races. It was also, critics argued, responsible for crashes, especially at the end of races. MPCC’s voluntary rules forbade Tramadol from 2013 but it wasn’t until 2019 that the UCI banned its use in competition.

The announcement earlier this year defined the carbon monoxide test – used to measure the impact on the blood of altitude training – as allowable only in a medical facility by a medical professional and not undertaken more than twice in the space of two weeks.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/doping-lifetime-ban\">Should all dopers be banned for life?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-over-the-counter-medication-1\">Does cycling have a problem with over-the-counter medication?

In 2022 WADA banned the use of corticosteroids from competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether the use of corticosteroids by Team Sky, a fact that emerged from the notorious Jiffy bag scandal, is why the British team has never signed up to the MPCC remains to be seen. They, like many teams, made use of therapeutic exemption certificates (TUEs), which allow riders to take substances on the WADA banned list for medical reasons. In the past, the MPCC has been highly critical of the prevalence of TUEs but now, says Legeay, the MPCC trusts the ITA (International Testing Agency) to be more stringent about ‘the issuance of TUEs’, so the hope is that this grey area is now more black and white.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That certainly isn’t the case for ketones, however. This extra energy source has caused division in the peloton, with MPCC teams forbidden from taking them over concerns about their long-term effects. That hasn’t stopped non-MPCC members from using them, leaving Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels rider Arnaud Démare to suggest that ‘cycling operates at two speeds’: those who use ketones and those who don’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research into the performance benefits of ketone use suggests its impact isn’t perhaps as significant as Démare and marketing teams would have you believe, but there is an impact, especially for accelerated recovery during a Grand Tour.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/07/07091509/arnaud_demare-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"arnaud_demare\" /><figcaption>Former French Road Race Champion Arnaud Démare, who suggests the use of ketones means ‘cycling operates at two speeds’. </figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Until recently, ketones simmered underground, with teams denying their use as they would an illegal substance. That has changed in the past couple of years, however, with the likes of Soudal-QuickStep and Geraint Thomas announcing official partnerships with KetoneAid and Ketone-IQ respectively. But it remains off-limits for MPCC members pending UCI research into its safety that has dragged on since 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We asked the UCI years ago for their thoughts on ketone use and whether there were health implications,’ says Legeay. ‘They said they would put money on the table for a study, which they have done, and said before we have the result of the investigation we recommend not to use ketones. The problem is we’ve been waiting for the results for too long now, which isn’t great because I speculate that around 80% of the peloton is using them. Hopefully we should know by the end of this year.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cyclist</em> asked the UCI for a timeline. They straight-batted back, ‘Unfortunately the study is still in progress and we’re unable to provide an update at this moment.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s tricky when it comes to long-term health effects because how long do you wait?’ says Tanfield. ‘It could be like vaping, which could turn out to be bad for us. But it might not.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glacial progress is anathema to WorldTour teams used to fighting among themselves to secure the best data scientists, aerodynamicists and physiologists to gain a minor edge. A six-years-and-counting study into a potentially safe performance booster doesn’t do much to instil confidence in the MPCC. If they sign up, teams might argue, they could be left behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Follow the money</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paul-double-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paul-double-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paul-double-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paul-double-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paul-double-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paul-double-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paul-double-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paul-double-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paul-double-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/paul-double.jpg 1452w\" /><figcaption>Jayco-AlUla left the MPCC all the way back in 2016 while known as Orica-BikeExchange. </figcaption><figcaption>Jayco-AlUla/Tour of Oman</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Another argument is that non-members simply feel the MPCC has served its purpose and the sport has moved on. That certainly ties in with the Red Bull statement and also with Jayco-AlUla’s, which says, ‘Since the ITA have taken over the anti-doping system for cycling, it’s an extra investment for us and we trust in their vigorous anti-doping process. Therefore we do not feel the necessity of going through other organisations as well as the ITA.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ITA took over UCI anti-doping duties in 2021, albeit the Australian team actually left the MPCC in 2016, saying similarly that their job was done. As for that ‘extra investment’, registration with ITA costs a hefty €215,000 for a men’s WorldTeam and €100,000 for a men’s ProTeam (oddly, women’s WT teams don’t pay a fee to ITA but pay an ‘anti-doping contribution’ to the UCI of €15,000). By contrast, membership of MPCC is just €1,500, but some teams will still feel there is little reason to pay if they don’t see a tangible benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So where does that leave the MPCC in 2025? Those who grew up watching the likes of Pantani and Armstrong would suggest its anti-doping message is one that cycling should never tire of. But is that message relevant in a world increasingly dominated by pharma and, in cycling terms, one in which testing is undertaken by a dedicated body that uses cutting-edge technology to trap the cheats?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Didn’t Lance test 500 times with no positives?’ responds Legeay. ‘Aderlass was down to a police investigation, as was Puerto. If we want a credible sport, we have to look beyond testing. It’s a philosophy – it’s all about racing clean.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash_no-click-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-mpcc\">Why is pro cycling’s anti-doping body the MPCC losing its members?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"fe09da82c435f35b947830f979ddc07d1b57b4a2c49188a392221442baa083ba","category":"Cycling"}
