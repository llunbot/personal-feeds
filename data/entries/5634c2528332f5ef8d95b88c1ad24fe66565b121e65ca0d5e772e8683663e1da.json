If it's raining, for example, CARROT Weather can automatically switch over to a precipitation-focused UI.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/carrot-weather-layout-update.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nToday's update also introduces new layouts and designs for layout components, screenshot styles, along with support for wet-bulb temperature readings. Wet-bulb temperature readings are useful for determining human survivability in extreme heat events.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCARROT Weather can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> for free, and there is an optional $4.99 per month premium tier that unlocks new weather data sources, notifications, customization, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">widgets</a>, and Apple Watch complications.
