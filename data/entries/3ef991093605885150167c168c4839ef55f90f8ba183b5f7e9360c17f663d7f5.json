Passkeys offer enhanced security by reducing common risks associated with traditional passwords, such as phishing attacks and credential theft. Since authentication occurs directly on the user's device using biometric data or their device passcode, there are no passwords to compromise or intercept.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo set up a passkey, WeChat users need an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> running iOS 16 or iPadOS 16 or later with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Keychain and two-factor authentication enabled for their Apple Account. Users can enable the feature through WeChat's Account &amp; Security settings, according to a new <a href=\"https://safety.wechat.com/en_US/safety-tools/articles/log-in-with-a-passkey\">WeChat support document</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTencent-owned WeChat joins a growing list of major platforms that have adopted passkey technology, including Google, PayPal, Microsoft, and TikTok. In WeChat, the feature is currently limited to  users outside of China, and there's no word on if or when it might expand to the app's domestic Chinese version.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/passkeys/\">Passkeys</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wechat/\">WeChat</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/15/wechat-rolls-out-passkey-support-ios-outside-china/\">WeChat Rolls Out Passkey Support for iOS Users Outside China</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wechat-rolls-out-passkey-support-for-ios-users-outside-china.2443046/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3ef991093605885150167c168c4839ef55f90f8ba183b5f7e9360c17f663d7f5","category":"Apple"}
