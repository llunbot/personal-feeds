It is even more unfortunate that a team would not stand up for what is ethically the right thing to do – honouring the agreement and recognising the significant investments that were made by Scicon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We took a strong stance in this case and could not make an exception for one rider and believe all sponsors of professional cycling should take note.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scicon will have to settle for UAE Team Emirates and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a> for its TV exposure then. Shame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Main image: Sprint Cycling via Astana</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/scicon-astana-cavendish\">Scicon cuts ties with Astana over Mark Cavendish’s sunglasses</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Deputy Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"5825283285bd05bf38fbedf99d9713aa4aa4bb24dc1bcea1201c1e11be4283f0","category":"Cycling"}
