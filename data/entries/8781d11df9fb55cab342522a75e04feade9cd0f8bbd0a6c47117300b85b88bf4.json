Engineers inspecting the capsule after the flight found more than 100 locations where the stresses of reentry stripped away pieces of the heat shield as temperatures built up to 5,000° Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p>This was the most significant discovery on the Artemis I, an unpiloted test flight that took the Orion capsule around the Moon for the first time. The next mission in NASA's Artemis program, Artemis II, is scheduled for launch late next year on a test flight to send four astronauts around the far side of the Moon.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023003#p3\">Read 37 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023003&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8781d11df9fb55cab342522a75e04feade9cd0f8bbd0a6c47117300b85b88bf4","category":"Tech"}
