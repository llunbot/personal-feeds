In <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/11/07/meh\">my thank-you post to Meh a decade ago</a>, “I’ve been selling weekly DF RSS feed sponsorships since 2007 — just a hair under 400 consecutive weeks. I’ve never had one quite like this week’s.” I’m now up to 17 years of weekly DF sponsors, 887 weeks and counting, and while Meh has sponsored multiple times in the ensuing years, it remains true that there’s never been another DF sponsor quite like (or maybe even <em>at all</em> like) Meh.</p>\n\n<p>For their sponsored entry in last week’s feed, Meh co-founder <a href=\"https://xoxo.zone/@_\">Dave Rutledge</a> decided to re-run the exact same post they ran the first time 10 years ago. Here it is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Fucking Amazon</p>\n\n<p>I sold Woot to Amazon and they made it shitty. So I quit. Then I\ngot bored.</p>\n\n<p>I started <a href=\"https://mediocre.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=fuckingamazon\">A Mediocre\nCorporation</a>\nwith a few others from Woot. We just launched a classic daily deal\nsite — only one thing for sale each day. <a href=\"\nhttps://meh.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=fuckingamazon\">Meh.</a></p>\n\n<p>Oh, and since you seem to be into RSS, we put one together just\nfor you, at <a href=\"https://meh.com/deals.rss\">meh.com/deals.rss</a>. Of\ncourse you can also just go to\n<a href=\"https://meh.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=fuckingamazon\">meh.com</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When this ran 10 years ago, the headline — “Fucking Amazon” was so unusual that a bunch of readers were concerned that my site had been hacked. Nope, not hacked, just sponsored by Meh. I thank Meh for sponsoring DF last week, thank them for a decade of ongoing support, and I thank them for making me laugh.</p>\n\n<p>Also: the daily deals at Meh really are fun. I <a href=\"https://meh.com/deals.rss\">follow on RSS</a> — you’ll be amused every morning, and you’ll find a surprising number of things you want to buy.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/meh\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b137c901a05890630d4949474216d92a669b387f40b1d56621f96cead567ce6d","category":"Tech"}
