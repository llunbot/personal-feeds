These cable ends are reusable, made in the USA, and are a fun way to add color to your cable-actuated brake bikes. Well, this round of Cable Cherries is a collaborative effort between Forager and a local blueberry farm, Bow Hill, who suffered a massive loss recently. A fire started in the refrigerated zone of their production barn and burned nearly all the contents, including a ride-on harvesting machine parked outside. Forager is offering an option to donate at checkout on these new Cable Cherries in hopes to raise money to help out Blue Hill.
