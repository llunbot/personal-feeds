There’s a problem, though – your lights and computer (and maybe derailleurs) are dead, your tires are flat with dried-up sealant, your clothes are missing, and your bike has been neglected all winter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take this as your friendly reminder to prep all your gear <em>before</em> those surprise early-spring days. I know I could have used one. You think at this point I’d be better at this, but every year it seems to be the same old story. Over the winter, I primarily ride fat bikes off-road, so I have no use for the lights, radar, and computers I normally use for gravel and road riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same goes for electronic drivetrains. Even if your derailleurs aren’t completely dead, it’s a good idea to charge the batteries before you head out for the first time of the year (and don’t forget to use the apps to check on the coin cell batteries in the shifters!). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, many of you may be smirking to yourself, thinking, <em>that’s one of the reasons <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dear-bike-industry-please-dont-take-away-my-high-end-mechanical-drivetrains/\" target=\"_blank\">I’m keeping my mechanical drivetrains</a>.</em> And you’re right. The prevalence of batteries throughout almost every corner of cycling gear has gotten a bit ridiculous. Years ago, I finally invested in a multi-port USB charging station, and it was one of the best things I’ve done for trying to keep all the various electronic gadgets functioning. It not only allows me to charge many things at once, but acts as an area to keep all the lights, computers, radars, cameras, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/oakley-meta-vanguard-ai-cycling-sunglasses-first-impressions/\">sunglasses</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/trek-electric-mini-pump-air-rush/\">mini inflators</a>, electronic bells/speakers, watches, heart rate monitors, and derailleur/seatpost/shock batteries in one place. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prep Those Tires</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Tires-sealant-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Tires-sealant-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Tires-sealant-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Tires-sealant-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Tires-sealant-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Tires-sealant-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Tires-sealant-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Tires-sealant-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gravel-Tires-sealant-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While you’re at it, if you’re running tubeless, it’s time to refresh that tire sealant. Your tires will likely hold air perfectly well as the sealant has dried inside and plugged up any small leaks. But get another puncture while you’re out riding, and the dried sealant will no longer flow to the new hole. It’s a good chance to also inspect the tires – do you have any foreign objects embedded in the tread? Any cuts, bulges, or fraying sidewalls? If so, do yourself a favor and swap in a new tire now. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Else?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rotaluber-chain-lube-tool-ebike-backpedal-tool-4-2.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rotaluber-chain-lube-tool-ebike-backpedal-tool-4-2-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rotaluber-chain-lube-tool-ebike-backpedal-tool-4-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rotaluber-chain-lube-tool-ebike-backpedal-tool-4-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rotaluber-chain-lube-tool-ebike-backpedal-tool-4-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rotaluber-chain-lube-tool-ebike-backpedal-tool-4-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rotaluber-chain-lube-tool-ebike-backpedal-tool-4-2-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rotaluber-chain-lube-tool-ebike-backpedal-tool-4-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rotaluber-chain-lube-tool-ebike-backpedal-tool-4-2-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lubing (or waxing) your chain is an obvious one. If your chain is dry, slightly rusty, or just excessively dirty, take the time to clean and lubricate it. If you have suspension, give the stanchions and seals a quick wipe with a clean rag to remove any excess dirt. You’ll also want to check the air pressure in your suspension if it’s been a while. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those with mechanical drivetrains don’t need to check their batteries, but it is a good idea to check your cables. Look for housing with compressed ends under the housing end caps, so that the inner wire strands are exposed (you can cut this flush, and open the end with a pick). Also, check that the cable is running smoothly through the housing as you shift through all the gears. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don’t Forget the Clothing!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, you don’t have to charge your clothes (unless you have some of those <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-sealskinz-waterproof-heated-cycle-gloves-and-waterproof-all-weather-socks/\" target=\"_blank\">heated gloves</a>, boots, helmets with lights, etc.), but it should be washed and readily available. The first ride of the year always seems to be a scramble to locate the ideal pair of gloves, bibs, headwear, etc. Knowing where it is ahead of time means less time trying to gather your kit, and more time enjoying the sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nutrition?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-1.jpg\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-1.jpg\" alt=\"Nutrition\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-1.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-1-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-1-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Looks like I need to restock some waffles</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on how long you plan to ride and what kind of nutrition you use, you may need to think about that ahead of time, too. Usually, at this time of the year, my stash of bars, waffles, chews, powders, and gels is either greatly diminished or expired because I forgot about them at the bottom of some bag. If you plan to need them, make sure to go out and buy them ahead of time so you’re ready for that ride whenever it may be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t forget to have some bottles clean and ready to go as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ready? Time to Ride</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-3.jpg\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-3.jpg\" alt=\"Gravel bike in snow\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-3.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-3-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-3-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-3-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spring-Bike-Ride-preparation-How-to-get-ready-for-first-ride-of-the-year-3-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>My first gravel/road ride of the year inspired this – dead batteries, flat tires, missing clothing, and the frustration of having to cut the ride short on a 65º day because I ran out of time. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Take it from me – a little time spent preparing now will mean that your first ride of the year will be remembered for how great it was to be back outside, rather than how long it took you to get ready. If you’ve already been riding this year, or never take any time off, then you should be good to go. But it’s still a good time to check your bike to make sure it’s in top condition for the heart of the cycling season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you out there!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/heres-your-psa-to-charge-electronics-refresh-tire-sealant-get-bikes-ready-before-its-too-late/\">Here’s Your PSA to Charge Electronics, Refresh Tire Sealant &amp; Get Bikes Ready Before It’s Too Late</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6eddae7a1182594df4524d420c9078276fdd060f82a038d55914cfba84c6d924","category":"Cycling"}
