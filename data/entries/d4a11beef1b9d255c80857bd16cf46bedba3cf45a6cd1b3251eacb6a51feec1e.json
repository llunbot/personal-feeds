According to reports on <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-3-beta-2-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2415339/\">the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrandonButch/status/1742628347002204350\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@_inside/111693591558795389\">Mastodon</a>, some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> owners who updated found their devices stuck in a boot loop.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe only fix to the issue appears to be restoring a stuck device, which is why Apple has pulled the update. Once the bug is addressed, Apple will re-release the beta.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are reports that suggest the iOS 17.3 boot loop bug <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@_inside/111693804775894724\">could be related</a> to the Back Tap setting. A log shared by developer Guilherme Rambo indicates that a Back Tap setting caused his device to crash, and there have been several other affected users who have Back Tap enabled in some capacity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome others who had Back Tap enabled were able to install the update, and others who did not have the feature on had the booting issue, so it is not entirely clear how Back Tap is involved.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/apple-pulls-ios-17-3-beta-2/\">Apple Pulls iOS 17.3 Beta 2 Due to Boot Loop Issue</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pulls-ios-17-3-beta-2-due-to-boot-loop-issue.2415355/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d4a11beef1b9d255c80857bd16cf46bedba3cf45a6cd1b3251eacb6a51feec1e","category":"Apple"}
