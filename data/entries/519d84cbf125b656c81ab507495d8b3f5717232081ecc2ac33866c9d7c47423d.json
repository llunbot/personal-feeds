It also put the Polishing Cloth under a microscope and discovered that it’s made of “minuscule fibers intricately woven together,” but earned a 0 out of 10 repairability score for “not going back together after we cut it into pieces with scissors.” They even made a top-tier American Psycho reference, captioning a photo with “Look at that off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh, my God. It even has a watermark.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ordered one, you can <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.ifixit.com/News/54122/macbook-pro-2021-teardown&amp;xcust=1-1-548070-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">read iFixit’s full report</a> while you wait a long time for it to arrive.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"519d84cbf125b656c81ab507495d8b3f5717232081ecc2ac33866c9d7c47423d","category":"Apple"}
