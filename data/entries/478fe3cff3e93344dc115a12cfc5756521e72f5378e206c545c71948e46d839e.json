{"title":"Slate Truck: A $20–30K American-Made Electric Small Pickup With No Paint, No Stereo, No Touchscreen","link":"https://www.theverge.com/electric-cars/655527/slate-electric-truck-price-paint-radio-bezos","date":1747602874000,"content":"\n<p>Month-old news but I’m cleaning up tabs today. I love everything about this pickup except the fact that it doesn’t have a speaker system built-in. No one wants to put a Bluetooth boombox in their cabin and, worse, isn’t that sort of an obvious safety hazard? You get in a crash and now there’s a boombox flying around inside. Just put a simple bluetooth speaker system in.</p>\n\n<p>But the aesthetics of this are chef’s-kiss good. It’s a beautiful little truck. It gets everything right that the Cybertruck gets wrong.</p>\n\n<p>However, I have some questions about how real this is. You pay $50 now to get in the queue for pre-orders, but pre-orders haven’t even started. Deliveries are supposed to start in “late 2026” but Car and Driver is <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a64564869/2027-slate-truck-revealed/\">cautiously describing it as a “2027 truck EV”</a>. I’m rooting for them but at this point it’s a promise not a truck.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/18/slate-truck\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"478fe3cff3e93344dc115a12cfc5756521e72f5378e206c545c71948e46d839e","category":"Tech"}
