The controllers also broadcast the unencrypted email address, device ID, first name, and last initial corresponding to each one, along with the message required to open or shut a door or turn on or off a smart plug or schedule such a command for a later time.</p>\n<h2>Immediately unplug all Nexx devices</h2>\n<p>The result: Anyone with a moderate technical background can search Nexx servers for a given email address, device ID, or name and then issue commands to the associated controller. (Nexx controllers for home security alarms are susceptible to a similar class of vulnerabilities.) Commands allow the opening of a door, turning off a device connected to a smart plug, or disarming an alarm. Worse still, over the past three months, personnel for Texas-based Nexx haven’t responded to multiple private messages warning of the vulnerabilities.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929120#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929120&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8043bcc6db9aff1cc224b9ce3feefa5fbac6b1577cf5c03c9c63667b6b8ff32c","category":"Tech"}
