And in the latest update, it just picked up <a href=\"https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:1-1-1790252-1-0-0/destination:https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/04/18/new-adobe-lightroom-ai-innovations-empower-everyone-edit-like-pro\">a slew of new features</a> that will make your iPhone photos look even better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the power of AI, a new feature called <a href=\"https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:1-1-1790252-1-0-0/destination:https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/04/18/denoise-demystified\">Denoise</a> will “remove digital noise from your images to improve quality without losing any details.”<strong> </strong>As Adobe explains, it’s especially useful when working with low-light photos, when noise and grain can overwhelm a photo. Adobe says Denoise uses AI and machine learning to deliver “natural-looking results with crisp edges, clean shadows, good preservation of texture and small colors, and minimal artifacts (like uneven splotches).”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature is compatible with Bayer and X-Trans mosaic RAW files, which doesn’t include Apple ProRaw DNG files, but Abobe says additional file types are coming soon. Lightroom already supports ProRaw for other functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also new in Lightroom is the ability to automatically mask clothing and facial hair, a new Polished Portrait preset that “enables you to quickly smooth the skin on portraits, enhance the lighting, and refine facial features,” and a quick way to turn videos black and white.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, a new Curves in masking feature offers “fine control over tonality and color in specific regions of a photo to help you achieve the perfect look.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new features are part of the latest version of Lightroom, which is <a href=\"https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:1-1-1790252-1-0-0/destination:https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom/compare-plans.html\">part of the Adobe Creative Cloud</a>. It is available on a subscription basis for $9.99 a month or $19.99 a month with Photoshop.</p>\n\nMac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f80217f5ba31065ee6b5c9f720cf3e031507f3235e0f7325f87411677a88106a","category":"Apple"}
