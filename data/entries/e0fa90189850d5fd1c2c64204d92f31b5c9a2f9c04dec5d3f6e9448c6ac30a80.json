Affected users are seeing their iPhones freeze unexpectedly and then reboot.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-colors-1.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nReports about the issue have been ongoing since the ‌iPhone 16‌ models first launched in September, and have continued to this week. The iOS 18.0.1 and iOS 18.1 updates do not fix the issue, as it has continued to happen to users even after installing the latest software.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe problem seems to pop up randomly. The display will stop responding or will be very slow to respond to touch input, and then the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> will do a quick restart. There have also been reports of the ‌iPhone‌ restarting unexpectedly when in StandBy mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome users who contacted Apple shortly after the new iPhones launched were able to get replacement devices, but have had the issue reoccur. Almost all of the complaints are about the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> or ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max, so it may only be the Pro models that are impacted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor most people, the issue is sporadic, but some users have seen 10 to 20 crashes per day. In some cases, doing a fresh install and not reinstalling from an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Backup seems to have fixed the problem, so it is possible that this is a bug related to ‌iCloud‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLet us know in the comments below if you've been experiencing this freezing and crashing issue.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-16-pro-restart-bug/\">iPhone 16 Pro Bug Causing Random Freezing and Restarts</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-bug-causing-random-freezing-and-restarts.2440438/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e0fa90189850d5fd1c2c64204d92f31b5c9a2f9c04dec5d3f6e9448c6ac30a80","category":"Apple"}
