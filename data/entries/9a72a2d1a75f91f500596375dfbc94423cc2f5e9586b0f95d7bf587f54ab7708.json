Riding in the rain or winter months can lead to bearing corrosion. <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/kogel-bearings/\" target=\"_blank\">Kogel Bearings</a>’ new CR (corrosion-resistant) bicycle bearings combine a hardened, corrosion-resistant steel race with ceramic bearings and condition-specific seals to keep the grime out of your bearings. These new CR bearings use stainless steel treated with a proprietary hardening process, yielding a rust-proof bearing race that’s hard enough to hold up to their premium ceramic bearings.</p>\n<p>The new Kogel CR bearings will now be available as an upgrade in all bottom brackets and ship as standard in all of their aftermarket pulley wheels and the oversized pulleys in their Kolossos oversized derailleur cage.</p>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=3a860120-eba4-4d89-ad33-eb1e839c8786&amp;website_id=6ec3743b-a948-4c16-9d12-4b79ac107f25&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kogel.cc%2Fblogs%2Fkbba%2Fintroducing-kogel-cr-corrosion-resistant-ceramic-bearings-for-bicycles\" target=\"_blank\">Kogel Bearings</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/kogels-new-cr-corrosion-resistant-bearings/\">Kogel’s New CR (Corrosion Resistant) Bearings</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"9a72a2d1a75f91f500596375dfbc94423cc2f5e9586b0f95d7bf587f54ab7708","category":"Cycling"}
