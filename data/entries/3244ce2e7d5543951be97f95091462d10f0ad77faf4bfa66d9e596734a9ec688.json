{"title":"M4 iPad Pro Bend Tests: Durability Equal to M2 Model Despite Thinness","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/16/m4-ipad-pro-bend-tests-durability/","date":1715863814000,"content":"The first M4 iPad Pro bend tests are in, and the initial consensus appears to be that Apple has managed to make its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/ipod-nano-appears-in-new-ipad-pro-ad/\">thinnest device ever</a> just as durable as the previous generation M2 iPad Pro that it replaces.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/bend-test-ipad-pro-1.jpg\" width=\"2932\" height=\"1646\" />\r<br />\nTwo approaches were taken in bend tests by prominent tech YouTubers. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GN6ZlssqNAE\">JerryRigEverything</a> for example forcibly applied pressure by bending the new device with his hands, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6LSoVJZfAU\">MobileReviewsEh</a> took a different tack by placing the iPad under a force meter and applying gym weights on top to exert pressure within a limited contact area.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen bending the iPad Pro from the back in the horizontal position, JerryRigEverything found that the device held up \"surprisingly well,\" as if \"suspicious levels of black magic structural integrity\" were going on. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen forcibly bent from the back, the glass screen eventually rippled away from the frame, yet the display and operating system continued to function normally. When it came to putting pressure on the device vertically, however, it was a different story, and the iPad Pro quickly suffered a catastrophic split up the middle, originating from the USB-C port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nJerryRigEverything then removed the display to reveal and remove the internals, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/ipad-pro-structural-design-avoid-bendgate/\">new metal cowling</a> that runs down the middle of the device. \"If Apple could add another more perpendicular spine running width-wise near the charging port, this thing probably would have survived,\" he added.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nJerryRigEverything concluded that the central spine of the new iPad Pro is \"definitely providing enough structure for horizontal bends,\" and should stand up to everyday use in a backpack or luggage. In his own <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Oi7TMbWgJ4Y\">AppleTrack</a> test, Sam Kohl agreed: \"Is [its thinness] a durability risk? The answer is no. The spine that Apple put along the logic board is very good unless you are bending the corners in.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nAfter placing in excess of 70 pounds of weight on the center of the iPad Pro display until complete structural failure, MobileReviewsEh concluded that the new iPad Pro is \"just as tough if not a little bit tougher\" than the one it replaces, despite being 18-20% thinner than the M2 iPad Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll in all, another \"bendgate\" looks unlikely. For those unfamiliar with the controversy, Apple in 2019 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/19/apple-2018-ipad-pros-ship-bent/\">admitted</a> to shipping its then-new models with a \"very slight bend in the aluminum chassis,\" which it blamed on a \"side effect of the manufacturing process.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite videos indicating that the 2018 iPad Pro models bent more easily than other models, Apple said the bend did not worsen over time or negatively affect the iPad's performance, and that concerns over the device's durability were unfounded. Nevertheless, some iPad owners were understandably upset to find defects in devices that cost hundreds of dollars. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro\">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/16/m4-ipad-pro-bend-tests-durability/\">M4 iPad Pro Bend Tests: Durability Equal to M2 Model Despite Thinness</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-ipad-pro-bend-tests-durability-equal-to-m2-model-despite-thinness.2426535/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3244ce2e7d5543951be97f95091462d10f0ad77faf4bfa66d9e596734a9ec688","category":"Apple"}
