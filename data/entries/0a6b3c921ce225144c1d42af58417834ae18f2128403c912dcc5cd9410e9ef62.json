Focus says it uses three types of carbon to find a balance between stiffness for fast acceleration and stability at higher speeds, as well as being durable and delivering a compliant ride.</p>\n<p>The seatstays’ carbon layup and profiles are optimised for flex and comfort on rough terrain, according to the brand.</p>\n<p>Focus claims an unpainted size-medium frame weighs 995g, and says the bike is 1.7kg lighter than the 6 series, but doesn’t provide a model comparison or size.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s still a little room to spare around the 45mm tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus</i></span></div>\n<p>The Atlas 8 has clearance for 700c x 45mm or 650b x 2in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">gravel bike tyres</a>.</p>\n<p>Focus includes rubber protection underneath the base of the down tube to protect against rock strikes, as well as on the driveside chainstay.</p>\n<p>The Atlas 8 uses a round 27.2mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/seatposts/\">seatpost</a> and is compatible with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper post</a>.

You’ll need to use <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-wheels/\">mountain bike wheels</a> or re-lace the rim on a gravel wheelset to a Boost-spaced hub.</p>\n<p>The rear thru-axle specced on the Atlas 8 bikes includes 4 and 6mm hex keys, as well as a bottle opener for a refreshing post-ride beverage.</p>\n<h2>Mounting mania</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are mounts either side of the fork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus</i></span></div>\n<p>The Atlas 8 can accept three <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-water-bottles/\">water bottles</a> – two inside the main triangle and another underneath the down tube towards the bottom bracket junction.</p>\n<p>There are bento box mounts on the top tube and the bikes come with a top tube bag.</p>\n<p>Three mounting eyelets adorn each fork leg, with Focus saying you can load up to 3kg either side.</p>\n<p>The Atlas 8 has a total system weight limit of 120kg.</p>\n<h3>Adventure Rack</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Adventure Rack gives you another 6kg of cargo real estate.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus</i></span></div>\n<p>Focus is debuting its new Adventure Rack on the Atlas 8. The rack is mounted on the seatstay bridge and at the seatstay-dropout junction.</p>\n<p>Like the fork mounts, Focus says you can load up to 3kg on each side and claims it won’t wobble, even on rough terrain.</p>\n<p>You can also fit <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguards</a> (Focus makes its own, or you can use an aftermarket option) and the Adventure Rack at the same time.</p>\n<h2>Fully integrated to make space for bikepacking bags</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Atlas’ integration is certainly clean-looking.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus</i></span></div>\n<p>The Atlas 8 is fully integrated. The Atlas 6 routes its cables and hoses externally before they enter a port through the headset cover.</p>\n<p>Focus is introducing its upgraded C.I.S. (Cockpit Integration Solution) on the Atlas 8. A similar system exists on the brand’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/focus-izalco-max-9-7-axs-review/\">Izalco Max</a> road bike.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The cables and hoses are routed underneath the stem.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus</i></span></div>\n<p>This sees the cables and hoses run into the stem from the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-bike-handlebars-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-ones/\">handlebars</a>, before passing through the upper headset bearing.</p>\n<p>Focus says this new solution is backwards-compatible with the Atlas 6.</p>\n<p>Because the cables aren’t exposed, Focus says the move to full integration provides more real estate to mount <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bikepacking-bags/\">bikepacking bags</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-stems/\">stem</a> is offered in 70 to 120mm lengths and Focus uses two-piece headset spacers so you can easily <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-adjust-your-handlebar-height/\">adjust the handlebar height</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can mount a computer on top of the stem if you’re running a bag up-front.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus</i></span></div>\n<p>Focus also makes a specific <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">bike computer</a> mount for the stem that attaches at the faceplate, as well as a fitting underneath for a GoPro or front light.</p>\n<p>If you’re running a bag at the front, Focus also produces a top-cap mounting option.</p>\n<h2>Focus Atlas 8 geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The geometry differs slightly from the Atlas 6.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Like the Atlas 6, Focus says it has designed the Atlas 8 around a longer reach and shorter stem, albeit with some differences.</p>\n<p>The stem lengths are 10mm longer than on the Atlas 6, so a size medium now comes with a 90 rather than 80mm stem.</p>\n<p>Focus has also shortened the head tube length for a “more sporty geometry with a lower riding position”. This is combined with a lower stack.</p>\n<p>The short 425mm chainstay length is designed to make the bike “playful and agile”.</p>\n<p>Like the Atlas 6, all bikes have a slack 70.5-degree head tube angle and 73.5-degree seat tube angle (with the exception of the XS size, which has a 74-degree seat tube angle).</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿</th><th>XS</th><th>S</th><th>M</th><th>L</th><th>XL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b> Head tube angle </b>(degrees)</td><td>70.5</td><td>70.5</td><td>70.5</td><td>70.5</td><td>70.5</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Head tube length</b> (mm)</td><td>115</td><td>120</td><td>130</td><td>150</td><td>180</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Seat tube angle </b>(degrees)</td><td>74</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.5</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Seat tube length </b>(mm)</td><td>445</td><td>485</td><td>515</td><td>545</td><td>585</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Top tube length </b>(mm)</td><td>531</td><td>549</td><td>567</td><td>591</td><td>606</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Chainstay length </b>(mm)</td><td>425</td><td>425</td><td>425</td><td>425</td><td>425</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Wheelbase </b>(mm)</td><td>1,016</td><td>1,028</td><td>1,046</td><td>1,068</td><td>1,088</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Reach </b>(mm)</td><td>370</td><td>380</td><td>395</td><td>410</td><td>420</td>        </tr><tr><td><b> Stack </b>(mm)</td><td>569</td><td>574</td><td>583</td><td>611</td><td>630</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<h2>Focus Atlas 8 spec and pricing</h2>\n<h3>Focus Atlas 8.9</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Focus Atlas 8.9 in Goldbrown.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus </i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame:</strong> Carbon disc, C.I.S. integration, 148x12mm thru-axle</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> Carbon disc</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> SRAM Rival XPLR eTap AXS, 12-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Wheelset:</strong> DT Swiss GR1600</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> WTB Riddler TCS, 700c x 45mm</li>\n<li><strong>Weight (unspecified size):</strong> 8.7kg</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £4,199 / €4,299</li>\n</ul><h3>Focus Atlas 8.8</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Focus Atlas 8.8 in Cremewhite.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame:</strong> Carbon disc, C.I.S. integration, 148x12mm thru-axle</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> Carbon disc</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> Shimano GRX-810 with 105 R7000 cassette, 11-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Wheelset:</strong> DT Swiss X1900</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> WTB Riddler TCS, 700c x 45mm</li>\n<li><strong>Weight (unspecified size):</strong> 9.1kg</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £3,399 / €3,499</li>\n</ul><h3>Focus Atlas 8.7</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Focus Atlas 8.7 in Black.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame:</strong> Carbon disc, C.I.S. integration, 148x12mm thru-axle</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> Carbon disc</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> Shimano GRX-810 with GRX-600 shifters and crankset, 105 R7000 cassette, 11-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Wheelset:</strong> Novatec 25 Elite</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> WTB Riddler TCS, 700c x 45mm</li>\n<li><strong>Weight (unspecified size):</strong> 9.6kg</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £2,899 / €2,999</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"0a6b3c921ce225144c1d42af58417834ae18f2128403c912dcc5cd9410e9ef62","category":"Cycling"}
