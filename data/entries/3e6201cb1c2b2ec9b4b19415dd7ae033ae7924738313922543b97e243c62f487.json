The dimmer works with ELV devices and with nearly all residential lighting types and loads, such as LED, MLV, incandescent, and halogen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike the Smart Dimmer Switch for ELV+ Lighting, the Diva version uses phase-selectable dimming to enable dimming across a range of load types. Installers can select between forward or reverse-phase dimming in the Lutron app or when installing the light.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Diva smart dimmer with ELV+ is available in white, ivory, light almond, black, brown, and gray to match other switches and outlets in the home.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLutron is also introducing new color options for the Pico Paddle Remote, which was previously only available in white. The Pico Paddle Remote now comes in white, ivory, light almond, black, brown, and gray, much like other Caséta accessories.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lutron-pico-paddle-colors.jpg\" width=\"1112\" height=\"623\" />\r<br />\nThe Pico Paddle Remote can control Caséta smart switches and dimmers and Serena smart shades and fans, adding extra control options for lights and smart home products. The Pico Paddle Remotes have a 10-year battery life and do not require a hub, app, or Wi-Fi for operation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Diva smart dimmer ELV+ and new Pico Paddle Remote options <a href=\"https://www.casetawireless.com/us/en/products/dimmers-switches\">are available through</a> electrical distributors and online retailers that carry Caséta controls.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lutron/\">Lutron</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/lutron-elv-diva-smart-dimmer/\">Lutron Debuts New Diva Smart Dimmer With ELV+, Additional Pico Paddle Remote Colors</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lutron-debuts-new-diva-smart-dimmer-with-elv-additional-pico-paddle-remote-colors.2431490/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3e6201cb1c2b2ec9b4b19415dd7ae033ae7924738313922543b97e243c62f487","category":"Apple"}
