That's more than the $406 billion Americans spent in 2022 on all prescription drugs combined.</p>\n<p>While the bulk of the spending on weight-loss drugs will occur in the commercial market—which could easily lead to spikes in health insurance premiums—taxpayer-funded Medicare and Medicaid programs will also see an extraordinary financial burden. In the scenario that half of adults with obesity go on the drug, the cost to those federal programs would total $166 billion per year, rivaling the programs' total 2022 drug costs of $175 billion.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025320#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025320&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"021006d46cc74d9a030bb857b253cd65ebc609570c56b3e7178cadcce74655bf","category":"Tech"}
