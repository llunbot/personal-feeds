We've aggregated everything new that we've found in the second beta so far. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-iOS-17-Feature-Blue-Green.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Update Screen</h2>\r<br />\nThis is technically a feature from the first beta, but the update screen now shows more information about beta software. It includes details about joining a beta program and backing up before you install beta software.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-beta-2-updates.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>App Tips</h2>\r<br />\nVarious Apple-designed apps are utilizing a tips feature that provides details on available functionality. In the Messages app, for example, there's a tip about sending a message by talking instead of typing with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-tips-in-apps.jpg\" alt width=\"1977\" height=\"1112\" />\r<br />\nWhen AirDropping, there's a suggestion to hold the phone near another phone if you don't see people nearby.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Location Settings</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Systems Settings section of the Location privacy options, there is a new \"MicroLocation\" option. Apple does not explain what this is. App Clips Location Confirmation has disappeared as an option, as has Standby Clock Faces.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-microlocation.jpg\" alt width=\"2391\" height=\"1345\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Messages Check In</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Messages section of the Settings app, Apple has changed the wording of the data options for the Check-In feature. Options are now \"Full\" and \"Limited,\" rather than \"Current location only\" and \"All locations visited.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/messages-check-in-changes.jpg\" alt width=\"3345\" height=\"1882\" />\r<br />\nLimited data is described as current location and details about battery and network signal, while Full includes all limited data plus route traveled and location of last <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> unlock and Apple Watch removal. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Music App</h2>\r<br />\nActivating Crossfade for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> in the Settings app no longer crashes the Settings app, plus there is a customizable length for the Crossfade feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-music-crossfade-length.jpg\" alt width=\"2558\" height=\"1439\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>StandBy</h2>\r<br />\nThere's now an option to toggle off notifications when in StandBy mode. Notifications classified as \"Critical\" will be delivered even when the feature is off. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/standby-ios-17-show-notifications.jpg\" alt width=\"3343\" height=\"1880\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Music Widgets</h2>\r<br />\nSome of the ‌Apple Music‌ widgets are now available in different size options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-music-widgets.jpg\" alt width=\"4470\" height=\"2936\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Other New Features</h2>\r<br />\nFind something that we didn't mention here?
