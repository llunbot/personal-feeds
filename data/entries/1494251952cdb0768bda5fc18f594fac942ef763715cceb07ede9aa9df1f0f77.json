Unlike individual icon customization, tinting affects every icon on your app pages, Home Screen, and App Library, creating a unified look across your entire interface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTinting works by first desaturating all icons and then applying a single color overlay. This process results in a monochromatic appearance, which means you'll lose the original colors of your app icons and widgets, but what you gain is a more cohesive look. It's a powerful tool for creating a coordinated, stylish interface that reflects your personal taste, so be sure to experiment with it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo choose a tint color, you can also use an eyedropper tool to select a shade from your wallpaper, or manually adjust hue and saturation using two slider bars. This flexibility allows you to perfectly match your icons to your background or create a contrasting color scheme.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLastly, it's important to remember that the tint setting is universal. You can't apply different tints to different app pages or sections of your device. Whatever color you choose will be applied everywhere icons appear. Here's how to tint your icons in iOS 18:\r<br />\n<ol>\r<br />\n  <li>Long press a space on your Home Screen.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Tap <strong>Edit</strong> in the top-right corner.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Tap <strong>Customize</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Select the <strong>Tinted</strong> option.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Adjust the sliders to change the tint.
