Gjovik claims that Apple fired her in retaliation for bringing workplace-related health concerns to light.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>The department declined to say who had requested the investigation or what it was about, but Ashley Gjovik, a former employee who has been outspoken about misconduct at Apple, said she had filed the complaint \"to ensure Apple knows they cannot get away with retaliating against me for exercising my federally and state-protected rights.\"</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\nGjovik last week received a letter from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Whistleblower Protection Program that confirmed the department will conduct an investigation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple told <em>The New York Times</em> that it is \"deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive, inclusive workplace\" and that it does not comment on specific employees.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBack in September, Apple retail and people chief Deirdre O'Brien encouraged employees <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/06/apple-executive-addresses-employee-concerns/\">who are experiencing issues</a> to talk to their managers and their \"business relations partner.\" Apple, she said, has a \"confidential process\" to investigate complaints in a way that \"treats everyone with dignity and respect.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/\">facing an investigation</a> from the National Labor Relations Board, and Gjovik has also filed complaints with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/us-labor-department-apple-investigation/\">U.S. Labor Department Opens Investigation Into Apple</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-labor-department-opens-investigation-into-apple.2327395/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pBypGQfs6zE:FmU5xpW__9s:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pBypGQfs6zE:FmU5xpW__9s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"141f1652acce43556e452b7d0a5dafcaad346e7f90f127ceeeb55bd7a518b887","category":"Apple"}
