Your phone <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/google-says-the-pixel-8-will-get-its-new-ai-model-but-ram-usage-is-a-concern/\">has a lot less power</a>, but Google appears poised to give developers some important new mobile AI tools. At I/O next week, Google will likely announce a new set of APIs to let developers leverage the capabilities of Gemini Nano for on-device AI.</p>\n<p>Google has quietly published documentation on big new AI features for developers. According to <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-nano-ml-kit-genai-api-3558292/\">Android Authority</a>, an update to the ML Kit SDK will add API support for on-device generative AI features via Gemini Nano. It's built on AI Core, similar to the experimental Edge AI SDK, but it plugs into an existing model with a set of predefined features that should be easy for developers to implement.</p>\n<p>Google says ML Kitâ€™s GenAI APIs will enable apps to do summarization, proofreading, rewriting, and image description without sending data to the cloud. However, Gemini Nano doesn't have as much power as the cloud-based version, so expect some limitations. For example, Google notes that summaries can only have a maximum of three bullet points, and image descriptions will only be available in English. The quality of outputs could also vary based on the version of Gemini Nano on a phone. The standard version (Gemini Nano XS) is about 100MB in size, but Gemini Nano XXS <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/meager-8gb-of-ram-forces-pixel-9a-to-run-extra-extra-small-gemini-ai/\">as seen on the Pixel 9a</a> is a quarter of the size. It's text-only and has a much smaller context window.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/google-to-give-app-devs-access-to-gemini-nano-for-on-device-ai/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/google-to-give-app-devs-access-to-gemini-nano-for-on-device-ai/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2b718847466dc333dce5b3a3a7851ddb0f8771f9a1fcaf9157c1aaced51667f1","category":"Tech"}
