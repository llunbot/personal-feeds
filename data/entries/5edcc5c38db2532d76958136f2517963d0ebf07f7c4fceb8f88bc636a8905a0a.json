These updates mostly follow the template set by last year's M3 MacBook Pro refresh: there's a 14-inch $1,599 base model with the standard M4, and then beefed up 14- and 16-inch versions with the M4 Pro and M4 Max processors that also offer more RAM, storage, an optional nano-texture display finish, and other amenities for power users.</p>\n<p>All three versions of the M4 MacBook Pro are <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro\">available for preorder today</a> and begin arriving November 8, the same date as the new iMac and Mac mini refreshes.</p>\n<h2>New chips, same designs</h2>\n<p>Even without the M4's improvements, the new $1,599 MacBook Pro addresses the biggest gripe about the original: it upgrades the base model from 8GB to 16GB of RAM without increasing the price.
