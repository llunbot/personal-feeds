Chief among them is almost certain to be the <strong>iPhone 13</strong>, which is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348953/2021-apple-watch-series-7-design-display-features-release.html\">expected to bring several enhancements</a>, including a smaller notch, better camera features, and a faster processor.  It’s also rumored to have a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/357190/iphone-13-display-always-on-promotion-high-refresh.html\">new always-on feature</a> like the Apple Watch as well as a 120Hz ProMotion display for the Pro models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also likely arriving is a new <strong>Apple Watch Series 7</strong>, which <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348953/2021-apple-watch-series-7-design-display-features-release.html\">could bring a new design</a> with a bigger screen and flatter edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re also expecting <strong>third-gen AirPods</strong>, which <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349085/2021-airpods-pro-max-design-features-price-release.html\">could have a new design</a> as well.

There are also some features that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/353957/ios-15-features-missing-at-launch.html\">won’t quite be available at launch</a> but will arrive in a future update, including SharePlay, one of iOS 15’s marquee features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new version of watchOS will also arrive. watchOS 8 brings numerous new features, including smarter smart home integration, easier sharing, and a more powerful Wallet app, along with a new Mindfulness app.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Second event</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will reportedly hold <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/357409/second-fall-apple-event-to-reportedly-bring-macs-ipads.html\">a second fall event</a> in the coming weeks to unveil another round of new products.
