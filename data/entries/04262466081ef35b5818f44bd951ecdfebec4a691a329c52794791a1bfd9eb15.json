In his declaration, Cue asked the court to allow Apple to defend the deal by having its own witnesses testify during the trial.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Only Apple can speak to what kinds of future collaborations can best serve its users,\" wrote Cue. \"Apple is relentlessly focused on creating the best user experience possible and explores potential partnerships and arrangements with other companies to make that happen.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs part of the deal, Cue revealed that Google paid Apple roughly $20 billion in 2022 alone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf the agreement can no longer continue, Cue said \"it would hamstring Apple's ability to continue delivering products that best serve its users' needs.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe declaration was earlier <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-seeks-defend-googles-billion-dollar-payments-search-case-2024-12-24/\">reported <em>by Reuters</em></a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/24/apple-explains-why-it-wont-make-search-engine/\">Apple Explains Why It Doesn't Plan to Create a Search Engine</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explains-why-it-doesnt-plan-to-create-a-search-engine.2446055/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"04262466081ef35b5818f44bd951ecdfebec4a691a329c52794791a1bfd9eb15","category":"Apple"}
