Among these, phrases like \"Open TikTok Photos,\" \"Get TikTok Photos,\" and \"Share this post to TikTok Photos\" suggest direct connections between the existing video platform and the new photo-sharing app. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nTikTok has allowed users to post photo-based content in a video or carousel format for some time, but the app currently has no real alternative to dedicated photo-sharing social media platforms. TikTok Photos likely seeks to directly challenge Instagram's dominance in the photo-sharing space. Instagram has increasingly focused on video content, including Reels, in an effort to compete with TikTok's video dominance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe official launch date and regional availability of \"TikTok Photos\" is unknown, but the presence of extensive references to it within TikTok's code suggests that an announcement could be imminent.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/\">TikTok</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/new-tiktok-photos-app-spotted/\">All-New 'TikTok Photos' App Spotted, Likely to Be Instagram Rival</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-new-tiktok-photos-app-spotted-likely-to-be-instagram-rival.2421710/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3e7b4b563b7e7026f0512d39669dd15f71be4222730dc14ce200f54a39f55842","category":"Apple"}
