Sure, hydration bladders work, as well as “soft” canteens, bladders, Nalgene bottles, and standard cycling bottles, yet a bladder that is integrated into a framebag would be ideal. A few small companies have toyed with this concept but none have brought it to fruition, until now. Apidura just announced their new roll-top 1.5L bladder, specifically designed for full-frame bags thanks to its tapered design. This puts the water weight as close to the bottom bracket as possible, in an area that is often underutilized. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/apidura-innovation-lab-frame-pack-hydration-bladder-1.5l-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/apidura-innovation-lab-frame-pack-hydration-bladder-1.5l-product-presentation-poster.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Apidura has a full compatibility chart <a href=\"https://www.apidura.com/hydration-bladder/\" target=\"_blank\">on their website</a> but from the looks of things, the bladder will fit just about any full frame pack. Retail for this bladder is $51 and they’re in stock now at Apidura and your local dealer.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.apidura.com/shop/frame-pack-hydration-bladder/\" target=\"_blank\">Apidura</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"d969d5eced0437d62219a9186e980feffb0c944a82bd8a413e6376356498c9ec","category":"Cycling"}
