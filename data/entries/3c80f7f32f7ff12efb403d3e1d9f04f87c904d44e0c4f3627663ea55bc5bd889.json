Extending their cockpit partnership with Team DSM-Firmenich just for the time trial, Syncros developed a special version of their new monocoque carbon road wheels for TT racing – a combination of the deeper 60mm Capital Aero SL wheel up front and the lighter, shallower 40mm Capital SL in the rear with an ultralight carbon disc shell for maximum aerodynamics…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Syncros Capital SL time trial wheels for DSM at TdF TT</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-TT-Disc_full-carbon-monocoque-road-time-trial-wheels-for-DSM_photo-by-ElToroMedia_Disc-rear-wheel.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1850\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-TT-Disc_full-carbon-monocoque-road-time-trial-wheels-for-DSM_photo-by-ElToroMedia_Disc-rear-wheel.jpg\" alt=\"Syncros Capital SL TT Disc, full-carbon monocoque road time trial wheels for DSM, photo by El Toro Media, custom Disc rear wheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-TT-Disc_full-carbon-monocoque-road-time-trial-wheels-for-DSM_photo-by-ElToroMedia_Disc-rear-wheel.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-TT-Disc_full-carbon-monocoque-road-time-trial-wheels-for-DSM_photo-by-ElToroMedia_Disc-rear-wheel-297x275.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-TT-Disc_full-carbon-monocoque-road-time-trial-wheels-for-DSM_photo-by-ElToroMedia_Disc-rear-wheel-800x740.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-TT-Disc_full-carbon-monocoque-road-time-trial-wheels-for-DSM_photo-by-ElToroMedia_Disc-rear-wheel-120x111.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-TT-Disc_full-carbon-monocoque-road-time-trial-wheels-for-DSM_photo-by-ElToroMedia_Disc-rear-wheel-768x710.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Syncros-Capital-SL-TT-Disc_full-carbon-monocoque-road-time-trial-wheels-for-DSM_photo-by-ElToroMedia_Disc-rear-wheel-1536x1421.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c.

The special edition Syncros Capital SL TT wheelset includes a standard 590g Capital Aero SL 60mm front wheel and a custom-built Capital SL Disc wheel at a claimed 970g. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Together, that’s apparently a full 500g weight savings in wheels vs. DSM’s previous TT setup.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That Capital SL Disc wheel is actually a 40mm deep Capital SL wheel, wrapped in a pair of carbon shells to create the disc, making it one of the lightest and stiffest disc time trial wheels in the pro peloton.

Syncros has custom-made the Syncros Capital SL TT wheelset for Team DSM to race for the remainder of this season, so that special Capital SL Disc rear wheel is not yet commercially available.
