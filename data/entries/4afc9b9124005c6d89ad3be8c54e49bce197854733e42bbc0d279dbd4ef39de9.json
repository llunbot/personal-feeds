The flagship is the Moto Razr+, which will launch in the US on June 23 for $999. There's also a cheaper phone called only the \"Moto Razr\" with a smaller outside screen, slower SoC, and no clear US price or release date. Internationally, these phones are called the Moto Razr 40 Ultra and Moto Razr 40.</p>\n<p>The Ultra model's SoC is a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1—that's not the best you can get from Qualcomm, which would be the 8 Gen 2—this is a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/qualcomms-snapdragon-8-gen-1-salvage-operation-moves-the-chip-to-tsmc/\">year-old mid-cycle</a> upgrade chip. The phone has 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a 3800 mAh battery with 30 W quick charging. The leaked display specs have been all over the place, but officially, the interior display is a 6.9-inch, 2640×1080 OLED that runs at a smoking 165 Hz. The exterior display is super big on the Ultra model and is a 3.6-inch, 144 Hz OLED at a nearly square 1066×1056. Motorola has the phone's dust and water ingress protection rated at IP52, which <a href=\"https://rainfordsolutions.com/products/ingress-protection-ip-rated-enclosures/ip-enclosure-ratings-standards-explained/\">typically only</a> protects from \"direct sprays of water up to 15 degrees from the vertical\" and is far from qualifying the Razr as a water-resistant phone.</p>\n<p>The design has been better. The<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/04/moto-razr-review-rip-to-our-moto-razr-march-30-2020-march-31-2020/\"> original foldable Moto Razr</a> reboot from 2020 had beautiful throwback looks that screamed \"Moto Razr.\" It looked just like the old-school flip phone from the early 2000s but modernized. This fourth foldable generation tones things down a lot and is more of a generic rectangle. You could easily confuse it for Samsung's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-4-gets-a-bit-wider-keeps-1799-price-tag/\">Galaxy Z Flip</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943768#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943768&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4afc9b9124005c6d89ad3be8c54e49bce197854733e42bbc0d279dbd4ef39de9","category":"Tech"}
