Until then, connecting your phone to your car meant bothering with Bluetooth, and if you wanted to use a smartphone navigation app, you probably needed some kind of phone holder clipped to an air vent or suction-cupped to the dashboard. Being able to cast your phone's screen to the car's infotainment system turned out to be extremely popular, and by 2020, it was a feature that <a href=\"https://www.autopacific.com/autopacific-insights/2020/1/15/nearly-half-of-new-car-buyers-want-their-smart-phone-to-display-in-their-vehicle\">almost half of all new car buyers wanted</a>.</p>\n<p>This has not sat well with every automaker; in March of this year, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/gm-kills-more-than-carplay-support-it-kills-choice/#:~:text=Today%2C%20news%20dropped%20that%20GM,real%20estate%20in%20its%20vehicles.\">General Motors made headlines</a>—and generated a lot of comments—when it announced it was killing off support for casting interfaces (both CarPlay and Android Auto) from its future products.
