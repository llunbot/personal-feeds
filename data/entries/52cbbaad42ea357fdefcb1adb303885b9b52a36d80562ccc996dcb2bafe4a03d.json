We’re also right on schedule for the M4 generation of MacBook Airs, but I don’t think MacBook Airs would qualify for “newest member of the family”. They’re more like an updated version of the current member of the family. But the next-gen iPhone SE is going to be a very different iPhone SE — it will mark the end of the Home button and Touch ID. Maybe it won’t even be named “SE” but given a new name?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/cook-x-product-launch\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"52cbbaad42ea357fdefcb1adb303885b9b52a36d80562ccc996dcb2bafe4a03d","category":"Tech"}
