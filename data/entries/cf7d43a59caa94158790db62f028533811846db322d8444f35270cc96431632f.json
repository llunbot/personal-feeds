The line appears white while your phone is out of level and then turns yellow once you achieve a level orientation to indicate success.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-camera-level.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" />\r<br />\nThe leveling pop-up only appears for a brief time and only within a narrow range of angles close to horizontal (in either portrait or landscape orientation), so it's not intrusively popping up when you're intentionally trying to take a photo at an angle.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-camera-level-setting.jpg\" alt width=\"1284\" height=\"834\" />\r<br />\nThe new option appears to be off by default if you don't have Grid mode turned on before upgrading, but is on by default if you're already a Grid mode user. The option can be toggled in the Camera section of the Settings app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Level feature is just one of a number of enhancements to photos in ‌iOS 17‌, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/ios-17-zoom-crop-option/\">one-tap cropping</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/ios-17-photos-recognizes-pets/\">pet recognition</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/ios-17-animated-stickers/\">animated sticker creation</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/ios-17-tidbits-whats-new/\">Visual Lookup for recipes from photos</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, Jake!)</em><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/07/ios-17-camera-level/\">iOS 17 Camera App Can Help Straighten Your Shooting Angle</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-camera-app-can-help-straighten-your-shooting-angle.2392066/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cf7d43a59caa94158790db62f028533811846db322d8444f35270cc96431632f","category":"Apple"}
