{"title":"iPhone 12 Pro Max Seeing Strong Demand in U.S. as Consumer Spending Rises","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/15/iphone-12-sales-june-2021-quarter-cirp/","date":1626358569000,"content":"The <a href=\"https://files.constantcontact.com/150f9af2201/11deb0c6-5485-42de-acdd-a8cd41e2e107.pdf\">latest research</a> from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) shows that all four iPhone 12 models accounted for 63% of total iPhone sales in the United States in the quarter ending June 2021.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/apple-store-iphone-12-customers.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe highest-end iPhone 12 Pro Max tied with the year-old iPhone 11 for the largest share of any single model at 23%, while the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone XR had the smallest share, each at 5%, according to CIRP. As pandemic-related restrictions ease in the United States, the Chicago-based research firm said increased consumer spending correlated with consumers shifting to more expensive iPhone models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"Apple did very well as it emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Josh Lowitz, a CIRP co-founder. \"Increased consumer spending correlated with consumers shifting to more expensive iPhone models as they retired older phones and shopped more at Apple's own retail locations to buy those iPhones.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/cirp-iphone-12-3q21.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe shift to more expensive models resulted in the iPhone's average selling price in the United States rising to $869 in the June 2021 quarter, added Lowitz.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe research note also indicates that Apple experienced a significant increase in iPhone sales through its retail operations, including both physical stores and online. In the June 2021 quarter, 27% of iPhone sales in the United States were completed through Apple, compared to a previous high of 21% in September 2020, according to CIRP.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCIRP bases its findings on its survey of 500 customers in the United States who purchased an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch in the April-June 2021 period.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cirp/\">CIRP</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12\">iPhone 12 (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12-Pro\">iPhone 12 Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/15/iphone-12-sales-june-2021-quarter-cirp/\">iPhone 12 Pro Max Seeing Strong Demand in U.S. as Consumer Spending Rises</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-12-pro-max-seeing-strong-demand-in-u-s-as-consumer-spending-rises.2304345/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ph-T8i6mOp8:Bqm-ksgrv4U:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ph-T8i6mOp8:Bqm-ksgrv4U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ph-T8i6mOp8\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6382619c1ae6d54de0d105974fc494436b1acd87bfd58c62f2ee9afbc3ad76c7","category":"Apple"}
