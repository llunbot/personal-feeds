Her path back to the podium wasn’t an easy one. After winning gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Rissveds took a break from the sport, sighting burnout and other health issues. With this time away from the sport, Rissveds started her own team with a unique focus called <a href=\"https://team31.org/\">Team31</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Team31 explains the inception story on their site, <em>“The personal journey of Olympic Champion Jenny Rissveds inspired the creation of Team31. After overcoming a personal battle with eating disorders and depression, which caused her to leave cycling, she has returned to the sport and become a major proponent for mental health.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rissveds and Team 31 grew, becoming Team31-IBIS and eventually, she was back at the front of World Cup races, rarely out of podium contention. Rissveds continues to be one of the most captivating figures in world mountain biking.  With multiple World Cup victories and national titles to her name, the 30-year-old from Falun, Sweden, is ready for her next chapter. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I’m pleased about this new career phase,” she shared. “Joining the Canyon CLLCTV feels like the perfect opportunity to grow as a rider and continue pushing my limits.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jenny Rissveds</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CLLCTV-Factory-XC-Team-Nora--scaled-e1736270715338.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1706\" height=\"1036\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CLLCTV-Factory-XC-Team-Nora--scaled-e1736270715338.webp\" alt=\"CLLCTV Factory XC Team Nora\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CLLCTV-Factory-XC-Team-Nora--scaled-e1736270715338.webp 1706w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CLLCTV-Factory-XC-Team-Nora--scaled-e1736270715338-297x180.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CLLCTV-Factory-XC-Team-Nora--scaled-e1736270715338-1536x933.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CLLCTV-Factory-XC-Team-Nora--scaled-e1736270715338-120x73.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CLLCTV-Factory-XC-Team-Nora--scaled-e1736270715338-768x466.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blending Experience and Next-Gen Talent</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rissveds joins an impressive roster that balances seasoned professionals and emerging talents.
