To support this, OpenAI pointed to a single November 2020 article, where the NYT reported that OpenAI was analyzing a trillion words on the Internet. But on Friday, US district judge Sidney Stein disagreed, denying OpenAI's motion to dismiss the NYT's copyright claims partly based on one NYT journalist's reporting.</p>\n<p>In his <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NYT-v-OpenAI-Opinion-4-4-25.pdf\">opinion</a>, Stein confirmed that it's OpenAI's burden to prove that the NYT knew that ChatGPT would potentially violate its copyrights two years prior to its release in November 2022. And so far, OpenAI has not met that burden.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/judge-doesnt-buy-openai-argument-nyts-own-reporting-weakens-copyright-suit/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/judge-doesnt-buy-openai-argument-nyts-own-reporting-weakens-copyright-suit/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1fcc866c093a291cbab7c0d2140c6c88ee4cc8b382e534317e8691df29358a8b","category":"Tech"}
