We're five months removed from the launch of the Pixel 8, and that doesn't seem like a justifiable position anymore: Google says its latest AI models can't run on the Pixel 8.</p>\n<p>Google dropped that news in a Mobile World Congress wrap-up video that was spotted by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1765812906896113681\">Mishaal Rahman</a>. At the end of the show in a Q&amp;A session, Googler Terence Zhang, a member of the Gemini-on-Android team, said \"[Gemini] Nano will not be coming to the Pixel 8 because of some hardware limitations. It's currently on the Pixel 8 Pro and very recently available on the Samsung S24 family. It'll be coming to more high-end devices in the near future.\"</p>\n<p>That is a wild statement. Gemini is Google's latest AI model, and it made a<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/google-debuts-more-powerful-ultra-1-0-ai-model-in-rebranded-gemini-chatbot/\"> big deal</a> of the launch last month. Gemini comes in a few different sizes, and the smallest \"Nano\" size is specifically designed to run on smartphones as a much-hyped \"on-device AI.\" The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are Google's flagship smartphones. Google designed the phone and the chip and the AI model and somehow can't make these things play nice together?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008918#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008918&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4a568d367ecabce9ef3066bf6d25b548eef14f4ec89bd81dffcc6e9a269afe27","category":"Tech"}
