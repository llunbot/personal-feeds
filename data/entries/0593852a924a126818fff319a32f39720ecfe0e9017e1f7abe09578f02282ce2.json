Compared to the Samsung Galaxy S21+, both iPhones are however significantly more expensive to build.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/iphone-13-pro-costs-breakdown.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe increase in build costs from the ‌iPhone 12‌ Pro to the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ is notable but not as pronounced as last year's increase from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a>. The ‌iPhone 12‌ introduced 5G support, a new 5nm chip, and the return of flat edges. Those changes resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/iphone-12-fifth-costlier-than-iphone-11/\">iPhone 12 being 21% more expensive</a> for Apple to build than the ‌iPhone 11‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the run-up to the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> and ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ last month, a report suggested that due to increased costs for chip production, Apple would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/26/iphone-13-price-increase-chip-production/\">increase the price of the iPhone 13</a> as a means of compensating. That did not occur, and Apple instead kept the same price points for the ‌iPhone 13‌, on top of introducing more aggressive carrier subsidies. Another report suggested that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/12/new-iphone-camera-assembly-method/\">looking at new ways to assemble the cameras</a> in an ‌iPhone‌ to save costs.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-13-Pro\">iPhone 13 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/04/iphone-13-pro-costs-breakdown-iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro Costs Around $20 More to Build Compared to the iPhone 12 Pro, Despite Being the Same Price for the Customer</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-pro-costs-around-20-more-to-build-compared-to-the-iphone-12-pro-despite-being-the-same-price-for-the-customer.2315283/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=v6ll5o9cF2M:hGA-qJY2Ymg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=v6ll5o9cF2M:hGA-qJY2Ymg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/v6ll5o9cF2M\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0593852a924a126818fff319a32f39720ecfe0e9017e1f7abe09578f02282ce2","category":"Apple"}
