Currently, the Vision Pro starts at $3,499 in the U.S., and this price has naturally limited sales of the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn an interview earlier this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/tim-cook-admits-truth-about-vision-pro/\">acknowledged that the Vision Pro is not a mass-market product</a> due to its high price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"At $3,500, it's not a mass-market product,\" said Cook. \"Right now, it's an early-adopter product. People who want to have tomorrow's technology todayâ€”that's who it's for. Fortunately, there's enough people who are in that camp that it's exciting.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn July, research firm IDC estimated that Vision Pro sales would be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/apple-vision-pro-under-500000-sales-this-year/\">below 500,000 units this year</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the next Vision Pro could be at least slightly more affordable, TrendForce ensured that the device will continue to have high-end specifications, including display technology with a resolution exceeding 3,000 pixels per inch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to a Vision Pro price cut, a lower-end model is also expected eventually.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor this mainstream Vision headset, the research firm said that Apple is expected to focus on \"affordability and \"cost-efficiency\" as a main priority, which should make visionOS accessible to more customers at a considerably lower price compared to the Vision Pro. It said the device could have less-advanced displays to keep costs down.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Possible display options for this model include glass-based OLED displays and LCDs with LTPO backplane technology, both of which offer a balance between performance and cost,\" said TrendForce, in a press release.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo last month said the next Vision Pro will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/apple-vision-pro-with-m5-chip-rumor/\">actually launch in 2025, with an M5 chip</a> in place of the current M2 chip, but he said Apple pushed back its plans for a cheaper Vision headset until beyond 2027.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/\">TrendForce</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/19/vision-pro-affordability/\">Apple Likely to Make Vision Pro Lineup More Affordable in Two Ways</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-to-make-vision-pro-lineup-more-affordable-in-two-ways.2445783/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e3c0fa18099fe30b49a64c6248cbbcf20cba1cb5d57f7c683243ab9e35c91aad","category":"Apple"}
