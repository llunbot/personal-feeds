That's the entire point of the <a href=\"https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher\">OpenCore Legacy Patcher</a>, a community-driven project that supports old Macs by combining some repurposed Hackintosh projects with older system files extracted from past macOS versions.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, the OCLP team announced <a href=\"https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/releases/tag/1.0.0\">version 1.0.0 of the software</a>, the first to formally support the recently released <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/macos-14-sonoma-the-ars-technica-review/\">macOS 14 Sonoma</a>. Although Sonoma officially supports Macs released mostly in 2018 or later, the OCLP project will allow Sonoma to install on Macs that go back to models released in 2007 and 2008, enabling them to keep up with at least some of the new features and security patches baked into the latest release.</p>\n<p>But OCLP supports some Macs better than others, and generally, the older your Mac is, the more problems you will have.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972615#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972615&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"460eb0da95038530a8c4737e48c43dd18b635fc12f7ca52433b2991468cc4670","category":"Tech"}
