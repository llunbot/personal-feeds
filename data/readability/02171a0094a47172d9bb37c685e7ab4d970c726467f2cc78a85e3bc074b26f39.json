The combination of Boa and Velcro for closure means your foot is firmly ensconced in the shoe no matter what happens on the ride. While it has a narrower fit, the upper isn’t unforgiving, making it a comfortable long ride shoe. And it’s racy enough for XC riders looking for performance but has enough give in the sole that it still feels beginner-friendly. In short, it’s a well-balanced shoe.</p><p>Its pricing falls in the mid-range as well: At $240, you’re getting most of the benefits of a higher-end shoe. It’s been around for a while, and while a basic black option is available, Giro also releases different colorways depending on what colors are trending. Cyclocrossers can rejoice, too: This shoe has spots to screw in toe spikes for muddy races.</p><ul><li>Type: Clipless</li><li>Closure system: Boa and Velcro</li><li>Sole: Nylon and rubber</li><li>Sizes: 36 to 43 in whole sizes</li><li>Price: $240</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Comfortable while still being race-ready<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Pricey for beginners<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;<strong>BEST HIGH-END WOMEN’S MTB SHOE</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fsidi-drako-2-srs-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sidi Drako 2 SRS&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes.jpg\" alt=\"sidi drako best women's mtb shoes\" width=\"1600\" height=\"935\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-297x174.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-800x468.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-120x70.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-768x449.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-1536x898.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-696x407.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-1068x624.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-719x420.jpg 719w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-297x174.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-800x468.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-120x70.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-768x449.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-1536x898.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-696x407.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-1068x624.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105057/sidi-drako-best-womens-mtb-shoes-719x420.jpg 719w\"></a></p><p>This shoe has incredible stiffness and power transfer on the bike. It mimics a carbon road shoe. The shoe fits closely to your foot, making it ideal for somebody with a narrow foot. The Boa adjustments provide the opportunity to get a great customized fit.</p><p>However, this shoe is not ideal for mountain bike riding, where you may need to hike a bike. It is ultra-stiff and thus not comfortable walking over rocks and non-rideable technical sections. It mimics ice skating on wet rocky trails if you have to come off the bike. Overall, this is a great shoe for fast, single-track riding—just less beginner-friendly.</p><p>We also appreciate that with Sidi, most of the pieces of the shoe that tend to break are replaceable. You can order replacement boas, plates for your cleats, and other attachments on Sidi’s website.</p><ul><li>Style: Clipless</li><li>Closure system: Boa</li><li>Sole: Carbon</li><li>Sizes: 38-43</li><li>Colors: White</li><li>MSRP: $500</li></ul><p><strong>PROS:&nbsp;</strong>Superb power transfer<br><strong>CONS: </strong>Walking is challenging, expensive<br></p><h3><span>&nbsp;<strong>BEST WOMEN’S MTB SHOE FOR TIGHT BUDGETS</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fnorthwave-genetix-plus-2-wide-mountain-bike-shoe-mens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Northwave Genetix Plus 2&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes.jpg\" alt=\"NORTHWAVE GENETIX PLUS 2 best womens mtb shoes\" width=\"1600\" height=\"833\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-297x155.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-800x417.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-120x62.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-768x400.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-1536x800.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-696x362.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-1068x556.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-807x420.jpg 807w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-297x155.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-800x417.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-120x62.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-768x400.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-1536x800.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-696x362.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-1068x556.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12105044/NORTHWAVE-GENETIX-PLUS-2-best-womens-mtb-shoes-807x420.jpg 807w\"></a></p><p>First, a caveat: Northwave doesn’t actually make women-specific shoes, so these are unisex. But we didn’t want to exclude a great budget option that works well for women just because of how it’s marketed. We were impressed with just how slick these shoes look and feel at first glance: Often, budget shoes have just velcro straps, but these have a velcro strap plus a Boa. The upper also looks higher quality than many bargain options.</p><p>The sole is much stiffer than many cheaper shoe options, thanks to the Northwave Speedlight 3D carbon composite that’s less pricey than a typical carbon sole but is significantly stiffer than other options. The fit is extremely comfortable, thanks to a Boa dial that makes micro-adjustments and stays in place. However, the sizing can be tricky, so you may want to order two and return one if you’re not positive about your size.

Whether you race XC or cyclocross or just want to go fast on the trails, these shoes are comfortable while still being race-worthy.</p><p>“My feet were tingling and hurt while riding. I used Lake’s online foot measurement tool and found I needed a wide size. Ordered them. Problem solved,” says one rider. For women with wide feet, often unisex shoes are the best option. But plenty of women have higher arches and a narrower heel with a slightly wider toe box, and Lake shoes take that into account.</p><p>Note: If you have wide feet, we recommend opting for the unisex version of this shoe or even the wide unisex option. The women’s wide fit is great for someone who wants a bit more wiggle room, but extra-wide feet may be more comfortable in other versions. Use their online measuring to get the right size!</p><ul><li>Style: Clipless</li><li>Closure system: Boas</li><li>Sole: Rubber</li><li>Sizes: 37-43</li><li>Colors: Black, blue camo</li><li>MSRP:

As a rider with a slightly wider foot and the need to be comfortable for 10+ hours of racing, finding a shoe that was just right for her was critical. The Recon 3.0s have plenty of space, and the fit is easily and widely adjustable thanks to two Boas and a Velcro closure.</p><p>The heel and tongue area have great cushioning, and the toe box is the ideal width. There is enough room for your toes not to feel cramped, but your foot doesn’t swim around like some shoes with a wide toe box.</p><p>We like the shoe blend of stiffness—critical for good power output in long gravel grinders—and comfort. The soles are designed for great traction if you are off the bike and walking, and the shape of the shoe helps to avoid dreaded hot spots on your feet.</p><p>The only drawback is that the fabric covering the padding around the heel and ankle wore quickly, but this resulted from high usage.

Typically, women’s cycling shoes run a bit narrower than men’s/unisex options and come in smaller sizes. So if you have a skinny foot or need a small size, you may need women’s MTB shoes. But you may want to consider men’s options if you don’t have a narrow foot since the fit is similar, but the pricing/colors/styles might be more to your liking.</p><p><strong>Decide on how you want to ride</strong>. If you’re a downhill/enduro type of MTBer, flat shoes are for you. If you’re more into XC MTB, cyclocross, gravel riding, or even casual road riding or spin classes, shoes for clipless pedals are the right call.</p><p><strong>Measure your feet carefully</strong>. Some brands have weird sizing, so it’s best to know the exact length of your foot to compare with their size charts. When in doubt, message the company and ask for advice. Or check that the company has free returns, and order the two pairs that you think might work.</p><p><strong>Make sure you try the shoes on with the socks you’ll be riding in. It sounds</strong>&nbsp;minor, but cycling socks versus regular socks can make a difference in how shoes fit.</p><p><strong>Walk and ride to test.</strong> Even if you’re not planning to spend a lot of your time hiking your bike, you likely will walk at some point. So find a shoe that feels relatively comfortable while walking as well as riding. This is especially important for cyclocrossers!</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4.jpeg\" alt=\"Best women's MTB shoes: Specialized\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1083\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4.jpeg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4-297x201.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4-800x542.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4-120x81.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4-768x520.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4-1536x1040.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4.jpeg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4-297x201.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4-800x542.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4-120x81.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4-768x520.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100151/best-womens-mtb-shoes-4-1536x1040.jpeg 1536w\"></a></p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p><strong>What do I need MTB shoes for?</strong><br>Other than the obvious—namely, mountain biking—MTB shoes have other uses.

More casual riders and those in gravity disciplines like downhill may prefer flat shoes.</p><div id=\"attachment_253095\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-253095\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two.jpg\" alt=\"best women's MTB shoe: specialized rime flat \" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16131519/Specialized-rime-flat-pedal-mtb-shoes-review-fanderson-two-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-253095\">Flat shoes make it easy to put a foot down and are ideal for downhill or enduro-style MTB riding.</p></div><p><strong>Can I wear sneakers if using flat pedals?</strong><br>You may find that regular sneakers work just fine as mountain bike shoes when used with flat pedals when you are getting started. But as you progress, you’ll likely want to swap to bike-specific flat shoes, which have a rubber sole that’s stickier than your average shoe to stay more firmly attached to the pedals. The rubber is also more durable, so the small pins in your pedals that help keep your feet in place won’t damage them.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2.jpeg\" alt=\"Best women's MTB shoe: Sidi \" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2.jpeg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2-297x223.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2-800x600.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2-120x90.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2-768x576.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2.jpeg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2-297x223.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2-800x600.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2-120x90.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2-768x576.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/01100159/best-womens-mtb-shoes-2-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w\"></a></p><p><strong>How should the best women’s MTB shoes fit?</strong><br>Think about a running shoe and aim for that kind of feeling: Snug enough that your foot isn’t sliding around at all, but not so tight that your toes are crunched, or you can’t wiggle them slightly. Because mountain biking typically includes spending time off the bike, a shoe that feels comfortable to walk (or run if you’re racing) is important. We like shoes like Sidi’s (above) that offer multiple ways to adjust sizing.</p><p><strong>Do I need carbon soles?</strong><br>It depends on the type of riding you’re hoping to do, but most recreational mountain bikers won’t need the added stiffness that carbon provides. If you are doing a lot of pedaling, though, that stiffness will help you waste less energy. Rubber will bend slightly with every pedal stroke, reducing the force transferred to the drivetrain.</p><p><strong>Do I need women-specific shoes?</strong><br>No. Some riders may find them more comfortable, though.</p><p><strong>Can I use mountain bike shoes as road shoes?</strong><br>Definitely. You may lose a bit of power in the transfer because they’re not as stiff. But most riders will be fine.</p><div id=\"attachment_251994\"><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-251994\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes.jpg\" alt=\"best women's MTB shoes: SPD cleats\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mountain-bike-pedal-cleats-and-xc-trail-mtb-shoes-265x198.jpg 265w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-251994\">Are you struggling to stay clipped in?
