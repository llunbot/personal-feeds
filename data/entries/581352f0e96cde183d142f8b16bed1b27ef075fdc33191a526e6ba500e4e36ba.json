{"title":"Ars Live: What else can GLP-1 drugs do? Join us Tuesday for a discussion.","link":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/ars-live-join-us-tuesday-as-we-discuss-glp-1-drugs-insights-and-unknowns/","date":1729891092000,"content":"<p>News and talk of GLP-1 drugs are everywhere these daysâ€”from their smash success in treating Type 2 diabetes and obesity to their astronomical pricing, drug shortages, compounding disputes, and what sometimes seems like an ever-growing list of other conditions the drugs could potentially treat. There are new headlines every day.</p>\n<p>However, while the drugs have abruptly stolen the spotlight in recent years, researchers have been toiling away at developing and understanding them for decades, stretching back to the 1970s. And even since they were developed, the drugs still have held mysteries and unknowns. For instance, researchers thought for years that they worked directly in the gut to decrease blood sugar levels and make people feel full. After all, the drugs mimic an incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1, that does exactly that. But, instead, studies have since found that they work in the brain.</p>\n<p>In fact, the molecular receptors for GLP-1 are sprinkled in many places around the body. They're found in the central nervous system, the heart, blood vessels, liver, and kidney. Their presence in the brain even plays a role in inflammation. As such, research on GLP-1 continues to flourish as scientists work to understand the role it could play in treating a range of other chronic conditions.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/ars-live-join-us-tuesday-as-we-discuss-glp-1-drugs-insights-and-unknowns/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/ars-live-join-us-tuesday-as-we-discuss-glp-1-drugs-insights-and-unknowns/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"581352f0e96cde183d142f8b16bed1b27ef075fdc33191a526e6ba500e4e36ba","category":"Tech"}
