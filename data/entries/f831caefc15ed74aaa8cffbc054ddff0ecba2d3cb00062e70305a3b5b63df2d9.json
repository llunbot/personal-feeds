Nokia and Apple have not announced the terms of the deal, but Nokia will be receiving payments from Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNokia owns more than 20,000 patents, including 5,500 patents that are related to 5G technology. Nokia offers its patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms because many of them are considered essential. This means that companies can license Nokia technologies for a reasonable price, but there are sometimes disputes over the definition of reasonable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBack in 2017, Apple and Nokia established a new patent licensing agreement <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/23/apple-nokia-settle-legal-dispute-patent-agreement/\">following a heated legal dispute</a>, and that 2017 agreement was set to expire in 2023.
