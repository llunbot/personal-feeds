Woodworth’s journey began with a competitive ski racing career in Europe and for the US Ski Team. After finding her calling in design and fashion, Woodworth worked on New York Fashion Week runway shows and designed costumes for pop icon Lady Gaga and alongside Marc Jacobs. However, a deep-seated love for the outdoors and a desire to create functional, stylish apparel led Woodworth to move to Ventura, California and transition her focus to outdoor apparel and Advanced Concept design at Patagonia. After a decade on the coast, Woodworth settled down in Bozeman, Montana to be closer to the mountains and launch Curious Creatures.</p>\n<p>Woodworth’s fifteen years of design experience further honed her creative philosophy, emphasizing sustainability, quality, and product testing rooted in personal experiences. Now, as the founder of Curious Creatures, Woodworth brings her passion for adventure and design to the forefront, infusing each piece with a sense of humor, expression, and fun. “Design is more than aesthetics; it’s about creating products that seamlessly merge performance and self-expression. At Curious Creatures, we’re committed to pushing the boundaries of mountain bike apparel, ensuring riders feel comfortable, confident, and connected to nature.” The first collection is focused on the needs of women with designs and styles crafted with women in mind first. There are also cross-over pieces that cater to men and as the line expands so will the options for all genders.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-100.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-100.jpg?w=2400&amp;quality=75 2400w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-100.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-100.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-100.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-100.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-100.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-100.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-100.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-100.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1602\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-368.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-368.jpg?w=2400&amp;quality=75 2400w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-368.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-368.jpg?resize=2000,1335&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-368.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-368.jpg?resize=1800,1202&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-368.jpg?resize=1335,891&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-368.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-368.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Lhittmeier_CuriousCreatures_BigSky2023-368.jpg?resize=2048,1367&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>The Curious Creatures logo tells the story of the brand’s essence – an amalgamation of curiosity, exploration, and a touch of whimsy. Inspired by a transformative bikepacking trip, the logo incorporates elements that symbolize the brand’s spirit – the letter “C,” to represent the name, playful seeing googly eyes for creatures of the outdoors, the indelible imprint of bike tires, and a subtle nod to the natural world. “The brand’s credence in conscientious design, sustainability and craftsmanship are at the heart of everything we create from the logo and design to the fabric, fit and innovation,” says Woodworth.</p>\n<p>As a design-led company, Curious Creatures works with manufacturers that support innovation in renewable energy and positive treatment of workers. The company has partnered with a local Montana repair shop to ensure there is the ability to repair goods and keep them in use for as long as possible.</p>\n<p>To learn more about <a href=\"https://wearecuriouscreatures.com/pages/responsibility\" target=\"_blank\">responsibility and ethics</a>, or view the <a href=\"https://wearecuriouscreatures.com/blogs/lookbooks/big-sky-look-book\" target=\"_blank\">lookbook</a> visit Curious Creatures’ website.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/curious-creatures-apparel-review/\">Introducing Curious Creatures: A Fresh Approach to Mountain Bike Apparel That Celebrates Individuality and Adventure</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Hailey Moore","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"d306fa6ff9d4105d0e2182889ef58c4600103a90db78ff954ca089121240e352","category":"Cycling"}
