A total of 14 members of Ive's former design team at Apple have now left the company. Only around six designers who once reported to Ive still remain at Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIve took more Apple designers with him to LoveFrom than remain at Apple. To date, more than 20 former Apple employees have joined Ive's new design firm, including Marc Newson and Shota Aoyagi.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em> says that Ive's work for OpenAI marks one of his \"most ambitious efforts\" since he left Apple, and he apparently hopes to turn the work into a new company, with current efforts focused on hiring talent and creating concepts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt Apple, Tang Tan is vice president of product design and reports to senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus. Tan is responsible for the design of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, Apple Watch, accessories, and acoustic devices like AirPods.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTan will lead hardware engineering on the OpenAI project while working at LoveFrom. Little is known about OpenAI's hardware ambitions, but <em>Bloomberg</em> claims that projects in the concept stage include devices for the home. Tan officially departs Apple in February, but his responsibilities have already been divided up among successors.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jony-ive/\">Jony Ive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lovefrom/\">LoveFrom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/another-apple-designer-to-work-on-openai-hardware/\">Another Apple Designer Joins Jony Ive to Work on Hardware for OpenAI</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/another-apple-designer-joins-jony-ive-to-work-on-hardware-for-openai.2414765/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1d9cff980c03a8dbd1576167449e240d965d1245cd1bb86424da7bdbfd16f991","category":"Apple"}
