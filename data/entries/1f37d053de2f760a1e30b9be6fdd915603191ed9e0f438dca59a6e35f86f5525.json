The research tested eight AI-driven search tools equipped with live search functionality and discovered that the AI models incorrectly answered more than 60 percent of queries about news sources.</p>\n<p>Researchers Klaudia Jaźwińska and Aisvarya Chandrasekar noted in their report that roughly 1 in 4 Americans now uses AI models as alternatives to traditional search engines. This raises serious concerns about reliability, given the substantial error rate uncovered in the study.</p>\n<p>Error rates varied notably among the tested platforms. Perplexity provided incorrect information in 37 percent of the queries tested, whereas <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/openai-launches-chatgpt-with-search-taking-google-head-on/\">ChatGPT Search</a> incorrectly identified 67 percent (134 out of 200) of articles queried. Grok 3 demonstrated the highest error rate, at 94 percent.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-search-engines-give-incorrect-answers-at-an-alarming-60-rate-study-says/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-search-engines-give-incorrect-answers-at-an-alarming-60-rate-study-says/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1f37d053de2f760a1e30b9be6fdd915603191ed9e0f438dca59a6e35f86f5525","category":"Tech"}
