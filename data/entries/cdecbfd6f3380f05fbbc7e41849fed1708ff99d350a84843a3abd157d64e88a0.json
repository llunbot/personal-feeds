It was considered cool for ‘serious’ roadies to rid their bikes of headset spacers, cut down the steerer tube on the fork and even resort to negative rise stems to get a ‘pro’ riding position – comfort be damned.</p>\n<p>I can only imagine the number of good bikes ruined by that daft trend.</p>\n<p>These kinds of stretched-out, aerodynamic riding positions might make sense for professional athletes.

A full-on aero road bike may look fast leaning up outside the coffee stop, but if it makes you wince every time you turn the pedals you won’t be fast while riding.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes/\">Endurance road bikes</a>, on the other hand, typically use taller stacks and a shorter reach, putting the bars and controls within easier range.</p>\n<p>This can not only help reduce fatigue and lessen the likelihood of discomfort or injury, but can also enable you to make better use of the drops on your handlebar, for improved descending control and aerodynamics.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Warren Rossiter riding a Cannondale Synapse LTD RLE endurance all-road bike.\" title=\"Warren Rossiter riding a Cannondale Synapse LTD RLE endurance all-road bike.\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Calmer handling and a more forgiving ride position make endurance road bikes easier to ride faster for longer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Aside from your ride position, endurance bikes have handling geometries designed to meet the needs of non-pro riders too.</p>\n<p>The most obvious change is often an elongated wheelbase (the distance between the centre of each wheel on the bike), because endurance bikes tend to have larger tyre clearances.</p>\n<p>A longer wheelbase makes a bike feel more stable and less twitchy, which is especially useful for confident riding at high speeds, such as when descending.</p>\n<p>Whilst previous endurance road bikes tended to slacken the head angle to slow down the steering, the latest generation of modern endurance bikes keeps to the race bike standard of 72.5 to 73.5 degrees, with some even having similarly racy trail figures too.</p>\n<p>Trail shows the front tyre’s contact point ‘trailing’ behind the steering axis.
