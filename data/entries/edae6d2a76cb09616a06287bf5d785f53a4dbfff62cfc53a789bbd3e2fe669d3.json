But nobody really remembers much before the age of 4, because nearly all humans experience what's termed \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_amnesia\">infantile amnesia</a>,\" in which memories that might have formed before that age seemingly vanish as we move through adolescence. And it's not just us; the phenomenon appears to occur in a number of our fellow mammals.</p>\n<p>The simplest explanation for this would be that the systems that form long-term memories are simply immature and don't start working effectively until children hit the age of 4. But a recent animal experiment suggests that the situation in mice is more complex: the memories are there, they're just not normally accessible, although they can be re-activated. Now, a study that put human infants in an MRI tube suggests that memory activity starts by the age of 1, suggesting that the results in mice may apply to us.</p>\n<h2>Less than total recall</h2>\n<p>Mice are one of the species that we know experience infantile amnesia. And, thanks to over a century of research on mice, we have some sophisticated genetic tools that allow us to explore what's actually involved in the apparent absence of the animals' earliest memories.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/infants-can-form-memories-starting-at-1-but-they-dont-last-until-later/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/infants-can-form-memories-starting-at-1-but-they-dont-last-until-later/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"edae6d2a76cb09616a06287bf5d785f53a4dbfff62cfc53a789bbd3e2fe669d3","category":"Tech"}
