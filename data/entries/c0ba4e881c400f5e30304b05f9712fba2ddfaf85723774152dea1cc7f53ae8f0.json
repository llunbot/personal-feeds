Campagnolo considers the Shamal and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/campagnolo-levante-gravel-wheelset-review/\">Levante</a> gravel wheels to sit a tier below.</p>\n<p>The wheels will retail for £2,299.99 / $2,790 / €2,690. Australian pricing is to be confirmed.</p>\n<h2>Trickle-down technology</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Hyperon rim against a black background\" title=\"Campagnolo Hyperon rim against a black background\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The wheels are finished luxuriously.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Campagnolo </i></span></div>\n<p>Like its spendier sibling, the 37mm-deep Hyperon’s rims sport a 21mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rim-width-explained-for-road-bikes-mountain-bikes-and-gravel-bikes/\">internal width</a>.</p>\n<p>They’re moulded using Campagnolo’s HULC (Handmade Ultra-Light Carbon) technology. The brand says this process, which sees the carbon fibre oriented at a specific angle when it’s laid up in the mould, ensures optimal alignment and the ideal ratio of carbon fibre to resin.</p>\n<p>The Hyperons sport a single-joint construction over the industry standard of four, a technology Campagnolo first introduced on the Hyperon Ultra, which the brand says reduces any potential points of weakness.</p>\n<p>The wheels also feature Campagnolo’s C-Lux (short for Campagnolo Luxury) finish – the smooth, mirror-like appearance negating the need for lacquer and saving weight.</p>\n<h2>What do you miss out on?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Hyperon hub against a black background\" title=\"Campagnolo Hyperon hub against a black background\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Aluminium hubs are used instead of carbon.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Campagnolo</i></span></div>\n<p>There are some concessions to be made for the £850 saving.</p>\n<p>The Hyperons lack the Head-To-Bay system, which debuted on the Hyperon Ultra. This sees a rounded head fit over the spoke at the hub, which enables any forces to dissipate out of the spoke head, reducing the chance of deformation.</p>\n<p>The hubs are also aluminium rather than the svelte carbon found on the Hyperon Ultra and they forego the use of Campagnolo’s CULT (Ceramic Ultimate Level Technology) <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/ceramic-bearings/\">ceramic bearings</a>. We suspect they use Campagnolo’s USB (Ultra Smooth Bearings), but we’ve asked the brand for confirmation.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Hyperon hub against a black background\" title=\"Campagnolo Hyperon hub against a black background\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wheel truing should be less trouble-free.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Campagnolo</i></span></div>\n<p>You also get the regular N3W <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/freehubs/\">freehub</a> over the N3W Light option (where excess material has been removed) found on the Hyperon Ultra.</p>\n<p>Finally, in a move sure to please mechanics, the spoke nipples are located externally, which should make <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-true-a-wheel/\">wheel truing</a> easier. The Hyperon Ultras use Campagnolo’s Aero Mo-Mag technology, which sees the oversized aluminium spoke nipples hidden inside the rim.</p>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"c0ba4e881c400f5e30304b05f9712fba2ddfaf85723774152dea1cc7f53ae8f0","category":"Cycling"}
