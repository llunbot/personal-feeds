{"title":"AWS Weekly Roundup: S3 Conditional writes, AWS Lambda, JAWS Pankration, and more (August 26, 2024)","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-weekly-roundup-s3-conditional-writes-aws-lambda-jaws-pankration-and-more-august-26-2024/","date":1724696460000,"content":"<p>The AWS User Group Japan (JAWS-UG) hosted <a href=\"https://jawspankration2024.jaws-ug.jp/en/\">JAWS PANKRATION 2024 themed ‘No Border’</a>. This is a 24-hour online event where AWS Heroes, AWS Community Builders, AWS User Group leaders, and others from around the world discuss topics ranging from cultural discussions to technical talks. One of the speakers at this event, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevintuei/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BFmBY3%2B0AT%2Fys0kbVM382mw%3D%3D\">Kevin Tuei, an AWS Community Builder based in Kenya</a>, highlighted the importance of building in public and sharing your knowledge with others, a very fitting talk for this kind of event.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/26/pankration.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/26/pankration.png\" width=\"999\" height=\"477\" /></a></p> \n<p><span><strong>Last week’s launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some launches that got my attention during the previous week.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-s3-conditional-writes/\">Amazon S3 now supports conditional writes</a> – We’ve added support for conditional writes in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon S3</a> which check for existence of an object before creating it. With this feature, you can now simplify how distributed applications with multiple clients concurrently update data in parallel across shared datasets. Each client can conditionally write objects, making sure that it does not overwrite any objects already written by another client.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/aws-lambda-introduces-recursive-loop-detection-apis/\">AWS Lambda introduces recursive loop detection APIs</a> – With the recursive loop detection APIs you can now set recursive loop detection configuration on individual <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a> functions. This allows you to turn off recursive loop detection on functions that intentionally use recursive patterns, avoiding disruption of these workloads. Using these APIs, you can avoid disruption to any intentionally recursive workflows as Lambda expands support of recursive loop detection to other AWS services. Configure recursive loop detection for Lambda functions through the Lambda Console, the AWS command line interface (CLI), or Infrastructure as Code tools like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">AWS CloudFormation</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/\">AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)</a>, or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/\">AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)</a>. This new configuration option is supported in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/manage-sam-cli-versions.html#manage-sam-cli-versions-upgrade\">AWS SAM CLI</a> version 1.123.0 and CDK v2.153.0.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/enhance-call-center-efficiency-using-batch-inference-for-transcript-summarization-with-amazon-bedrock/\">General availability of Amazon Bedrock batch inference API</a> – You can now use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a> to process prompts in batch to get responses for model evaluation, experimentation, and offline processing. Using the batch API makes it more efficient to run inference with foundation models (FMs). It also allows you to aggregate responses and analyze them in batches. To get started, visit <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference.html\">Run batch inference</a>.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Other AWS news</strong></span><br /> Launched in July 2024, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/startups/lp/aws-gen-ai-lofts\">AWS GenAI Lofts is a global tour</a> designed to foster innovation and community in the evolving landscape of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
