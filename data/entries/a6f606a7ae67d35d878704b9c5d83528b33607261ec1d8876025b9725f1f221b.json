{"title":"Elon Musk: Apple's App Store Fees Are a 'De Facto Global Tax on the Internet'","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/30/elon-musk-on-apple-app-store-fees/","date":1627664660000,"content":"Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421152540394143746\">took to Twitter</a> today to criticize Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> fees in a tweet that sides with Epic in the ongoing Epic v. Apple dispute.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/app-store-blue-banner.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Epic is right,\" wrote Musk, before going on to call Apple's ‌App Store‌ fees a \"de facto global tax on the Internet.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMusk <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/26/elon-musk-apple-sniping-tesla-call/\">earlier this week</a> made veiled comments about ‌App Store‌ fees, but today's statement is a much more direct criticism.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDuring Tesla's earnings call, Musk said that Tesla was planning to let other companies use its charger network because Tesla does not want to \"create a walled garden\" and use that to \"bludgeon\" competitors. Musk said that this is a tactic used by \"some companies,\" and then he fake coughed and said \"Apple.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a> launched <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">a major dispute</a> with Apple in August 2020, defying the ‌App Store‌ rules and getting popular game Fortnite removed from the ‌App Store‌. After that, ‌Epic Games‌ launched a planned lawsuit to call out Apple's ‌App Store‌ fees and restrictions.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple and ‌Epic Games‌ went to trial earlier this year, and we're <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/24/epic-games-v-apple-trial-ends/\">waiting to hear the outcome</a>. ‌Epic Games‌ is aiming for alternate app store or app loading options, while Apple wants to maintain the status quo.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMusk has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/10/08/elon-musk-apple-hires-fired-tesla-workers/\">clashed with Apple</a> over the years due to employee poaching issues, but this is the first time he's directly spoken out about Apple's ‌App Store‌ policies. Tesla does not have a paid app in the ‌App Store‌ and is not impacted by fees.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMusk also took to Twitter today to deny claims that he'd once <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/30/elon-musk-wanting-to-become-apple-ceo/\">asked to be the CEO of Tesla</a>. A new book says that Musk once called Cook about a potential Apple acquisition of Tesla. The book claims that Musk asked to be CEO of Apple, at which point Cook said \"F-- you\" and hung up the phone. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Musk, he has never spoken or written to Cook, and while there was one point where he requested a meeting with Cook about a potential acquisition, Cook refused to meet. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html\">Cook has also said</a> that he has never spoken with Musk.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/\">Elon Musk</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/30/elon-musk-on-apple-app-store-fees/\">Elon Musk: Apple's App Store Fees Are a 'De Facto Global Tax on the Internet'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/elon-musk-apples-app-store-fees-are-a-de-facto-global-tax-on-the-internet.2306004/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0xy6rXxESzQ:uuNkOYHX-68:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0xy6rXxESzQ:uuNkOYHX-68:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/0xy6rXxESzQ\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a6f606a7ae67d35d878704b9c5d83528b33607261ec1d8876025b9725f1f221b","category":"Apple"}
