We went hands-on with the new app to give <em>MacRumors</em> readers a closer look.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nDesign wise, the app is similar to ‌Apple Music‌, but it is entirely dedicated to classical titles. The Browse section, for example, is broken down into Composers, Genres, Periods, Conductors, Orchestras, Soloists, Choirs, and Ensembles, making it easier to discover the specific classical content that you're looking for.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA Listen Now section offers up New Releases, Spatial Audio content, and other recommendations in various genres, plus there is a dedicated Library for aggregating saved content. A search function makes it simple to find something specific.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll in all, the app will be familiar to ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers, and it is in fact very simple. Unfortunately, it is limited to the ‌iPhone‌ at the current time, with no Mac or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> version available. It's also not available on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHave you tried ‌Apple Music‌ Classical?
