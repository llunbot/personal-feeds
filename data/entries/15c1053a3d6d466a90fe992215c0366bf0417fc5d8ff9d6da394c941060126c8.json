Given the larger screen, it's not fair to compare the two models. What is fair game, however, is to take a look at the new 16-inch MacBook Pro compared to the previous generation. We've put side by side the weight, height, and depth differences for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro compared to the previous generation.\r\n<br />\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>2021 16-inch MacBook Pro</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Weight: 4.7 pounds (2.1 kg)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Height: 0.66 inches (1.68 cm)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Depth: 9.77 inches (24.81 cm)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Width: 14.01 inches (35.37 cm)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>2019 16-inch MacBook Pro</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Weight: 4.3 pounds (2.0 kg)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Height: 0.64 inches (1.62 cm)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Depth: 9.68 inches (24.59 cm)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Width: 14.09 inches (35.79 cm)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n</div><div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nAs you can see from above, the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is nearly 9% heavier than the previous generation and is also slightly thicker. The new MacBook Pros feature a redesigned designed body, that is not also thicker and heavier, but also includes more I/O ports and new features.
