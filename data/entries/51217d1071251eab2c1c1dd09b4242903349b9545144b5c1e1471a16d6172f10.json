The unreleased build of Ventura appears to be build 22G80, whereas the officially released version from July 2023 is build 22G74. So far, the issue only seems to affect the basic M3 versions of the MacBook Pro and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Apple_Geek_Actu/status/1721898073549590690\">iMac</a> and not the M3 Pro or M3 Max versions, suggesting that the M3 Macs were ready to go a few months before the more powerful versions.</p>\n<p>So why did this happen, why can't these Macs update, and what can you do if you're affected?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981999#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981999&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"51217d1071251eab2c1c1dd09b4242903349b9545144b5c1e1471a16d6172f10","category":"Tech"}
