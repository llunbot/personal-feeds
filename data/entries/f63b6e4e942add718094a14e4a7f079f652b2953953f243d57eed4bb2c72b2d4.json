The most likely new arrival at the event is the M3 chip, which we expect to appear in a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484743/24-inch-imac-release-date-specs-m2-m3-processor-price.html\">new iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2111544/m3-macbook-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">new MacBook Pro</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">new Mac mini</a>. We may also see a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2000691/13-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-release-date-specs-rumors-html.html\">new MacBook Air</a> (although there are some doubts about that one because the 15-inch model only arrived in June). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may also see a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">new iPad mini</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/new-ipad-air-all-the-rumors-about-apples-6th-gen-ipad-air.html\">new iPad Air</a>. We may even see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">new AirPods</a>, with a cheaper model rumored.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow along with us as the news breaks in our Live Blog of the Apple Event. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we explain the different ways you can watch Apple’s Event live. We also offer important details about the event, such as when it starts, how long it’s likely to last, and what models of iPhones, iPads, Macs and PCs will be able to stream the live video.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What time does the Apple event start?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next Apple event is on Monday October 30, 2023. The start time is a lot later than usual. Instead of the normal start time of 10 a.m. Pacific time, it’s starting seven hours later at 5 p.m. PT. This means that in the U.K, the event starts at midnight! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what that translates to in the countries where most of our readers live:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>U.S.: 5 p.m. (PDT), 6 p.m. (MDT), 7 p.m. (CDT), 8 p.m. (EDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>U.K.: Next day at 12 a.m. (GMT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Europe: Next day at 1 a.m. (CET)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Canada: 5 p.m. (PDT), 6 p.m. (MDT), 7 p.m. (CDT), 8 p.m. (EDT), 9 p.m. (ADT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>India: The following day at 5.30 a.m. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Singapore and China: The following day at 8 a.m.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Australia: The following day at  8 a.m. (AWST), 10.30 a.m. (ACDT), 11 a.m. (AEDT), 10 a.m (AEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Zealand: The following day at 1 p.m. (NZDT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Since not all Apple events start this late and you may be landing on this page after the October event, we’ll include the normal event times here too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When events start at the usual time of 10 a.m. PT this is how that translates around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>U.S.: 10 a.m. (PDT), 11 a.m. (MDT), 12 p.m. (CDT), 1 p.m. (EDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>U.K.: 6 p.m. (BST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Europe: 7 p.m. (CEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Canada: 10 a.m. (PDT), 11 a.m. (MDT), 12 p.m. (CDT), 1 p.m. (EDT), 2 p.m. (ADT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>India: 10.30 p.m </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Singapore and China: The following day at 1 a.m.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Australia: The following day at 1 a.m. (AWST), 2.30 a.m. (ACST), 3 a.m. (AEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Zealand: The following day at 5 a.m. (NZST)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The event will probably last about two hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to watch the Apple event live</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve got a number of options.
