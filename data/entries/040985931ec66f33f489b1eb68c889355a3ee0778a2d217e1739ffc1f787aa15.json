And today’s sale is the lowest we’ve seen in more than a decade: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core-Ethernet/dp/B0BSHGHGXR/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the M2 Mac mini with 256GB of storage for $500</a>, a savings of $99 and the best price we’ve ever seen. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core-Ethernet/dp/B0BSHGTPMV/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">512GB model is also on sale for $690</a>, a savings of $190, and also an all-time low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M2 Mac mini looks the same as its M1 predecessor but has a faster chip, HDMI 2 for powering an 8K display, Wi-Fi 6E for faster Internet speeds, and Bluetooth 5.3. Like before, you also get a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports and USB-A ports, all wrapped in a stunningly silent design that will look great on your desk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of your desk, if you need a monitor to go with your new Mac, the 27-inch Studio Display is also on sale. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09V3GZD32/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the Studio Display for $1,350</a>, a savings of $249 and the best price we’ve seen. Along with a gorgeous design and stunning 5K monitor, the Studio Display has built-in speakers that support spatial audio and a 1080p webcam on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1475814/m2-mac-mini-budget-specs-byodkm.html\">Mac mini launched in 2005</a>, it was a tremendous value at $499, but the latest model hasn’t been that cheap since then. That makes Amazon’s sale a true throwback and the best Mac value you’re likely to find all year.</p>\n\nMac Mini</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"040985931ec66f33f489b1eb68c889355a3ee0778a2d217e1739ffc1f787aa15","category":"Apple"}
