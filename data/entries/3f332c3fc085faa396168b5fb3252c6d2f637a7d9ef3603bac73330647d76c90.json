{"title":"Tip of the Day: You Can Select Multiple Tabs, Then Drag Them, in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox","link":"https://mastodon.social/@jackwellborn/111539651190313429","date":1702003440000,"content":"\n<p>Jack Wellborn:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I just recently discovered that you can select and drag multiple \nSafari tabs by holding Shift or Command, just as you would to \nselect and drag multiple items in Finder. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had no idea you could do this with tabs. Just like making multiple selections in a list view, Shift-click will select an entire range at once, and Command-clicking lets you select (and deselect) noncontiguous tabs. If I’d known you could do this, I probably never would have written <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/05/an-applescript-for-safari-split-tabs-to-new-window\">the AppleScript I posted the other day</a> — but if I hadn’t written and posted that script, I don’t think I would learned this trick. Once you have multiple tabs selected, you can drag them together to create a new window, or do things like close them all at once.</p>\n\n<p>This same trick works in Firefox and Chrome (and Chrome-derived browsers like Brave), too. This trick does <em>not</em> work in Safari on iPadOS, because iPads are baby computers where you can’t select more than one thing at a time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> In a reply on Threads, <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@jayrobinson/post/C0kzEPbudRQ/\">Jay Robinson points out</a> (and includes a nice screencast) that you can select multiple Safari tabs on iPad with multitouch. Drag one tab out of the tab bar, then, while keeping the drag active with one finger, use another finger to tap additional tabs to add them to the collection of tabs being dragged. But: all you can seemingly do with such a collection of dragged tabs is move them to another area in the current Safari window, or drop them as URLs into another app, like a message in Mail or Apple Notes. You can drag a single tab in iPad Safari to the edge of the screen to move it to a new split screen window, but if you have more than one tab in the drag collection, you can’t do that. Nor can you take group actions on the collection of tabs, like closing them all at once, or closing all tabs in the window <em>other</em> than the selected ones, like you can with the multiple-tab-selection feature in the big-boy Safari on MacOS. You <em>can</em> drag a collection of tabs on iPadOS into a tab group, if you have the sidebar open. That’s useful in combination with tab search, to filter the list of visible tabs — search, select the tabs that match the search term, and drag them together to a new or existing tab group. (You can create a drag collection of multiple tabs in iPhone Safari the same way.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/07/safari-chrome-firebox-multiple-tab-selection\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3f332c3fc085faa396168b5fb3252c6d2f637a7d9ef3603bac73330647d76c90","category":"Tech"}
