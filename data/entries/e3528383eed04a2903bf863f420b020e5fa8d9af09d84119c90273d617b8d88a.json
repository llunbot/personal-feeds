The result is the all-new Fox 34 SL–XC bred, Downcountry ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 34 SL is truly an entirely new fork, from the ground up. Nothing about it carries over from the 34 SC. Here are the key features, all explained below:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Generative arch &amp; crown</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Full-size chassis (no Step Cast)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increased bushing overlap</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Inboard bypass channels</li>\n\n\n\n<li>More travel</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The really impressive thing is they didn’t stop with strength and stiffness. It’s also markedly smoother, thanks to small but important design changes. Combined with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2025-fox-grip-dampers-deliver-better-faster-control/\">the new dampers introduced in 2024</a>, this truly is the best 34 fork ever. I’ll have a separate review, but first, here’s the tech:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Generative Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-1.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1650\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-1.webp\" alt=\"closeup of arch showing tire clearance on new 2026 fox 34 sl fork.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-1.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-1-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-1-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-1-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-1-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-1-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Tyler Benedict)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 34 SL borrows the same generative design philosophy from the new 32 SC, with a punctured arch to save weight, and dramatic sculpting and machining of both the arch and crown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why no reverse arch? Because over 100mm travel, it becomes less practical for frame clearance reasons because of how the fork rake is achieved … the 32 SC does this by angling the <em>crown</em> more than the <em>axle offset</em>, but the others use more traditional angles and axle dropout positioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s 29er only, and is only available with a 44mm offset.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Full Size Chassis, Basically the Same Weight</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-fork-details.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-fork-details.webp\" alt=\"closeup details on new 2026 fox 34 sl mountain bike fork.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-fork-details.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-fork-details-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-fork-details-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-fork-details-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-fork-details-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-fork-details-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-fork-details-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>All photos courtesy of Fox unless otherwise noted.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 34 SL replaces the 34 SC, using a standard-width chassis rather than the narrower SC design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This opens up tire clearance and improves torsional stiffness. Overall stiffness is 17% better, travel goes up to 130mm now, and it fits 2.5″ tires:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1650\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-2.webp\" alt=\"closeup of arch showing tire clearance on new 2026 fox 34 sl fork.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-2.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-2-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-2-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-2-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Plenty of clearance with these Schwalbe 29×2.4″ tires. (Photo/Tyler Benedict)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Best of all, all of these improvements come with just a 3.5% weight increase over the 34 Step Cast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do that, Fox applied all the tricks, like black anodizing the crown rather than powder coating, saving 7-8 grams. And internally butting the damper-side stanchion, because it doesn’t need straight internal walls like the air spring side. And they skipped the pressure bleeders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result? A claimed weight of 1,475g. That’s only 33g heavier than the outgoing 34 SC’s weight of 1,442g. Oh, and that’s for a 130mm travel 34 SL versus a 120mm 34 SC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bigger Brakes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-riding-action-Peter-Disera-25.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1467\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-riding-action-Peter-Disera-25.webp\" alt=\"fox 34 sl fork being ridden on trails\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-riding-action-Peter-Disera-25.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-riding-action-Peter-Disera-25-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-riding-action-Peter-Disera-25-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-riding-action-Peter-Disera-25-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-riding-action-Peter-Disera-25-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-riding-action-Peter-Disera-25-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-riding-action-Peter-Disera-25-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Fox-34SL-riding-action-Peter-Disera-25-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another change is it now fits a minimum 180mm rotor. OK, but if this is their new XCO race fork, why 180mm rotors? Because it’s also their <em>downcountry</em> race fork, and some of those folks want 200mm rotors. They say many of their XCO pros were running 180mm rotors anyway, so why not reduce the number of adapters?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smoother Than Ever</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34SL-wider-bushing-spacing-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1811\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34SL-wider-bushing-spacing-scaled.webp\" alt=\"internal see-thru diagram showing wider bushing spacing on new 2026 fox forks.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34SL-wider-bushing-spacing-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34SL-wider-bushing-spacing-297x210.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34SL-wider-bushing-spacing-1536x1087.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34SL-wider-bushing-spacing-120x85.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34SL-wider-bushing-spacing-768x543.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34SL-wider-bushing-spacing-2048x1449.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s where it gets really interesting. To make the fork smoother, Fox made three major redesigns:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Longer Stanchions = More Bushing Overlap</strong><br />First, they gave the fork longer upper tubes (stanchions). This allowed for more bushing overlap (20mm more!), which means lower binding forces (friction) under fore-aft loading.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-4.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1547\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-4.webp\" alt=\"side bypass channels inside fox 34 sl forks.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-4.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-4-297x209.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-4-1536x1080.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-4-120x84.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-4-768x540.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fox-34-sl-xc-trail-suspension-fork-4-2048x1440.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Tyler Benedict)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Internal Bypass Channels</strong><br />Ever noticed those graduated ridges on the backs of Fox’s fork legs? Those are bypass channels, allowing the air from under the damper or air spring to access the space between the bushings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re important because that air is trapped inside the fork, and it’s not a tunable element like your normal air spring. Yet it is basically a second air spring, because it gets compressed every time your fork compresses. So it, too, ramps up and affects suspension performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, Fox (and likely every other brand) tunes the fork based on this, because it’s a known quantity. But anytime they can make that air volume bigger, they can lessen its effect on performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in a Fox 36, without those bypass channels, at bottom out, there would be about 45psi in the lower legs, on each side. But with the bypass channels, that drops to about 15psi, which has much less impact on your fork’s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is great, <em>buuuuuuut……</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fox upgraded their FEA software and found new hotspots on the bushings around those channels. Forks see much higher fore-aft loads than lateral loads, and so the bushings could deform ever so slightly over that channel, which created pressure points and thus friction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So moving the bypass channels to the sides provided more support for the lower bushing where it needed it, yielding more even contact pressure with the stanchions. Boom, less friction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Longer Air Springs</strong><br />Lastly, the air springs are now longer, so there’s more negative volume, which makes for a plusher fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But wait, there’s more… or, not</strong><br />There are actually other technologies they developed to further improve smoothness, but found that for this fork and its shorter travel application, those ideas didn’t move the needle enough to offset the small weight gain. But, you might see those later… I just can’t tell you about them yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dampers &amp; Other Upgrades</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-34SL-air-cap-closeup.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1509\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-34SL-air-cap-closeup.webp\" alt=\"new cassette tool air spring top cap on fox 34 sl fork.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-34SL-air-cap-closeup.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-34SL-air-cap-closeup-297x224.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-34SL-air-cap-closeup-1536x1159.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-34SL-air-cap-closeup-120x91.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-34SL-air-cap-closeup-768x579.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ve switched the air spring cap to a Shimano Cassette Lock Ring interface. Until now their forks used an extremely low profile socket, requiring special flat-faced sockets to avoid rounding it off.
