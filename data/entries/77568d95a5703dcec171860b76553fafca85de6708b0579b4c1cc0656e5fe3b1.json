Every now and then we hear a bell so we watch the race ending. Then we just get back to drinking.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might sound like something you’d overhear from a spectator witnessing their first track race, and indeed it is: overheard by Tony Gibb, joint founder and director of the London 3 Day, which held its inaugural event at the Lee Valley Velodrome in October. Gibb is a former racer himself and no stranger to the chaotic environment of the velodrome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I rode for Great Britain for six years from 2000. I got a silver medal at the Worlds, a bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games and I actually won a small six day in 2005,’ Gibb tells <em>Cyclist</em>. ‘So, yeah, I’ve mixed it with them out there.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"London 3 Day\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-02-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-02-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-02-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-02-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Riders came from all over the world to compete in London, including Canada, Poland, Czechia, Denmark, Switzerland, New Zealand, Spain, Norway and the USA.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Multi-day track racing combines numerous events – madison, points race, elimination, derny racing, and so on – with a party atmosphere fuelled by loud music and copious amounts of beer. As a spectacle it may be past its heyday, but across Europe there are still annual multi-day events in Berlin, Rotterdam, Bremen and the mother of them all, Ghent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a few years London had a six-day event that featured British luminaries such as Mark Cavendish, Bradley Wiggins and Peter Kennaugh, but it wound up in 2019 and since then track cycling events have been on something of a hiatus in the UK. Which is where Gibb and his Full Gas Cycling organisation comes in.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"London 3 Day\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘We organise everything from grass roots racing and Tuesday night track league through to the Good Friday UCI event and the World Masters Track Championships,’ says Gibb. ‘Even with the contacts we have access to, we knew six days was a bit too much. It was year one so we didn’t have a massive budget. Thankfully the UCI were fantastic, as were the many volunteers that don’t want the six-day scene to die.’</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Tracked changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For Gibb, the track, and specifically this scene, offers a totally different environment for the riders, especially compared to the game-faced sterility we see on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘They’re dead serious, they’re focussed, I get that they are there to win but it’s really nice to see these riders understand that there’s also a crowd to entertain. It’s a party atmosphere.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"London 3 Day\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-04-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>But getting the riders on board – stony faced or otherwise – is as much about your Rolodex as it is your organisational skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I raced alongside guys like Roger Kluge, Elia Viviani, Yoeri Havik and Bradley Wiggins, and I’m fortunate enough to have their phone numbers. Of course, you’ve got to pay people because you’re selling tickets off their names. Viviani sorted out the rest of the Italians and it really fell into place when the Italian women’s team won at the Olympics.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the timing of the event (just after the World Championships) and the nature of the sport, it’s also teed up for things to go wrong. And at very late notice.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"London 3 Day\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The action on the track is frenetic.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘There’s every chance someone’s going to break a collarbone or get Covid on the plane,’ says Gibb. ‘You’ve already got graphics made for the big screen and programmes printed. You can’t even really have standbys just sitting at home waiting by the phone.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that any of that will stop the party, although Gibb admits it’s hard to recreate the booze-fuelled atmosphere of the legendary Ghent Six.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You’re never going to replicate Ghent – it’s the Monaco of cycling. Lee Valley is in a residential area and we’ve got to be out by 10.30pm, so there’s no rolling on to 2am like in Bremen or Berlin.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"London 3 Day\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/london-3-day-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There’s also the shape of the track. Ghent’s track is a lot smaller than Lee Valley, its banking is steeper, so the fans are closer and louder, the racing is faster and the crashes can be more spectacular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The alternative is hiring a great big hall and building the track in it,’ says Gibb, ‘which is going to cost you £1 million. We’ve got our own little bit of history at Lee Valley and I wouldn’t dream of changing that.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+7\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-7-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Going global</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>October’s event attracted riders from all over the world.
