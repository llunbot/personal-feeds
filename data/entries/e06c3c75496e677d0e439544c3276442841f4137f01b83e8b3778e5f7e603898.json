Apple designed the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release 130 includes bug fixes and performance improvements for Web Inspector, CSS, JavaScript, Media, Web API, and IndexedDB.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple warns that Tab Groups do not sync in this release, and on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a>, users need to enable GPU Process: Media from Experimental Features under the Develop menu to address issues with streaming services. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe current ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release is built on the new Safari 15 update included in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a>, and as such, it includes several Safari 15 features. There's a new streamlined tab bar with support for Tab Groups to organize tabs, along with improved support for Safari Web Extensions.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLive Text allows users to select and interact with text in images on the web, but the ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Mac is required. There's also Quick Notes support for adding links and Safari highlights to remember important information and ideas.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther updates <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Safari-Release-Notes/safari-15-beta-release-notes\">include</a> WebGL 2 and new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ update is available for both ‌macOS Big Sur‌ and ‌macOS Monterey‌, the newest version of the Mac operating system that's set to release this fall.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences to anyone who has <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/\">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/\">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's aim with ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/\">Safari Technology Preview</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/18/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-130/\">Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 130 With Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-130-with-bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements.2307952/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9bbFp69kHZI:8JuEpEncO1A:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9bbFp69kHZI:8JuEpEncO1A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/9bbFp69kHZI\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e06c3c75496e677d0e439544c3276442841f4137f01b83e8b3778e5f7e603898","category":"Apple"}
