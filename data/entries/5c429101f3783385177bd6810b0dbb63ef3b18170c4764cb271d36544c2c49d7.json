Primephonic offered an \"outstanding listening experience\" with search and browse functionality that is specifically optimized for classical music, as well as handpicked recommendations and \"contextual details on repertoire and recordings.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple said that with the acquisition of Primephonic, ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers would be provided with an improved classical music experience. This was said to start with Primephonic playlists and audio content, followed by a dedicated Primephonic experience with improved browsing and search capabilities by composer and repertoire, better classical music metadata, and more, at a later date.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMost strikingly, Apple said that it would launch a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/new-apple-music-app-coming-next-year/\">new Apple Music app</a> dedicated to classical music in 2022. The app will combine Primephonic's user interface and specializations for classical music with ‌Apple Music‌ and features such as Lossless and Spatial Audio.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is now looking to hire a UX Designer to work on the new app in the classical music team, according to a <a href=\"https://jobs.apple.com/en-ca/details/200320494/ux-designer-classical-music\">listing on Apple's jobs site</a>. The role, located in London or Amsterdam, will be expected to \"provide UX expertise and new perspectives specifically for Primephonic.\" The job listing goes on to explain that Apple is exploring and creating a distinct experience for classical music, including \"visual, audial, and haptic\" aspects.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the job listing suggests that the Primephonic brand will persist for the new app, Primephonic was taken offline on September 7, 2021 and is no longer available for new subscribers. Current Primephonic subscribers received six months of ‌Apple Music‌ access for free with access to thousands of classical albums that support Lossless and Spatial Audio.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.primephonic.com\">Primephonic's website</a> now tells visitors: \"We are working on an amazing new classical music experience from Apple for early next year.\" It is not clear to what extent the Primephonic brand will persist in the new app, if at all, and how heavily it will amalgamate with ‌Apple Music‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Thanks, Chris!)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/09/apple-continuing-work-on-new-classical-music-app/\">Apple Continuing Work on New Apple Music App for Classical Music</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-continuing-work-on-new-apple-music-app-for-classical-music.2326807/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=O6pCmL6MLkQ:m7HDRdgRSKc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=O6pCmL6MLkQ:m7HDRdgRSKc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5c429101f3783385177bd6810b0dbb63ef3b18170c4764cb271d36544c2c49d7","category":"Apple"}
