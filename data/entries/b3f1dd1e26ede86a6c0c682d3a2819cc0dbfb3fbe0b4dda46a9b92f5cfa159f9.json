{"title":"MacRumors Giveaway: Win an iPhone 16 Pro From GRID Studio","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/macrumors-giveaway-iphone-16-pro-february/","date":1740771104000,"content":"For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with GRID Studio to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a 128GB <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> from Apple. For those unfamiliar with GRID Studio, it is a company that recycles discarded Apple products into art that celebrates Apple's history.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/grid-iphone-2g.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nGRID Studio is having a special spring sale on some of its most popular products this week, plus there is a 15 percent off site wide discount available with the promo code SS15. As part of the sale, the <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation\">GRID iPhone 2G</a>, which features Apple's most iconic <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, is available for $299.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone‌ 2G is also known as the original ‌iPhone‌, and it was the first ‌iPhone‌ that Apple made back in 2007. GRID's ‌iPhone‌ 2G piece features all of the device's internal components, labeled and artfully arrayed. The iconic original ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌ casing is positioned next to the power button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, ear piece, and other components, and this is before the days where Apple started making its own chips so there are some unique components to see.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-3gs\">GRID iPhone 3GS</a> is half off and just $99. The ‌‌iPhone‌‌ 3GS followed the ‌‌iPhone‌‌ 3G, and that \"S\" was meant to represent speed. It had a processor that was twice as fast as the prior model, and it was Apple's first foray into really focusing on blazing fast performance. The GRID 3GS features the classic pre-iPhone 4 design, and it looks great framed and on the wall.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-3gs-white.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nYou can also <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s\">get the GRID 4S</a> for $99, and it features approximately 40 internal components from the ‌iPhone‌ 4S. The ‌iPhone‌ 4S was actually the last ‌iPhone‌ that was introduced in Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' lifetime, and it was the first Apple ‌iPhone‌ that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> introduced on stage without Jobs. The \"S\" stood for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, and it was the first ‌iPhone‌ with Apple's personal assistant.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/grid-iphone-4s.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nGRID Studio offers plenty of other iPhones, too, plus iPads. If you have a favorite ‌‌iPhone‌‌ generation, it's likely that GRID has taken it apart. With each art piece, GRID separates out each of the components and provides labels for the parts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo celebrate the spring sale, GRID Studio is giving away an ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ to one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
