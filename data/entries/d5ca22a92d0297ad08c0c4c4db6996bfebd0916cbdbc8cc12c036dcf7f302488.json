In turn, those drives would infect any new machine they connected to, a capability that allowed the malware to spread without requiring any end-user interaction. Researchers who have tracked PlugX since at least 2008 have said that the malware has origins in China and has been used by various groups tied to the country’s Ministry of State Security.</p>\n<h2>Still active after all these years</h2>\n<p>For reasons that aren’t clear, the worm creator abandoned the one and only IP address that was designated as its command-and-control channel. With no one controlling the infected machines anymore, the PlugX worm was effectively dead, or at least one might have presumed so. The worm, it turns out, has continued to live on in an undetermined number of machines that possibly reaches into the millions, researchers from security firm Sekoia <a href=\"https://blog.sekoia.io/unplugging-plugx-sinkholing-the-plugx-usb-worm-botnet/\">reported</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020055#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020055&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d5ca22a92d0297ad08c0c4c4db6996bfebd0916cbdbc8cc12c036dcf7f302488","category":"Tech"}
