SRM USA suggests it’s their latest PM9 direct mount spider power meter paired with a titanium Cane Creek eeWings MTB crankset. Light, stiff, and benchmark accuracy. What more could you want? Hopefully, your budget is pretty big, though…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Add a SRM powermeter to Cane Creek eeWings MTB cranks </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_complete.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"820\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_complete.jpg\" alt=\"Cane Creek eeWings X SRM PM9 titanium mountain bike crankset with powermeter, complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_complete.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_complete-297x122.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_complete-800x328.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_complete-120x49.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_complete-768x315.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_complete-1536x630.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.

Sure, you could mount a Power2Max spider to your eeWings, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But is anyone buying a titanium crankset and a power meter spider really looking to save just a few bucks? You might as well splurge and get the 9th-generation SRAM PM9 powermeter, which is pretty much considered the industry benchmark, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How much will it cost you?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_power-meter-spider.jpg\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"2400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_power-meter-spider.jpg\" alt=\"Cane Creek eeWings X SRM PM9 titanium mountain bike crankset with powermeter, PM9 power meter spider\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_power-meter-spider.jpg 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_power-meter-spider-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_power-meter-spider-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_power-meter-spider-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_power-meter-spider-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_power-meter-spider-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_power-meter-spider-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_ti-crank-arms.jpg\"><img width=\"1350\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_ti-crank-arms.jpg\" alt=\"Cane Creek eeWings X SRM PM9 titanium mountain bike crankset with powermeter, ti cranks arms\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_ti-crank-arms.jpg 1350w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_ti-crank-arms-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_ti-crank-arms-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_ti-crank-arms-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_ti-crank-arms-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cane-Creek-eeWings-X-SRM-PM9-titanium-mountain-bike-crankset-with-powermeter_ti-crank-arms-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Buyers in the US can pick up a complete setup from SRM for just $2100, or $2175 with a chainring included, and a delivery lead-time of 4-5 weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow, only twenty-one hundred dollars you say? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you had to buy them separately, that would be $1100 direct from Cane Creek for just the 400g eeWings ti MTB crankarms &amp; axle, plus another $1300 for the compatible SRAM 3-bolt direct mount PM9 spider on its own.

But Cane Creek says you may still be able to find a set if your local bike shop snapped them up. Cane Creek standard mount road eeBrakes are always sought after for classic rim brake builds. And the limited editions are always a rare treat. These patriotic beauties would have set you back $780 for the pair. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe, you’ll still find a pair if you dig deep enough? But maybe it’ll cost you even more. Still cheaper than an SRM powermeter, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://canecreek.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CaneCreek.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cane-creek-srm-an-ultralight-stiff-titanium-crankset-with-a-powermeter/\">Cane Creek + SRM, an Ultralight &amp; Stiff Titanium Crankset with a PowerMeter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b495e7d0ba5092652961bf297cbd4f8868f2d6d377b76d26de8b9ad4503ecf30","category":"Cycling"}
