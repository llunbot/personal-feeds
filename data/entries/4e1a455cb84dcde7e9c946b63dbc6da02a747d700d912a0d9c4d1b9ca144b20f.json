{"title":"‘Making “Social” Social Again’ — Ev Williams Explains Mozi","link":"https://ev.medium.com/making-social-social-again-0126fa5c6ce8","date":1734061946000,"content":"\n<p>Ev Williams, writing the backstory of, and <em>raison d’être</em> for <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/12/mozi\">Mozi</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And here we are, 20+ years later, with address books full of\npartial, duplicate, and outdated information. Perhaps the reason\nfor this is that social networks (or <em>the</em> social network) solved\nthis problem — for a while. When Facebook was ubiquitous it was\nprobably a pretty good reflection of many people’s real-life\nrelationships. It told you where they lived, who you knew in\ncommon, and all kinds of other details.</p>\n\n<p>Another idea that seemed obvious was that, given how deeply social\nhumans are, social products would dominate the internet. Ten to\nfifteen years ago, this seemed inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>But something else happened instead.</p>\n\n<p>Social networks became “social media,” which, at first, meant\nreceiving content from people you chose to hear from. But in the\nquest to maximize engagement, the timeline of friends and people\nyou picked to follow turned into a free-for-all battle for\nattention. And it turns out, for most people, your friends aren’t\nas entertaining as (god forbid) <em>influencers</em> who spend their\nwaking hours making “content.”</p>\n\n<p>In other words, social media became … <em>media</em>.</p>\n\n<p>To tell you the truth, I think there are positive aspects of this\nevolution (perhaps I’ll get into that in another post). But we\nclearly lost something.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This whole piece is so good, so clear. This distinction between social <em>networking</em> and social <em>media</em> is obvious in hindsight, but only in hindsight. Williams posted it on Medium (<a href=\"https://ev.medium.com/new-decade-new-ideas-faee8e712589\">natch</a>), but <a href=\"https://www.mozi.app/\">Mozi’s website</a> links directly to it for their “About” page. I’m excited about this. I think they’re on to something here. It’s even a great name.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/12/mozi-making-social-social-again\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4e1a455cb84dcde7e9c946b63dbc6da02a747d700d912a0d9c4d1b9ca144b20f","category":"Tech"}
