We should also see updates for tvOS and the HomePod operating system on the same date.</p>\n<p>The new releases bring a number of new features and refinements to Appleâ€™s platforms: better texting with Android devices thanks to support for the RCS standard, iPhone Mirroring that allows you to interact with your iPhone via your Mac, more UI customization options for iPhones and iPads, and other improvements besides.</p>\n<p>What won't be included in these initial releases is any hint of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/for-apple-ai-now-stands-for-apple-intelligence-launched-at-wwdc-2024/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, the batch of generative AI and machine learning features that Apple announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Apple is testing some of the Apple Intelligence features in betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS 15.1, updates that will be released later this fall. When Apple Intelligence does arrive, compatibility will be limited: it will require an iPhone 15 Pro or one of the just-announced iPhone 16 or 16 Pro models; an iPad Air or Pro with an M1, M2, or M4 chip; or an Apple Silicon Mac. Apple will also be withholding Apple Intelligence from devices in the EU, at least for now.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048328#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048328&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d266106ae37c5c3777a3b2feb91339da5146eabeddc20e54bb9554903a5dedfb","category":"Tech"}
