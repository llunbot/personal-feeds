They are super important and high up the list but not at the very top. To answer this question, we need to look at the total bike and rider system and which parts of this system contribute the most drag. In road cycling, the rider is around 75% of the total aero drag, so this is our first point of call.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112753/swiss-side-wind-tunnel-testing-bike-rider-position-aerodynamic-gains.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112753/swiss-side-wind-tunnel-testing-bike-rider-position-aerodynamic-gains.jpg\" alt=\"swiss side aerodynamic testing wind tunnel\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1094\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112753/swiss-side-wind-tunnel-testing-bike-rider-position-aerodynamic-gains.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112753/swiss-side-wind-tunnel-testing-bike-rider-position-aerodynamic-gains-297x203.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112753/swiss-side-wind-tunnel-testing-bike-rider-position-aerodynamic-gains-800x547.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112753/swiss-side-wind-tunnel-testing-bike-rider-position-aerodynamic-gains-120x82.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112753/swiss-side-wind-tunnel-testing-bike-rider-position-aerodynamic-gains-768x525.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112753/swiss-side-wind-tunnel-testing-bike-rider-position-aerodynamic-gains-1536x1050.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The rider position makes the biggest difference and costs nothing. The difference between the ‘cafe position’ (top bars, hands in the middle, straight arms) and an aero position with arms bent with hands flat on the hoods, is around 40W at 35km/h (85W at 45km/h). So, the biggest bang for buck is your yoga class to build core strength to ride lower positions for longer.</p><p>The next biggest influencer is rider apparel. A snug fitting one-piece aero suit can bring 14W at 35km/h (30W at 45km/h). Add winter gear and these numbers double again. So, being conscious of what apparel you choose is very important.</p><div id=\"attachment_276716\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112844/swiss-side-aero-wheel-testing-wind-tunnel.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-276716\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112844/swiss-side-aero-wheel-testing-wind-tunnel.jpg\" alt=\"swiss side aero road wheel testing wind tunnel\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112844/swiss-side-aero-wheel-testing-wind-tunnel.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112844/swiss-side-aero-wheel-testing-wind-tunnel-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112844/swiss-side-aero-wheel-testing-wind-tunnel-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112844/swiss-side-aero-wheel-testing-wind-tunnel-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112844/swiss-side-aero-wheel-testing-wind-tunnel-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112844/swiss-side-aero-wheel-testing-wind-tunnel-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-276716\">In addition to their own wheelsets, like the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/08/25/swiss-side-hadron%C2%B2-ultimate-aero-road-wheels-reshaped-for-faster-more-stable-aerodynamic-gains/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hadron2 Ultimate</a> shown here, Swiss Side also lend their expertise toward development of DT SWISS wheels such as the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2017/05/17/dt-swiss-pushes-deeper-redefinin-aero-three-arc-1100-carbon-wheelsets-swissside/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ARC 1100</a></p></div><p>Next up are indeed the wheels. A good set of aero wheels deliver in the order of 7W at 35km/h (15W at 45km/h) over a normal set of stock low profile aluminum wheels. And, this benefit increases significantly when there is wind about due to the “sailing effect”. A good front wheel can actually generate thrust (negative) drag if the wind is right.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112746/swiss-side-helmet-testing-wind-tunnel-aerodynamics.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112746/swiss-side-helmet-testing-wind-tunnel-aerodynamics.jpg\" alt=\"swiss side aerodynamic helmet testing wind tunnel\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112746/swiss-side-helmet-testing-wind-tunnel-aerodynamics.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112746/swiss-side-helmet-testing-wind-tunnel-aerodynamics-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112746/swiss-side-helmet-testing-wind-tunnel-aerodynamics-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112746/swiss-side-helmet-testing-wind-tunnel-aerodynamics-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112746/swiss-side-helmet-testing-wind-tunnel-aerodynamics-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/29112746/swiss-side-helmet-testing-wind-tunnel-aerodynamics-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>Helmets also provide plenty of potential in road cycling (and time trial).

Not only will this ensure you’re physically in the best position for your body shape, but also that you’re able to comfortably hold that position, which is arguably more important.</p><p>Another low hanging fruit is clothing; you don’t need to go out and find the most expensive skin suit available, just ensure that everything is tight fitting once you’re in the correct position. If it’s a flat course and you’re comfortable with your power output, remove the front derailleur and run the bike 1x.</p><p>If it’s a longer course and you need hydration, look at bottles and cages that fit between the arms (clip on aero bar bottle cage) or behind the seat. And finally, tyres and wheels. This will take some serious investment but it’s a fundamentally important next step.</p><p>Wheel aerodynamics can easily take up its own article but, in short, look for the right balance between stability, weight and aero performance; narrow and deep for the rear wheel, wide and shallower for the front (if your frame can accommodate it). Ensure that the tyre you choose (brand and width) matches the wheel profile.</p><p><strong>Roval:</strong> Within Roval’s arsenal of equipment, the rider looking for the best bang for his/her buck when it comes to aero gains on a road bike should think about their leading edge. Obviously, it’s no secret that wheels are a huge aero upgrade.</p><p>Common knowledge has been deeper is faster for a TT, but with our Rapide wheel we focused not only on a super aero 51mm deep front wheel, but ensuring that speed came with the stability necessary to use it – 25% more stable in a crosswind than our CLX50.</p><p>We also recommend our Roval Rapide bar, offering a 20 second saving over a round bar, with aero details like a recessed step to ensure your bar wrap is flush with the tops and internal cable routing. Another key bar stat to keep in mind when looking for aero gains is width. I’m sure you’ve seen how many pros are going narrower and narrower. It is to reduce the frontal area of your body, and really improve aero.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AU8I0839.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AU8I0839.jpg\" alt=\"specialized s-works road bike roval wheels aero riding position\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AU8I0839.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AU8I0839-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AU8I0839-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AU8I0839-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AU8I0839-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>This obviously leads to the overall importance of fit. We asked our Retül fit Guru, Scott Stroot, his thoughts and he said, <em>“Aero bikes and aero components are most helpful if you are positioned in the most aero position your body can hold at the highest amount of power for an extended period of time. If you are not positioned well you can be losing power, aerodynamics or both. This is why a Retül fit is so essential to riders maximizing aerodynamics and power.”</em></p><p>If you’re riding your standard road bike in a TT or off the front w/o aero bars our WinTunnel engineer and Body Geometry Research manager said, <em>“Simply adjusting your body position into a crouched position on the hoods or drops will improve aerodynamics. Crouching so that a rider’s forearms are flat/parallel to the ground can improve aerodynamics in the range of 6-12 W at 40 kph depending on the initial, non-crouched position.”</em></p><p>When it comes to aero gains with equipment across the spectrum wheels, clothing and helmet are the top 3 bang for your buck purchases.</p><p><strong>Sam Pendred, designer of the Hope HB.TT:</strong></p><ul><li>Working on developing the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hb.tt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://HB.TT&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635581966593000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFhZeuWCyUrDf3BBI3KVjv9cPwZjg\">HB.TT</a> further and because of the radical design, we are trying things in the wind tunnel that “usually” give riders a big gain – but the design of this bike can be counter intuitive.
