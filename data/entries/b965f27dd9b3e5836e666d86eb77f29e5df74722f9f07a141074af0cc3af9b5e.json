{"title":"After a huge June, here’s everything coming from Apple in July","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/1970098/july-2023-apple-releases-ios-17-macos-sonoma-beta-beats-studio-pro.html","date":1688121000000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>June was one of the biggest months of the year for Apple. WWDC brought us the M2 Ultra chip, Mac Studio updates, the Mac Pro, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1948603/15-inch-macbook-air-m2-review.html\">15-inch MacBook Air</a>, and of course details and first developer betas on all the fall operating system updates. Oh, and Apple unveiled this little side project called the Vision Pro, which isn’t shipping until early 2024. You can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1942679/wwdc-2023-keynote-macbook-air-m2-ultra-ios-17-macos-14-vision-pro.html\">catch up on all the WWDC stuff here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what does that leave for July? Well, with all the new Macs already shipping and no new hardware expected until September, July, and August are all about software and services. We expect iOS 16.6 to release in July, but more importantly, the public betas of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, watchOS 9, tvOS 17, and macOS Sonoma should be released in July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of great Apple TV+ shows and Apple Arcade games to look forward to this summer, too. Let’s break it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Look, I could write a few paragraphs about how it’s <em>possible</em> to see some new Apple product in July, like second-gen AirPods Max, but that’s a big stretch. All the new Macs are out and there’s nothing even rumored to land until the September release of iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Series 9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one “sort-of” Apple product potentially coming this month: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1814975/new-beats-studio-pro-headphones-found-in-latest-ios-and-macos-betas.html\">Beats Studio Pro</a> over-the-ear headphones, which have been rumored to arrive in mid-July. The Beats brand is owned by Apple and many of their products use Apple technologies and support Apple-exclusive features just as AirPods do. These new headphones are expected to be similar to the Studio3 with better noise cancellation and audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Amazon Prime Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348998/amazon-prime-day-apple-deals-2023.html\">bi-annual Prime Day sale</a> will be held July 11-12. We don’t know exactly which Apple products will be on sale, but we’re expecting to see 2023 low prices on MacBooks, Apple Watches, and AirPods. Stay tuned to Macworld for all the best deals during the two-day extravaganza.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 16.6 et al.:</strong> Apple has been testing <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1923832/ios-16-6-beta-features-release-date.html\">iOS 16.6</a>, along with macOS 13.5 and watchOS 9.6, for a few weeks now. There aren’t really any visible changes, though this release lays the groundwork for the iMessage Contact Key Verification security feature. That’s mostly for the kinds of users who face “extraordinary digital threats” such as government employees or activists who could be specifically targeted by state-backed hackers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 17 Public Beta:</strong> The iOS 17 developer beta was released on the first day of WWDC in June, and for the first time is available to those who have free developer accounts and not just those who pay $100 a year to be a member of the Apple Developer Program. Still, we have recommended waiting until the Public Beta if you’re curious to try it out, and that should land in July.
