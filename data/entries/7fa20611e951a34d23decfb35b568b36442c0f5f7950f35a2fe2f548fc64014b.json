There are huge exceptions, like the game industry's previously annual <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/how-the-internet-killed-e3/\">E3 conference</a>. But others, like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/the-7-most-interesting-pc-monitors-from-ces-2023/\">CES</a> consumer tech show in Las Vegas in January and the Computex computing show in Taipei this week, are still kicking and offering peeks at intriguing consumer monitor and TV tech.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>No one knows what the future of tech shows holds. The pricey, flashy E3 show, for example, was declining for years before its last in-person show in 2019. Other trade shows are enduring notable decline in exhibitor numbers, in-show announcements, and attendee numbers.</p>\n<p>This May, however, remained a time for tech trade shows. Computex started Tuesday, and The Society for Information Display (SID) held Display Week 2023 in Los Angeles last week.</p>\n<p>As a tech reporter, the fun part of trade shows isn't racking up steps or spotting slivers of time to eat and sleep. It's checking out interesting products, features, and concepts that customers will soon see. It feels somewhat odd to say in this post-pandemic world, but May was actually an interesting time for trade show displays.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943095#p3\">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943095&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7fa20611e951a34d23decfb35b568b36442c0f5f7950f35a2fe2f548fc64014b","category":"Tech"}
