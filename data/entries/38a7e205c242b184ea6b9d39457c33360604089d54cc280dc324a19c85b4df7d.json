{"title":"Grok AI Chatbot Gains Memory Feature for Smarter, Personalized Chats","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/grok-ai-chatbot-gains-memory-feature/","date":1744884295000,"content":"xAI has <a href=\"https://x.com/grok/status/1912670182012801156\">rolled out</a> a new memory feature for Grok, its conversational AI, making the chatbot smarter and more personalized over time. With memory enabled, Grok can now recall past interactions – like your preferences or previous questions – to provide more relevant recommendations and responses.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/grok-ai-logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nAccording to xAI, this feature brings Grok in line with memory capabilities already found in platforms like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/chatgpt-memory-improvements/\">ChatGPT</a> and Gemini, where chat history can be revisited and used to enhance future conversations. Users can now rely on Grok to pick up where they left off, improving long-term usability.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe memory feature is currently available in beta on the Grok website and through its iOS and Android apps. However, users in the EU and UK will have to wait, as the feature isn't yet supported in those regions. xAI says it plans to integrate memory into Grok's built-in version on X (formerly Twitter) \"soon.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Grok now remembers your conversations.
