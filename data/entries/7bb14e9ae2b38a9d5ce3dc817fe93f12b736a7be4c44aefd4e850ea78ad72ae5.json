{"title":"Elon Musk Renames Twitter to X","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/technology/twitter-x-elon-musk.html","date":1690229840000,"content":"\n<p>Ryan Mac and Tiffany Hsu, reporting for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The tech billionaire, who bought Twitter last year, renamed the\nsocial platform X.com on its website and started replacing the\nbird logo with a stylized version of the 24th letter of the Latin\nalphabet. Inside Twitter’s headquarters in San Francisco, X logos\nwere projected in the cafeteria, while conference rooms were\nrenamed to words with X in them, including “eXposure,” “eXult” and\n“s3Xy,” according to photos seen by The New York Times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is why Tesla’s vehicles are the models S, 3, X, and Y, and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/tesla-S3XY.png\">listed in that order</a> on <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/\">the company’s website</a>. It’s like the arrow in the FedEx logo but for 12-year-olds.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mr. Musk had long said he might make the name change, but he\nhastened the process in a tweet early Sunday when he declared that\n“soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all\nthe birds.” He has said he hopes to turn Twitter into an\n“everything app” called X, which would encompass not only social\nnetworking but also banking and shopping.</p>\n\n<p>Early on Monday, Mr. Musk also shared a photo of a giant X\nprojected on Twitter’s San Francisco office building with the\ncaption: “Our headquarters tonight.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I hate<sup>*</sup> to say “I told you so”, but I predicted this exact name change <a href=\"https://skeeet.xyz/?url=https://bsky.app/profile/gruber.foo/post/3jup7lhivok25\">back on May 1</a>. As I wrote when I <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/15/twitter-ceo-linda-yaccarino\">reiterated this prediction a few weeks later</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The fact that he largely refers to it now as “this platform” makes\nme think he’s going to rename it X sooner rather than later. Seems\ncrazy to me to throw away the Twitter brand name though, so maybe\n“X” will just be to Twitter what “Meta” is to Facebook and\n“Alphabet” is to Google. But also: Musk does crazy things.\nThrowing away the entire Twitter brand would be less crazy than\nhis buying it in the first place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Times piece quotes a branding expert who says the obvious, that the verbification of a brand name is exceedingly rare and exceptionally valuable. When people post to Twitter they tweet. The things they tweet are tweets. Everyone — even people who’ve never once used Twitter, knows what <em>tweet</em> means. And now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683365872323133442\">Musk thinks</a> they’ll be called “x’s”?</p>\n\n<p>Despite the fact that Musk has clearly been moving toward this name change for months — if not since before he even proposed buying the company — the changeover has been utterly (but predictably) slapdash. The new logo, which Musk claims is “interim”, is simply <a href=\"https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+1D54F\">the Unicode character “𝕏”</a> (U+1D54F, <span>MATHEMATICAL DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL X</span>). The company tried replacing the sign on its San Francisco headquarters today but <a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2023/07/24/twitter-sign-being-removed-downtown-san-francisco-office-x/\">work was halted</a> with the signage <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cabel/status/1683585476022898688\">only partially dismantled</a> over confusion as to whether the company had a work permit. Neither the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271\">iOS</a> nor <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android\">Android</a> app has been updated, and even the company’s website still says “Twitter” just about everywhere.</p>\n\n<p><small>* Where by <em>hate</em> I of course mean <em>love</em>, and I’ve been insufferably parading my Being Right Point™ for this prediction all weekend.</small></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/24/musk-twitter-x\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7bb14e9ae2b38a9d5ce3dc817fe93f12b736a7be4c44aefd4e850ea78ad72ae5","category":"Tech"}
