This means the device's rumored 7.8-inch to 8-inch inner display would have a more seamless design, for an uninterrupted viewing experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Apple looks to stand out from the competition by making the crease less noticeable when the phone is in the open position,\" he wrote.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSecond, the foldable iPhone will be equipped with a \"much higher-quality hinge\" compared to some other foldable smartphones, according to Gurman. He did not elaborate about this aspect, but Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\">previously said</a> the hinge will be made with a mix of titanium and stainless steel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\">Other foldable iPhone specs</a> that Kuo shared include a 7.8-inch inner display, a 5.5-inch outer display, two rear cameras, one front camera, a Touch ID power button instead of Face ID, and a high-density battery. He expects the device to be as thin as 4.5mm when unfolded, and between 9mm and 9.5mm when folded.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/foldable-iphone-two-key-advantages/\">Foldable iPhone Said to Have Two Key Advantages</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-said-to-have-two-key-advantages.2456532/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8efdce92893949854ad3d663968b41c5259a024cacf3eb19560fc2648a904fc1","category":"Apple"}
