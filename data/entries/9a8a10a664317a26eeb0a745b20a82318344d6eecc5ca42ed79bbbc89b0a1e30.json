{"title":"Anker, a Chinese Company, Has Already Started Raising Its Prices on Amazon","link":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-electronics-company-anker-starts-raising-prices-amazon-2025-04-11/","date":1744411257000,"content":"\n<p>Reuters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>China’s Anker, one of Amazon’s largest sellers offering products\nfrom power banks to phone cases, has raised prices on a fifth of\nits products on the U.S. platform since Thursday, in a sign that\ntariffs on Chinese goods are being passed on to U.S. shoppers.</p>\n\n<p>Some 127 Anker products have seen an average increase of 18% since\nThursday last week, with the majority of those occurring after\nMonday, April 7, when U.S. President Donald Trump added an extra\n50% import duty on Chinese goods, according to data from\ne-commerce services provider SmartScout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tariffs driving up consumer prices is as sure a thing as rain making you wet. But it’s worth pointing to the evidence as it comes in, because unlike rain’s wetness, the “emperor sure does have clothes” MAGA contingent is trying to argue that tariffs don’t have this obvious effect.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/11/anker-raising-prices\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9a8a10a664317a26eeb0a745b20a82318344d6eecc5ca42ed79bbbc89b0a1e30","category":"Tech"}
