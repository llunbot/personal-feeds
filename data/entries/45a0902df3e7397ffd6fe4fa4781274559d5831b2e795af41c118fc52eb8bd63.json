Apple’s earbuds have been steadily dropping in price all week and nearly every model is at an all-time-low heading into the biggest sales day of the year. Here are the best prices we’ve found</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods (2nd Generation): $100</a> ($29 off after automatic discount at checkout)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.costco.com/apple-airpods-(3rd-generation).product.100806298.html&amp;xcust=1-1-553670-1-545342-9934&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods (3rd Generation): $150</a> ($30 off)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods Pro: $179</a> ($70 off)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZD76NP/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods Max: $479</a> ($70 off)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We apologize in advance if any of the above models are out of stock. Product availability has been fluctuating on a daily, even hourly basis, so if something’s gone, be sure to check back throughout the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably don’t need to be reminded why AirPods are so great, but if you do, here are our reviews for the newest <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/549094/airpods-3rd-generation-review.html\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233522/airpods-pro-review.html\">AirPods Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">AirPods Max</a>. Apple’s earbuds are often on sale, but these prices represent the lowest we’ve seen and we don’t expect them to go much lower between now and Christmas. So if you want a pair, go get em while you still can.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More Apple Cyber Monday Deals!</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/541154/cyber-monday-apple-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday Apple deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553299/cyber-monday-macbook-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday MacBook deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553913/cyber-monday-mac-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday Mac deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553018/cyber-monday-iphone-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday iPhone deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/555651/cyber-monday-magsafe-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday MagSafe charger and accessory deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/554337/cyber-monday-ipad-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday iPad deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553124/cyber-monday-apple-watch-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday Apple Watch deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553143/cyber-monday-airpods-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday AirPods deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/555374/cyber-monday-apple-tv-homepod-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday Apple TV and HomePod deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/552862/cyber-monday-airtag-deals.html\">Best Cyber Monday AirTag deals</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/553617/apple-cyber-monday-sale.html\">Apple Cyber Monday sale</a></li></ul>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"45a0902df3e7397ffd6fe4fa4781274559d5831b2e795af41c118fc52eb8bd63","category":"Apple"}
