The team behind a planet-hunting telescope array called the <a href=\"https://ngtransits.org\">Next-Generation Transit Survey</a> (NGTS) is looking for help with the large volume of data the instrument has produced. The NGTS scans large areas of the sky with a collection of small, robotic telescopes to detect dips in stars' light that are caused by a planet passing between the stars and Earth.</p>\n<p>The team now has a lot of data, which it has sifted through using computers. But computers have difficulty distinguishing a likely planet from various sources of noise, so the researchers are <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mschwamb/planet-hunters-ngts\">asking the public</a> to double-check the computers and provide a final call on what a signal is.</p>\n<h2>Public transits</h2>\n<p>One of the most successful means of searching for exoplanets has been the transit method, in which a telescope repeatedly observes the amount of light originating from a star. If a planet wanders in front of that star, the amount of light will dip slightly. These dips have a very stereotypical shape if you plot them over time in what's called a light curve, with a fairly steep drop as the planet swings in front of the star, followed by a long, flat reduction.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806965#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806965&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a9b55e271d9d0abac2ff511fa4b93eddf312b5b2a903a1a4c640524c1f3be5a1","category":"Tech"}
