Apple has released new versions of the entry-level ‌iPad‌ every year since 2017, often with minor specification and chip upgrades to maintain the device's low price, so a new version for 2022 is in line with previous years. That being said, there is as yet no indication of what the tenth-generation ‌iPad‌ could feature.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nInitial rumors suggested that this year's entry-level ‌iPad‌ would feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/10/entry-level-ipad-with-larger-display-and-a13-chip/\">thinner design in a chassis similar to the iPad Air 3 and larger display</a>, but this failed to materialize with the device's launch in the fall. It is not beyond the realm of possibility to speculate that this design could instead be headed for the tenth-generation version of the ‌iPad‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile there were initially multiple rumors of an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/04/ipad-macbook-oled-displays-2022-rumor/\">iPad Air with a Samsung OLED display</a> for 2022, this device was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/02/kuo-apple-cancels-ipad-air-plans-2022/\">reportedly canceled</a> and it appears that the next ‌iPad Air‌ will stick with LCD technology.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther rumors about the fifth-generation ‌iPad Air‌ have been scant, but it seems highly likely that it will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/29/ipad-mini-tells-us-about-the-ipad-air-5/\">at least be brought up to spec with the iPad mini</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> features the A15 Bionic chip, 5G connectivity, and Center Stage. All of these aspects debuted in Apple devices after the fourth-generation ‌iPad Air‌'s introduction in September 2020, but with the ‌iPad Air‌ now being without an update for over a year, Gurman's report reaffirms the future of the device in the ‌iPad‌ lineup.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGurman also shared details about Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/05/apple-planning-five-new-macs-for-2022/\">Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/05/apple-watch-lineup-2022-se-model-rugged-model/\">Apple Watch</a> launch plans for 2022 in this week's newsletter.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/05/ipad-pro-ipad-air-5-and-ipad-10-2022/\">iPad Pro With Wireless Charging, iPad Air 5, and iPad 10 Reported to Debut in 2022</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pro-with-wireless-charging-ipad-air-5-and-ipad-10-reported-to-debut-in-2022.2326296/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pzlpIdR0QNo:bsHQuhh-QCM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pzlpIdR0QNo:bsHQuhh-QCM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5fb0c149672820a1554d7d497a78c3643d045c14f197da45e0c1c33e41cba7e3","category":"Apple"}
