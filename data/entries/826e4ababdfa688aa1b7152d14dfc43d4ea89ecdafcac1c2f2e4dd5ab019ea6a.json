{"title":"MacRumors Giveaway: Win an iPad Pro From GRID Studio","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/macrumors-giveaway-grid-studio-ipad-pro/","date":1717174427000,"content":"For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc\">GRID Studio</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>. For those unfamiliar with GRID Studio, it is a small company that crafts art out of old, discarded Apple products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/grid_frame_studio_1st_iphone_10.jpg\" width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" />\r<br />\nGRID Studio buys and recycles old electronics, taking them apart and arranging each component carefully under a glass frame. Their work turns a hodgepodge of parts into display pieces designed for Apple enthusiasts who want to own a piece of Apple's history.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe $400 <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation\">GRID 1</a> is perhaps GRID Studio's most iconic offering, featuring the original Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> from 2007. The GRID 1 includes all of the components of the first ‌iPhone‌, complete with labeling and interesting facts like all of GRID's pieces. The original ‌iPhone‌'s unmistakable housing is displayed next to the button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, ear piece, and other components, and it's particularly interesting because it was before the days when Apple started making its own chips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s\">GRID 4S</a> is an affordable way to get a piece of GRID Studio's art, as it's on sale for $99 this week. The GRID 4S was the final ‌iPhone‌ that was introduced while Steve Jobs was still alive, and the first ‌iPhone‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> launched without Jobs. The \"S\" stood for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, and it was the first ‌iPhone‌ that included the ‌Siri‌ personal assistant.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/grid-studio-iphone-4S.jpg\" width=\"2959\" height=\"1664\" />\r<br />\nFor Mac fans, the $600 <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid-macbook-air-1st-generation\">GRID MacBook Air</a> showcases the first-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> that Apple released, and it is one of GRID Studio's larger pieces at 30 inches by 18.5 inches. At the time, the 2008 ‌MacBook Air‌ was marketed world's thinnest notebook computer, and it is definitely one of Apple's most well-known later-stage Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe GRID ‌MacBook Air‌ has the machine's display at the top, followed by all of the interior components, and then the keyboard and trackpad combo. The hard drive, fan, network card, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> components are all neatly displayed, and it's a fun look at some vintage components that Apple has long since abandoned.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/grid-studio-macbook-air.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWe have an 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ for one <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
