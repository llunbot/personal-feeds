Just 300 pieces are available, including a new colour option that was chosen by public vote – an example of the commitment to participatory watchmaking that has set CODE41 apart since the very beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• <a href=\"https://code41.com/en/projects/anomaly-evolution/?utm_source=Cyclist&amp;utm_medium=8221&amp;utm_campaign=Affiliation\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more and pre-order the CODE41 ANOMALY Evolution Edition 2</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Changing the game</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Established in Lausanne, Switzerland in 2016, CODE41’s mission from the very start was to make the art of watchmaking accessible to all through a combination of community involvement and a guarantee of transparency on the prices of its watches and the origin of their components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, this approach was very much an anomaly within the traditionally secretive and exclusive world of Swiss watchmaking, hence the name of CODE41’s original collection, the ANOMALY.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-06-970x970.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-06-970x970.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-06-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-06-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-06-768x768.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-06-75x75.jpg 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-06-350x350.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-06-750x750.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-06-1140x1140.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There was the ANOMALY-01 with its distinctive, technical design, and the more traditional-looking ANOMALY-02 with its Swiss movement and date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the four years that followed, the collection sold nearly 15,000 pieces, CODE41’s novel approach to watchmaking a breath of fresh air in an industry known for its closed-doors secrecy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But trouble was looming. In 2021 the watchmaking industry was hit hard, first by Covid-19 and then by a movement crisis that made it increasingly difficult for CODE41 to acquire the movements used in the ANOMALY collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a double-whammy that would lead to the demise of more than one company in the industry, but with CODE41’s business model built around listening and responding to its customers’ needs, it quickly got to work on something entirely new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company combined the distinctive design of the 01 with the Swiss movement of the 02, and the <a href=\"https://code41.com/en/projects/anomaly-evolution/?utm_source=Cyclist&amp;utm_medium=8221&amp;utm_campaign=Affiliation\" target=\"_blank\">ANOMALY Evolution</a> was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A watch made for the people</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new model proved an instant hit, and it was no surprise. Yes, thickness was reduced by 1.5mm; watertightness increased to 100m; the display had been improved and the crown strengthened, and the use of the Sellita SW200-1 Elaboré movement meant precision was increased to -7/+7sec per day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But more than that, the ANOMALY Evolution’s success was the result of CODE41 making it exactly what people wanted it to be.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-07-970x508.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-07-970x508.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-07-300x157.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-07-768x402.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-07-750x393.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-07-1140x597.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Owners of versions 01 and 02 were invited to participate in the new model’s development, helping select the functions, design details and the materials used through a large campaign of surveys. Some were even included in the company’s work sessions, ensuring the community was at the heart of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s CODE41’s unique commitment to transparency through its TTO label (Total Transparency on Origin). The origin and actual production costs of individual components and processes are clearly explained, ensuring that the retail price is not the result of market positioning, but rather a direct reflection of the costs of production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The net result is the perfect marriage of quality and value for money: on the one hand, partners are selected who are the best in their field to create high-quality mechanical watches assembled by hand. On the other, direct distribution and minimal markups guarantee prices that more traditionally structured competitors can’t match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, when pre-orders for the ANOMALY Evolution opened in April 2021, nearly 1,000 pieces sold out in just a few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The arrival of Edition 2</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-08-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-08-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-08-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-08-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-08-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/code41-anomaly-evolution-edition-2-08.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Two years later and Edition 2 is here, with pre-orders for a limited run of just 300 individually numbered pieces set to open at 2pm UK time on 21st June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As before, the high-quality 316L steel construction is paired with a transparent back and the ANOMALY Evolution’s distinctive design to create an exceptional mechanical watch with a contemporary look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the four colourways offered with the original, CODE41 will reveal a fifth colour option as selected by a public vote.
