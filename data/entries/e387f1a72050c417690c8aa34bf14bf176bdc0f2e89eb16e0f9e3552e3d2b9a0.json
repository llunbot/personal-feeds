Dark modes, now available on most operating systems, aim to save power by making most backgrounds very dark or black, while also gratifying those who just prefer the look.</p>\n<p>But what about on the older but still dominant screen technology, LCDs? The BBC is out with <a href=\"https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/LOCO2024_paper_12.pdf\">a small, interesting study</a> comparing the light and dark modes of one of its website pages on an older laptop. Faced with a dark mode version, most people turned up the brightness a notable amount, sometimes drawing more power than on light mode.</p>\n<p>It's not a surprise that dark modes don't do anything to reduce LCD power draw. However, the study—not peer-reviewed but published as part of the <a href=\"https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/loco/loco2024/\">International Workshop on Low Carbon Computing</a>—suggests that claims about dark mode's efficiency may be overstated in real-world scenarios, with non-cutting-edge hardware and humans at the controls.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/small-study-suggests-dark-mode-doesnt-save-much-power-for-very-human-reasons/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/small-study-suggests-dark-mode-doesnt-save-much-power-for-very-human-reasons/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e387f1a72050c417690c8aa34bf14bf176bdc0f2e89eb16e0f9e3552e3d2b9a0","category":"Tech"}
