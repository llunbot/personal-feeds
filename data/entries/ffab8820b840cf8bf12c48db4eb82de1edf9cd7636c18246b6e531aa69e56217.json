NASA tapped Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos' space company, to launch the Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission with a $20 million contract.</p>\n<p>Last November, the space agency confirmed the $79 million ESCAPADE mission will launch on the inaugural flight of Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket. With this piece of information, the opaque schedule for Blue Origin's long-delayed first New Glenn mission suddenly became more clear.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043958#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043958&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ffab8820b840cf8bf12c48db4eb82de1edf9cd7636c18246b6e531aa69e56217","category":"Tech"}
