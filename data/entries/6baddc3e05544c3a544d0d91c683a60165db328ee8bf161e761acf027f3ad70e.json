These new computers include the new M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, which were also announced during the event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/new-macbook-pro-image.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1076\" />\r<br />\nEvery model of the new lineup features a Liquid Retina XDR display with 20 percent brighter SDR content, a built-in 1080p camera, and a six speaker sound system. The new MacBook Pros offer up to 22 hours of battery life as well. The display also features 1,000 nits sustained and 1,600 nits of peak brightness for HDR content.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe standard M3 chip has up to an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU, the M3 Pro chip has up to a 12-core CPU and up to a 18-core GPU, and the M3 Max chip has up to a 16-core CPU and up to a 40-core GPU. The M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips support up to 24GB, 36GB, and 128GB of unified memory, respectively.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says that the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro is up to 60 percent faster than the 13-inch MacBook Pro with M1. For users with more demanding workflows, the 14-inch and 16-inch M3 Pro MacBook Pro is up to 40 percent faster than the 16-inch model with M1 Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/new-macbook-pro-image-2.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nFor ultimate performance, the 14-inch and 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro models offer up to 2.5x faster speeds than the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Max, and up to 11x faster speeds than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips are built using 3-nanometer technology and offer a faster, more efficient next-generation GPU. They feature \"Dynamic Caching\" technology, meaning the GPU allocates the use of local memory in hardware in real time, ensuring only the exact amount of memory needed is used for each task.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBesides the internal upgrades, there's also a new color in the MacBook Pro lineup: Space Black. Only M3 Pro and M3 Max versions of the computer are available in Space Black. Apple says the finish greatly reduces fingerprints thanks to an anodization seal. M3 Pro and M3 Max models also come in Silver, and the 14-inch M3 model comes in Silver and Space Gray.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new MacBook Pro models are available to order today, and they will launch on Tuesday, November 7.
