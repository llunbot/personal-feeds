With MacBook Airs in the rear-view mirror and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC</a> just a month away, there didn’t seem to be enough products to fill an hour-long keynote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out the rumors were right. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, writing in his <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-05/apple-may-7-let-loose-ipad-event-apple-should-turn-ipad-into-laptop-replacement-lvtj00n9&amp;xcust=1-1-2324521-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">weekly Power On newsletter</a>, the Let Loose event “is expected to be about 35 minutes,” significantly shorter than other recent spring events:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Peek Performance, March 8, 2022: 59 minutes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spring Loaded, April 20, 2021: 61 minutes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Show time, March 25, 2019: 109 minutes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Field trip, March 27, 2018: 67 minutes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has billed Let Loose as “a different kind of Apple event,” so it’s possible Apple still has something exciting up its sleeve. It could also be a sign that Apple is moving toward shorter-focused events. Its last event, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2119519/apple-scary-fast-event-live-updates-mac-macbook-magic-mouse.html\">Scary Fast in October</a>, was also about a half-hour and was dedicated to the MacBook Pro and M3 processor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to unveil significant updates to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/2024-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">iPad Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">iPad Air</a> at the event, as well as a new Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard. To help promote the event, which takes place at 7 a.m. PT on May 7, Apple added an interactive teaser to its home page that lets users erase the animated Apple logos before another is redrawn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how you can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2323134/how-to-watch-let-loose-ipad-apple-event-may-7.html\">watch Apple’s Let Loose event on May 7</a>.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9359554cac13c320a7cce9d983136b3fbcc416d38f47bb4338368816a2515cae","category":"Apple"}
