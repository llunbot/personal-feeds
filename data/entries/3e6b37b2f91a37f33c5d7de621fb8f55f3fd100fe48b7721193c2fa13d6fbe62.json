{"title":"Former Designer of Google Maps on Its Updated Design","link":"https://twitter.com/elizlaraki/status/1727351922254852182","date":1700698442000,"content":"\n<p>Elizabeth Laraki, in an article-length post on Twitter/X</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>15 years ago, I helped design Google Maps. I still use it \neveryday. Last week, the team dramatically changed the map’s \nvisual design. I don’t love it. It feels colder, less accurate and \nless human. But more importantly, they missed a key opportunity to \nsimplify and scale. [...] </p>\n\n<p>So much stuff has accumulated on top of the map. Currently there \nare ~11 different elements obscuring it: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Search box </li>\n<li>8 pills overlayed in 4 rows </li>\n<li>A peeking card for “latest in the area” </li>\n<li>A bottom nav bar </li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a very long way of saying that Google Maps’s app design should be like Apple Maps. In fact, Apple Maps has <em>fewer</em> UI elements obtruding actual map content than she’s proposing for Google Maps.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/22/google-maps-design\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3e6b37b2f91a37f33c5d7de621fb8f55f3fd100fe48b7721193c2fa13d6fbe62","category":"Tech"}
