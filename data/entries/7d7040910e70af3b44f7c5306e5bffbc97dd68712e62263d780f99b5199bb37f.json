The 160mm travel is my preferred starting point to discuss the new Bosch powered bikes, because even though it is really an all-new ebike, it has something of an analogue in Merida’s previous popular e160 platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with a lighter carbon frame, a lighter and smoother pedal assist via Bosch’s CX motor, and the smallest battery that Merida has put in an eMTB yet… the new eOne-Sixty SL feels a lot more like a regular all-mountain bike. And it likely will appeal to mountain bikers turned off by the extra heft of most full-powered ebikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 Merida eOne-Sixty SL lightweight Bosch SX eMTB</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Merida-e160-SL-8000-eMTB_lightweight-160mm-carbon-Bosch-SX-powered-all-mountain-eBike.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Merida-e160-SL-8000-eMTB_lightweight-160mm-carbon-Bosch-SX-powered-all-mountain-eBike.jpg\" alt=\"Merida eOne-Sixty SL lightweight Bosch SX eMTB, e160SL 8000 complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Merida-e160-SL-8000-eMTB_lightweight-160mm-carbon-Bosch-SX-powered-all-mountain-eBike.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Merida-e160-SL-8000-eMTB_lightweight-160mm-carbon-Bosch-SX-powered-all-mountain-eBike-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Merida-e160-SL-8000-eMTB_lightweight-160mm-carbon-Bosch-SX-powered-all-mountain-eBike-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Merida-e160-SL-8000-eMTB_lightweight-160mm-carbon-Bosch-SX-powered-all-mountain-eBike-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Merida-e160-SL-8000-eMTB_lightweight-160mm-carbon-Bosch-SX-powered-all-mountain-eBike-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new carbon Merida eOne-Sixty SL is a full 29er Bosch SX-powered light-support eMTB, with a 400Wh internal battery, and the option for a 250Wh external range extender if you need it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This past spring Merida lightened up their popular Shimano EP8-powered <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/merida-emtb-eone-sixty-eone-forty-ebike-range/\" target=\"_blank\">eOne-Sixty</a> all-mountain to enduro ebike with a carbon frame, bigger battery options, and longer travel than its name would suggest.

It is no doubt an ebike when you realize how much faster you can get to the top of the hill with 250W of normalized power (and 600W peak power) boosting your legs. But when you head downhill again, the extra weight compared to a regular all-mountain or enduro bike seems to almost disappear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is certainly one of the more balanced-feeling and more capable-feeling ebikes I have tested. And while you genuinely have to put in some effort to get it up the mountain, going down is as playful and natural feeling as a regular mountain bike. There’s really doesn’t feel like there’s a lot of compromise here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for a more in-depth review of how this 20.4kg Merida eOne-Sixty SL 8000 rides, how it feels, and what I see as its down sides.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2025 Merida eOne-Sixty SL – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Sixty-SL-6000-ebike-complete_lightweight-carbon-Bosch-SX-powered-all-mountain-eBike-eMTB_clay-gold-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Sixty-SL-6000-ebike-complete_lightweight-carbon-Bosch-SX-powered-all-mountain-eBike-eMTB_clay-gold-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Merida eOne-Sixty SL eMTB, lightweight carbon Bosch SX-powered all-mountain ebike, 6000\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Sixty-SL-6000-ebike-complete_lightweight-carbon-Bosch-SX-powered-all-mountain-eBike-eMTB_clay-gold-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Sixty-SL-6000-ebike-complete_lightweight-carbon-Bosch-SX-powered-all-mountain-eBike-eMTB_clay-gold-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Sixty-SL-6000-ebike-complete_lightweight-carbon-Bosch-SX-powered-all-mountain-eBike-eMTB_clay-gold-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Sixty-SL-6000-ebike-complete_lightweight-carbon-Bosch-SX-powered-all-mountain-eBike-eMTB_clay-gold-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Merida-eOne-Sixty-SL-6000-ebike-complete_lightweight-carbon-Bosch-SX-powered-all-mountain-eBike-eMTB_clay-gold-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>2025 Merida eOne-Sixty SL 6000</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new lightweight Merida eOne-Sixty SL ebike with its carbon frame, Bosch Performance SX motor &amp; 400Wh internal battery comes in just 3 spec levels, 5 sizes, and 5 different colors depending on spec.
