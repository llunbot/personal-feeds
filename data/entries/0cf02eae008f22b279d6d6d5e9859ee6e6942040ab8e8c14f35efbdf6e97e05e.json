Justin and Remi have a knack for adventure and we are proud to supply them with Moots bikes to get them there and back. In the third film: AUZANGATE, our adventurers are riding the Moots WOMBLE to new heights. Settle in, stream it to a big screen if you can and enjoy the sights, sounds and culture of their Peruvian immersion.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/@analogstrikesback_20210718__IWM8958-copy.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>If you find yourself in Cusco Peru, and look to the east, you’ll see a snow-capped mountain, most likely more massive than any mountain you have ever seen. The mountain has been the guardian, the giver of life, the Apu of not only Cusco, but all the communities that live in its shadow. This mountain is known as Auzangate. At 20,945ft Auzangate is the 5th highest mountain in the Peruvian Andes, and is home to of the last remaining pastoral societies in the world.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/@analogstrikesback_20210719__IWM9279-copy.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The goal of Shared Territory is, and always has been, to connect with others with the hope of better understanding the shared experiences that make us all human. In our 3rd film, Auzangate we set out on an expedition with a team of Peruvians, led by a local fortune teller, to circumnavigate this mountain and document the people and places we found. What we found was an unrelenting mountain that had a different plan for us.<span> </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/@analogstrikesback_20210713__IWM5158-copy.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The story that Auzangate wanted to tell was a story of human generosity at its absolute best. When you visit Peru, please connect with Fidaluz of “Peru Ancestral” and Manuel of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/perubybike/\">“Peru by Bike”</a>. Not only did they help with the depth of this story, but they are also some of the greatest folks you spend time with. They will take your journey in Peru to new heights. Like 18,000 feet heights! <a href=\"https://peruancestral.com\">Peru Ancestral by Bike – </a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/@analogstrikesback_20210717__IWM7577-copy.jpg\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/@analogstrikesback_20210715__IWM6674-copy.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://moots.com/shared-territory-auzangate-peru/\">SHARED TERRITORY AUZANGATE–PERU</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://moots.com\">Moots</a>.</p>","author":"Jon Cariveau","siteTitle":"Moots","siteHash":"dbee4c0f87f6913283dcacd1f8b3e2603e0d744c0d8d7eea7b1691bee838c4cd","entryHash":"0cf02eae008f22b279d6d6d5e9859ee6e6942040ab8e8c14f35efbdf6e97e05e","category":"Cycling"}
