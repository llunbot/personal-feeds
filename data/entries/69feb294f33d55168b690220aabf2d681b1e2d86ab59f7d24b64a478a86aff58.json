Britain enjoyed great TT success with Zoe Bäckstedt beating Germany’s Antonia Niedermaier by 57 seconds in the U23 Women’s Time-Trial while <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-vuelta-espana-1\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Tarling</a> stormed to victory in the Men’s Elite Time-Trial, seeing off competition from Switzerland’s Stefan Bissegger by 42 seconds and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a> by 43 seconds. His gold medal comes just one month after he finished third in the same discipline at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uci-world-championships\" target=\"_blank\">UCI World Championships</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Elite Men’s Road Race was the last event on the schedule and France’s Christophe Laporte just about pulled off a suspenseful solo breakaway. He was caught by the chasing group of Van Aert, Arnaud De Lie (Belgium) and Olav Kooij (Netherlands) in the last kilometre. As Van Aert looked to come over the top of Laporte in the final 100m the Frenchman dug deep to kick again and stay ahead of his Jumbo-Visma teammate. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Junior Women Time Trial:</strong> Federica Venturelli (Italy)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Junior Men Time Trial:</strong> Albert Philipsen (Denmark)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>U23 Women Time Trial:</strong> Zoe Bäckstedt (Great Britain)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>U23 Men Time Trial:</strong> Alec Segaert (Belgium)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Elite Women Time Trial:</strong> Marlen Reusser (Switzerland)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Elite Men Time Trial: </strong>Josh Tarling (Great Britain)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Junior Mixed Team Relay:</strong> Italy</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Elite Mixed Team Relay:</strong> France</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Junior Women Road Race:</strong> Fleur Moors (Belgium)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Junior Men Road Race:</strong> Anže Ravbar (Slovenia)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>U-23 Women Road Race:</strong> Ilse Pluimers (Netherlands)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>U-23 Men Road Race:</strong> Henrik Breiner Pedersen (Denmark)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Elite Women Road Race: </strong>Mischa Bredewold (Netherlands)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Elite Men Road Race:</strong> Christophe Laporte (France)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jumbo-Visma and Soudal-QuickStep merger rumours</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/07113604/lefevere_profile_1-970x495.jpg\" alt=\"lefevere_profile_1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/07113604/lefevere_profile_1-970x495.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/07113604/lefevere_profile_1-300x153.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/07113604/lefevere_profile_1-768x392.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/07113604/lefevere_profile_1-1536x783.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/07113604/lefevere_profile_1-750x383.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/07113604/lefevere_profile_1-1140x581.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/07113604/lefevere_profile_1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sean Hardy</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dutch cycling news outlet <a href=\"https://www.wielerflits.nl/nieuws/jumbo-visma-werkt-aan-fusie-met-soudal-quick-step/\" target=\"_blank\">WielerFlits</a> broke the news that the Jumbo-Visma and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/soudal-quickstep\" target=\"_blank\">Soudal-QuickStep</a> teams could merge into one squad from 2024. Raymond Kerckhoffs reported that Jumbo-Visma general manager Richard Plugge would become CEO with senior DS Merijn Zeeman slotting into a head coach role and Soudal-QuickStep’s Patrick Lefevere moving into a board position.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of riders and staff could face uncertainty as the story unfolds as one full men’s cycling team roster carries around 30 riders, then you factor in both men’s and women’s teams and development teams.

His pregnant wife Alicia was also in the car but was unharmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After recovering in hospital, Van Hooydonck was diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia and fitted with an internal defibrillator. In a statement released by Jumbo-Visma, he said, ‘I’m fine now, but I still have to deal with the fact that this marks the end of my professional career. I would like to express my gratitude to the people who helped me, the medical team at the hospital and all the fans who sent me messages. I will now focus on my recovery and my upcoming fatherhood. Everything is going well with Alicia and the pregnancy, and we eagerly anticipate the birth. That really helps me now.’</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CxgOMPysYFY/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CxgOMPysYFY/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Nathan Van Hooydonck (@nvhooydonck)</a></p></div></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>In good news, the couple announced the birth of their son, Alessio, three days ago and described him as ‘our little miracle’. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cat Ferguson to join Movistar</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f467-1f3fb.png\" alt=\"👧🏻\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1ec-1f1e7.png\" alt=\"🇬🇧\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/270d.png\" alt=\"✍\" />2⃣0⃣2⃣7⃣<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2757.png\" alt=\"❗\" /><br /><br />We welcome 17-year-old sensation Cat Ferguson to the Movistar Team with a long-term contract: starts August 2024 as a trainee, then three seasons in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UCI_WWT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@uci_wwt</a>.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RodamosJuntos?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#RodamosJuntos</a></p>— Movistar Team (@Movistar_Team) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Movistar_Team/status/1704057755219243492?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">September 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>British rising star Cat Ferguson will join <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/movistar\" target=\"_blank\">Movistar</a> as a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/towards-fair-pay-for-stagiaires\" target=\"_blank\">stagiaire</a> in 2024.
