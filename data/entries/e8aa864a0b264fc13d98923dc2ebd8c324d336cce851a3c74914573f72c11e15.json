Kudzu: smothering trees and houses, growing a foot a day. Burmese pythons: stripping the Everglades of small animals. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/copi-invasive-species-rebranding-campaign/\">Asian carp</a>: hoovering streams clean of plankton and swimming toward the Great Lakes.</p>\n<p>They all came from somewhere else, arrived with no natural predators, outcompeted local flora and fauna, and took over whole ecosystems. But they all have their limitations: Kudzu dies in a hard freeze, carp can’t tolerate salt water, and pythons can’t cover long distances very fast. (Thankfully.)</p>\n<p>Now imagine a species with all those benefits—foreign origin, no enemies—and no roadblocks to dominance: One that is indifferent to temperature, comfortable in many landscapes, able to run a lot faster than you, and muscular enough to leave a big dent in your car. That describes any of the possibly 6 million feral hogs in the United States, the most intractable invasives that most people have never heard of.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925885#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925885&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e8aa864a0b264fc13d98923dc2ebd8c324d336cce851a3c74914573f72c11e15","category":"Tech"}
