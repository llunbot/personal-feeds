That speed of that wireless connection was a major focus for Fox on the Transfer Neo, and they’ve managed to come up with a solution that is the “fastest wireless connectivity in cycling” – at least, according to Fox. They claim that their wireless protocol is over 100x faster than Bluetooth and 20x faster than their closest competitor – just 26 milliseconds from lever press to post movement. Fox doesn’t go into any more detail here, but it’s assumed that they’re using some kind of proprietary system that they intend to keep under wraps… at least for now (more on this below).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to this fastest wireless protocol, Fox claims there is “virtually zero latency between actuating the dropper lever and your post moving.” </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ergonomic Lever</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Neo-Lever-MY25.22-0902-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Neo-Lever-MY25.22-0902-1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"Fox Transfer Neo wireless dropper lever\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Neo-Lever-MY25.22-0902-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Neo-Lever-MY25.22-0902-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Neo-Lever-MY25.22-0902-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Neo-Lever-MY25.22-0902-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Neo-Lever-MY25.22-0902-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The lever they’re referring to is the new Ergonomic Neo Lever which is designed to feel very familiar instead of just placing a button on your bar. You’ll find a rubber-coated thumb pad with a similar texture and distance from the bar, but with a (6x) shorter lever throw. According to Fox, this means you can rotate the lever further under the bar for better clearance with your knuckles, while still offering easy actuation. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post5-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post5-1536x1025.jpg\" alt=\"Fox Neo Transfer wireless dropper post lever\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post5-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post5-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post5-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post5-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post5-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post3-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post3-1536x1025.jpg\" alt=\"Fox Neo Transfer wireless dropper post lever\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post3-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post3-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post3-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it’s still technically a button in lever form, the lever offers haptic feedback so that you know when you’ve pressed the lever – just like your favorite video game controller. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Containing a CR2032 battery with tool-free replacement, the lever has an expected 1-year battery life. The lever also sits just 36mm below the bar, which Fox points out is 10mm less than the competition. Why does that matter? Depending on your handlebar position, that could mean the difference between the lever hitting the bike’s top tube in a crash, or gliding over it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lever has an unspecified amount of lateral adjustment and comes with standard 22.2mm round, Matchmaker, and I-Spec EV clamps to allow you to position it as needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Transfer-NEO-31-6-MY25-Dynamic-Hero-v2-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Transfer-NEO-31-6-MY25-Dynamic-Hero-v2-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"Fox Transfer Neo rendering\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Transfer-NEO-31-6-MY25-Dynamic-Hero-v2-Large.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Transfer-NEO-31-6-MY25-Dynamic-Hero-v2-Large-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Transfer-NEO-31-6-MY25-Dynamic-Hero-v2-Large-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Transfer-NEO-31-6-MY25-Dynamic-Hero-v2-Large-768x768.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and if your lever battery dies, you can still drop the post manually by pressing and holding the button on the post controller until the LED turns white (press again to finish actuation). </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s up with that battery position?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post9-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"2301\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post9-1536x2301.jpg\" alt=\"Fox Neo Transfer wireless dropper post collar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post9-1536x2301.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post9-80x120.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post9-768x1150.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post9-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post9-1367x2048.jpg 1367w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post9-scaled.jpg 1709w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post7-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post7-1536x1025.jpg\" alt=\"Fox Neo Transfer wireless dropper post collar back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post7-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post7-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post7-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post7-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post7-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post7-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post7-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post2-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post2-1536x1025.jpg\" alt=\"Fox Neo Transfer wireless dropper post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post2-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-Neo-wireless-dropper-post2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most obvious features of the Transfer Neo is the positioning of the battery. Instead of attaching it to the saddle clamp end of the post, the Fox Neo battery sits at the top of the post’s lower, just above the seat post clamp. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Neo-Transfer-details1.png\"><img width=\"836\" height=\"505\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Neo-Transfer-details1.png\" alt=\"Fox Neo Transfer details tire clearance\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Neo-Transfer-details1.png 836w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Neo-Transfer-details1-297x179.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Neo-Transfer-details1-120x72.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Neo-Transfer-details1-768x464.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fox positioned it here for two reasons: it helped to reduce the stack height, and allows for increased tire clearance. On a full-suspension bike at full bottom-out with your dropper post fully dropped, tire clearance comes down to millimeters. 6mm to be exact, which is the recommended ISO tire clearance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fox states that for their nearest competitor to have this clearance at the battery, “posts must be run as much as 18mm above full insertion. This position—combined with taller stack height—means your saddle height sits 40mm higher than Transfer Neo when fully compressed.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated Fox Transfer dropper posts already had excellent stack heights, and the Fox Transfer Neo adds just 11mm to their mechanical posts’ stack height. When measured from the bottom of the controller to the center of the saddle rails, this distance is a claimed 18mm less than the RockShox Reverb AXS. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Future Fox Neo Products Incoming?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Transfer-NEO-31-6-MY25-Battery-Eject-r1-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Transfer-NEO-31-6-MY25-Battery-Eject-r1-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"Fox Transfer Neo rendering battery\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Transfer-NEO-31-6-MY25-Battery-Eject-r1-Large.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Transfer-NEO-31-6-MY25-Battery-Eject-r1-Large-297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Transfer-NEO-31-6-MY25-Battery-Eject-r1-Large-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Transfer-NEO-31-6-MY25-Battery-Eject-r1-Large-768x768.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In a tease of what’s to come, Fox calls out the fact that the Transfer Neo uses a “Fox-specific battery with <em>compatibility for future Neo Products</em>.” Clearly, Fox must be working on something else that uses batteries. Given that the previous generation of Fox Live Valve relied on a fairly large battery, it seems safe to assume that the Neo battery may be headed in that direction (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/patent-patrol-fox-live-valve-is-about-to-get-a-lot-more-active/\" target=\"_blank\">recent patents</a> suggest big changes are coming). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That Neo battery can be removed from the seatpost, and charged using the included dock. Fox says charging time will take from 1.25-1.5 hours. A full charge is expected to deliver 30-40 hours of ride time depending on the frequency of dropper post actuations. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>There’s an app too</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-neo-app-controls2.jpg\"><img width=\"8640\" height=\"5760\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-neo-app-controls2.jpg\" alt=\"Fox Transfer neo app controls2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-neo-app-controls2.jpg 8640w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-neo-app-controls2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-neo-app-controls2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-neo-app-controls2-768x512.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-neo-app-controls1.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-neo-app-controls1-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Fox Transfer neo app controls1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-neo-app-controls1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-neo-app-controls1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-neo-app-controls1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fox-Transfer-neo-app-controls1-768x512.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the app allows you to activate Bike Park Mode, and Transport Mode. If you want to drop your post and avoid accidental actuation when charging down the bike park, Bike Park Mode temporarily disables your Transfer Neo Dropper lever. To get it back, just hit the lever 4x rapidly, or open the app. Transport mode shuts down the “shake to wake” feature to prevent the battery from draining while traveling. To disable, simply bounce the rear of your bike off the ground or remove the and reinsert the battery. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “shake to wake” feature also means there’s no need for a power button, just jump on and go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who read our recent <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/patent-patrol-fox-wireless-droppers-infinite-stepped-travel-to-get-voice-auto-gps-drop/\" target=\"_blank\">Patent Patrol article on the Fox Wireless dropper</a> may be disappointed to see that features like voice-control, GPS-based auto drops, and stepped or infinite dropping didn’t make the cut, but remember, now that the post is electronic, it opens up the possibility of future firmware updates.
