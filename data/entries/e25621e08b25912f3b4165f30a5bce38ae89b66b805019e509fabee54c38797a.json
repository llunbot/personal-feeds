In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jszumski/status/1456715133615579140?s=20\">a tweet</a>, Szumski said that Twitter will be rolling out fully-maxed-out MacBook Pros to all of its iOS and Android engineers. Szumski added that the new Apple silicon Macs are showing significant improvements in top-line performance for Twitter's app development compared to currently used Intel Macs. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>I'm excited to be rolling out fully loaded M1 Max MBPs to all of Twitter's iOS &amp; Android engineers! We're seeing improvements in both top line performance and thermal throttling that currently plague our Intel builds.</p>— John Szumski (@jszumski) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jszumski/status/1456715133615579140?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 5, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nAn engineer at Reddit also shared a similar sentiment. Jameson, a staff engineer at Reddit, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/softwarejameson/status/1455971162060697613?s=20\">said</a> that the new MacBook Pros have cut Reddit's app build time by 50%, yielding improved productivity for engineers. Breaking down the cost of deploying new MacBook Pros to Reddit's engineers, Jameson said, \"for a team of 9, $32k of laptops will actually save $100k in productivity over 2022.\" \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple promises considerable improvements for developers with the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/\">M1 Pro</a> and ‌M1 Max‌ Apple silicon chips. According to tests done by Apple, the 10-core CPU ‌M1 Pro‌ and ‌M1 Max‌ chips in the large 16-inch MacBook Pro offer 3.7 faster build times than the 8-core Intel i9 16-inch MacBook Pro. In terms of power efficiency and battery life, Apple says the new chips allow developers to \"compile up to four times as much code in Xcode\" on a single battery charge.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14 &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/reddit/\">Reddit</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/08/twitter-engineers-macbook-pro-m1-max/\">Twitter Deploying Top-Spec MacBook Pros Across App Development Teams</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/twitter-deploying-top-spec-macbook-pros-across-app-development-teams.2322345/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=T_hDjI7ymVM:zd-HAClpBso:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=T_hDjI7ymVM:zd-HAClpBso:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/T_hDjI7ymVM\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e25621e08b25912f3b4165f30a5bce38ae89b66b805019e509fabee54c38797a","category":"Apple"}
