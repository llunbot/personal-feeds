CaseBorne is having a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/mpc/A2HFPF4GWZO38E\">40 percent off sale on Amazon</a>, so its case options are super affordable right now. Discounts are applied at checkout when using the links in our article.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/mpc/A2ADRQRAACHCAR\">R Series cases</a>, priced at $20 with the discount, are made from a clear polycarbonate material that leaves the body of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> visible so you're not hiding the smartphone's design.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/caseborne-r-series-info.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cases feature soft rubber inside to absorb shock should the ‌iPhone‌ be dropped, and the case is enclosed in a protective aluminum frame available in iridescent, black, pink, and red. A raised lip protects the front of the display, and all buttons are protected but usable. It offers 12-foot drop protection without adding a significant amount of bulk.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/caseborne-r-series-carbon-fiber.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nCaseBorne also makes the R Series cases <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/mpc/A3DV9O50VTD5YM\">with a Kevlar/Aramid Fiber frame</a> as an alternative to the clear polycarbonate, with this version available in black or red and priced at $24 with the discount.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor those who need maximum protection, CaseBorne offers <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/mpc/A2HFPF4GWZO38E\">the Vanguard Series cases</a>, which are thicker and more rugged. Priced at $14 with the discount, the V Series cases offer three layers of protection and can keep the ‌iPhone‌ safe from drops as high as 21 feet.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/caseborne-v-series-info.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's a shock absorbent TPU material that combines with a hard plastic shell for total device protection, and the honeycomb design and reinforced corners provide additional protection for the ‌iPhone‌'s weak spots. There's a protective screen and the sides protect the buttons, plus plug-ins keep ports safe from dust.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/caseborne-v-series-details.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe V Series cases come in black, orange, purple, and red, and there's a built-in kickstand at the back that can be pulled out when using the ‌iPhone‌ to watch videos.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/v-series-caseborne.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have one 128GB ‌iPhone 13‌ to give away, and the winner will be able to pick the color of their choice.
