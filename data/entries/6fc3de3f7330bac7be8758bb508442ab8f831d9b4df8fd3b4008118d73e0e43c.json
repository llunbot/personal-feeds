King Ti headsets only pop up every few years, and in very limited quantities. So, while even their regular rainbow of anodized aluminum headset cups are “<em>built to last a lifetime, fully serviceable, and backed by [their] lifetime built-to-last warranty</em>“, these titanium versions take it to the next level. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to really make your bike happy, get it a King Titanium DropSet!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Chris King Titanium DropSet forever headset for modern bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_ti-top-cap-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_ti-top-cap-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Chris King Titanium DropSet forever headset for modern bikes, ti topcap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_ti-top-cap-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_ti-top-cap-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_ti-top-cap-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_ti-top-cap-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_ti-top-cap-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_ti-top-cap-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Chris King)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s probably been more than 15 years since we really started to see integrated headsets take off in a big way, driven first by more carbon frames and then by tapered steerer tubes. But it’s only been 6 years since Chris King got into the integrated headset game with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/chris-king-finally-adds-integrated-headset-with-new-dropset-1/\" target=\"_blank\">their original DropSet,</a> solving the variable bearing preload problem with their patented GripLock wedge system. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Chris King Titanium DropSet forever headset for modern bikes, spread out\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to GripLock is its independent preload of the headset’s loosely dropped-in bearings separately of how it clamps against your steerer tube, so that the bearings stay preloaded as you ride, making it “impervious to the ill effects of load spikes from large hits and heavy braking”. The result is an integrated headset that  in the process created some of the longest-lasting integrated headsets that have ever been made.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Most of the new, carbon road and gravel bikes have internal bearing designs. When bearings aren’t pressed securely into a cup they shift and move and lose preload, which makes them move, creak, and eventually fail. The DropSet solves that problem.”</p>\n<cite><em>–  Jay Sycip, Chris King Design Manager</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, Chris King are finally offering these integrated DropSet headsets in rare and sought-after titanium!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Chris King Titanium DropSet headsets – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_headset-stack-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_headset-stack-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Chris King Titanium DropSet forever headset for modern bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_headset-stack-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_headset-stack-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_headset-stack-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_headset-stack-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_headset-stack-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_headset-stack-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chris-King-Titanium-DropSet-forever-headset-for-modern-bikes_headset-stack-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Chris King Titanium DropSet comes in 4 models – <a href=\"http://chrisking.com/products/dropset\" target=\"_blank\">DropSet 2, 3, 4 &amp; 6</a> to fit most modern road, gravel &amp; mountain bikes with a tapered steerer tube and integrated headset. (Not fully integrated internal cable routing, which would need the different <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=aeroset\" target=\"_blank\">AeroSet</a>.) Each sells for the same $300 in matte ti with a ti heasdet cap &amp; bolt, a 40% premium over the standard colorful alloy versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don’t elaborate on how many of each headset they will make in titanium, but my past experience is that they will most certainly sell out. And likely it won’t take too long until they are gone. Then you may have to wait 5 or even 10 years until they pop up again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are headsets that will outlast your bike. And these are headsets that you’ll maybe even take from bike to bike over the years. Snap one up now to add some bling to your current bike, and possibly even to your next bikes down the road or trail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Review: A lifetime King Ti NoThreadSet titanium headset</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_atop-Madonna-del-Ghisallo-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_atop-Madonna-del-Ghisallo-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Review: King Ti NoThreadSet titanium headset, on Soma cyclocross bike atop the Madonna del Ghisallo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_atop-Madonna-del-Ghisallo-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_atop-Madonna-del-Ghisallo-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_atop-Madonna-del-Ghisallo-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_atop-Madonna-del-Ghisallo-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_atop-Madonna-del-Ghisallo-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(review photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The King Ti headset I’m actually reviewing here is around 20 years old, and has been pressed into several bikes over those decades. And yes, it intentionally has the symmetrical cups pressed in upside down. Blame that on old bike shop rat traditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it’s on an old-school Soma Double Cross S&amp;S-coupled canti all-rounder that I’ve been riding since around 2002, and has done everything from racing cyclocross to classic all-road riding &amp; touring to what we now call gravel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s had this headset in it since it got repainted in 2015. And the bike’s been ridden in about 6 or 7 European countries since then. Here it was on top of the Madonna del Ghisallo for its road-style cycling pilgrimage – testing pre-production versions of Vittoria’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/exclusive-first-ride-vittoria-corsa-tires-and-quarano-carbon-tubulars/\" target=\"_blank\">first-ever Graphene-infused Corsa tubular</a> tires. But it’s back as more of an off-road gravel touring bike these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_upper-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_upper-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Review: King Ti NoThreadSet titanium headset, on Soma cyclocross bike top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_upper-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_upper-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_upper-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_upper-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_upper-jpg.webp 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_upside-down-lower-cup-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_upside-down-lower-cup-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Review: King Ti NoThreadSet titanium headset, on Soma cyclocross bike, upside down bottom\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_upside-down-lower-cup-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_upside-down-lower-cup-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_upside-down-lower-cup-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_upside-down-lower-cup-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review-King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset_upside-down-lower-cup-jpg.webp 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The headset was in two different mountain bikes before this. First in a full-sus Kona trail bike I think, then a ti XC softail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it still spins as smoothly as when it was new, having realistically had only 2 or maybe 3 full tear-down services in its lifetime, so far. Bearings opened up, cleaned, regreased, and reassembled. Even the one time that it looked like I had waited too long, a good soak in degreaser and it was shiny like new a couple days later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there’s plenty of lifetimes left in both these titanium cups and the precision stainless steel Chris King bearings inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review_King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset-in-old-Soma-Double-Cross-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review_King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset-in-old-Soma-Double-Cross-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Review: King Ti NoThreadSet titanium headset, on old Soma Double Cross cyclocross allrounder bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review_King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset-in-old-Soma-Double-Cross-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review_King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset-in-old-Soma-Double-Cross-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review_King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset-in-old-Soma-Double-Cross-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review_King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset-in-old-Soma-Double-Cross-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review_King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset-in-old-Soma-Double-Cross-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review_King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset-in-old-Soma-Double-Cross-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Review_King-Ti-NoThreadSet-titanium-headset-in-old-Soma-Double-Cross-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty of the 1 1/18″ threadless standard was that there have been tons of bikes coming in and out of my workshop in those past 20 years that could fit this headset. Even though tapered steerers have taken over for the most part, there will always be frames to fit this headset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that integrated headsets are a bit closer to being standardized, a ti DropSet means being more likely to fit your next bike too! Looking around the house, both my wife and I have a gravel bike and a mountain bike that could fit a Titanium DropSet. The hardest decision would be picking which bike deserved it first!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chrisking.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ChrisKing.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/chris-king-titanium-dropset-returns-sought-after-ti-headset-for-modern-bikes-review/\">Chris King Titanium DropSet Returns Sought-After Ti Headset for Modern Bikes: Review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6fc3de3f7330bac7be8758bb508442ab8f831d9b4df8fd3b4008118d73e0e43c","category":"Cycling"}
