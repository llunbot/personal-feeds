The 32-inch display has a sleek stand with adjustable height, and almost no bezels at all. Launch date and price aren't available just yet. Samsung also had the Smart Monitor M9, a 4K OLED display with an AI Picture Optimizer feature that makes adjustments based on what's on the screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTP-Link's Tapo brand had some interesting security cameras and locks, including one that's able to verify your identity by reading the veins in your palm before unlocking the door. The cameras aren't <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> or Matter-enabled, but Tapo has detailed notifications that give you insight into what's going on rather than just a standard motion detected alert.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for Apple-related accessories, Satechi's 3-in-1 magnetic travel chargers in bright colors were a win and SanDisk showed off a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> SSD with USB-C that's perfect for transferring content from your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or recording video directly to the external drive.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOhSnap demoed a ‌MagSafe‌ wallet that has a super strong grip and can hold up to eight cards, and for ‌HomeKit‌ users, Flic Duo had a Matter-compatible button that supports gesture control for controlling your devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther highlights included Honda and Sony's Afeela electric vehicle, the cord-free Displace TV, and a spoon that zaps your tongue to make you taste salt so you can cut down on sodium.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor all of the news from ‌CES 2025‌, make sure to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2025/\">check out our CES 2025 hub</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2025/\">CES 2025</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/best-of-ces-2025/\">Best of CES 2025: LG 6K Display, SanDisk MagSafe SSD, Satechi Chargers and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/best-of-ces-2025-lg-6k-display-sandisk-magsafe-ssd-satechi-chargers-and-more.2447156/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"13f748ef1c05f4686e48ebb11d52a3a7cb65c01b42015af68b29f53c2b21bf2c","category":"Apple"}
