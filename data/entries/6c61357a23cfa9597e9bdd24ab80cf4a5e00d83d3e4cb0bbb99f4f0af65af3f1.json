Both were last updated <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/review-surface-pro-9-makes-some-things-better-without-screwing-most-things-up/\">nearly a year and a half ago</a>, and they're both getting new Intel chips with significantly faster integrated GPUs, upgraded webcams, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/ai-comes-for-your-pcs-keyboard-as-microsoft-adds-dedicated-copilot-key/\">the Copilot key</a>, and better battery life (according to Microsoft's spec sheets).</p>\n\n<p>The catch is that both of these Surfaces are being sold exclusively to businesses and commercial customers; as of this writing, regular people will not be able to buy one directly from Microsoft, and they won't show up in most retail stores.</p>\n<p>These aren't the first Surface products released exclusively for businesses. Microsoft introduced a new business-exclusive Surface Go 3 tablet last fall, and <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2021/01/11/introducing-surface-pro-7-for-business-purpose-built-to-empower-people-teams-and-classrooms-in-the-new-digital-age/\">a Surface Pro 7+ variant</a> for businesses in early 2021. It is, however, the first time Microsoft has introduced new versions of its flagship tablet and laptop without also making them available to consumers. You can find some of these business-only PCs <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=Microsoft%20Surface%20Go%20For%20Business\">for sale at some third-party retailers</a>, but usually with extended shipping times and higher prices than consumer systems.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011458#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011458&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6c61357a23cfa9597e9bdd24ab80cf4a5e00d83d3e4cb0bbb99f4f0af65af3f1","category":"Tech"}
