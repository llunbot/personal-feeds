The company believes this system, called <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/adobe-launches-new-symbol-to-tag-ai-generated-content-but-will-anyone-use-it/\">Content Credentials</a>, will help photojournalists protect their work and prove authenticity in a world riddled with AI-manipulated content.</p>\n<p>Leica's M11-P can store each captured image with Content Credentials, which is based on the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity's (<a href=\"https://c2pa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">C2PA's</a>) open standard and is being pushed by the Content Authenticity InitiativeÂ (<a href=\"https://contentauthenticity.org/\">CAI</a>). Content Credentials, announced in October, includes encrypted metadata detailing where and when the photo was taken and with what camera and model. It also keeps track of edits and tools used for edits.</p>\n<p>When a photographer opts to use the feature, they'll see a Content Credentials logo in the camera's display, and images will be signed through the use of an algorithm.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979140#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979140&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b1a5c4c544a9762b1d44e75daee17ee4b25542c122b541f78fe868490351d16","category":"Tech"}
