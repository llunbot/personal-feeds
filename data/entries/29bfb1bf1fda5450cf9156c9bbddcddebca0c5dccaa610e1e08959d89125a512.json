In his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-09/apple-vision-pro-xr-headset-will-take-years-to-become-key-part-of-business-ljvfzfvr\">latest <em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>, Gurman said these iMacs are still in early development, so he does not expect them to launch until late 2024 or at some point in 2025 at the earliest.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg\" alt width=\"1626\" height=\"914\" />\r<br />\nGurman previously said Apple was developing a larger iMac <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/imac-with-over-30-inch-display/\">with over a 30-inch display</a>, and he has now specified that the display will be around the same 32-inch size as Apple's high-end Pro Display XDR monitor. Released in December 2019, the Pro Display XDR has 6K resolution for Retina-quality content and starts at $4,999.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple discontinued the Intel-based 27-inch iMac and iMac Pro over the past few years, and has yet to launch a larger-screen iMac with an Apple silicon chip as a replacement. Instead, Apple offers the 27-inch Studio Display, which can be connected to the Mac Studio or another Mac with Apple silicon, but this is not an all-in-one solution like the iMac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor now, the 24-inch iMac is the only all-in-one computer sold by Apple. The current model with the M1 chip was released in April 2021, and Gurman expects an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/19/when-to-expect-the-next-imac-to-launch/\">updated model with a faster M3 chip</a> to launch by early next year. All current Apple silicon chips are manufactured based on TSMC's 5nm process, while the M3 chip is expected to move to a 3nm process for significant performance and power efficiency improvements.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/09/apple-experimenting-with-32-inch-imac/\">Larger iMac With Around 32-Inch Display Reportedly in Early Testing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/larger-imac-with-around-32-inch-display-reportedly-in-early-testing.2395435/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"29bfb1bf1fda5450cf9156c9bbddcddebca0c5dccaa610e1e08959d89125a512","category":"Apple"}
