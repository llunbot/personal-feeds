The latest evidence comes courtesy of a patent filing from none other than Meta, which was apparently very inspired by one of Vision Pro’s most unique features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a patent filing <a href=\"https://www.patentlyapple.com/2024/07/monkey-see-monkey-do-meta-files-patent-designed-to-mimic-apple-vision-pros-eyesight-feature.html\">spotted by Patently Apple</a>, Meta has developed a feature described as “Embedded Sensors in Immersive Reality Headset to enable Social Presence” for the next Quest headset. If you think that sounds a lot like Vision Pro’s Eyesight feature, you’d be right. And if you think Meta is suddenly shifting gears to design its Quest Pro headset to look a lot more like Vision Pro, you’d also be right. Just take a look at the description of the feature:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The present disclosure is related to virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) headsets configured with multiple facial sensors to enable social presence in immersive reality applications. More specifically, the present disclosure is associated with embedded sensors in VR/AR headsets to provide information and incorporate, in real time, a facial expression of a user to a subject avatar for an immersive reality application.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If that’s not EyeSight, we don’t know what is. It’s a curious feature for Meta to copy—especially in such a way that it needs a patent. EyeSight is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2229980/apple-vision-pro-eyesight-feature-size-brightness-display.html\">Vision Pro’s most divisive feature</a>, with people sharing images of wonky visuals but Apple using it as a centerpiece of Vision Pro’s marketing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also possible that this patent refers only to taking measurements of eyes and facial expression for use <em>in VR</em>. In other words, not showing it on the outside of the device but rather making your virtual avatar mimic your real-life facial expressions. In that case, this patent comes closer to copying Apple’s work on Personas than EyeSight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re not entirely sure how such a patent would be allowed when EyeSight exists, but Meta does add that the signal could be “from an electrical sensor, from a capacitive sensor, from a contact microphone, from an optical sensor, from a haptic sensor, from a moisture sensor, and from a temperature sensor.” That’s probably different enough for the patent police, but we have to assume Apple isn’t thrilled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe it is. Vision Pro is still in its early stages of development and if it’s influencing one of its biggest competitors in such a high-profile way, perhaps Apple is on the right track.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3e6841e267809a03948a49f6fed6e0b4b0292da89ae86210ea988997df3c067e","category":"Apple"}
