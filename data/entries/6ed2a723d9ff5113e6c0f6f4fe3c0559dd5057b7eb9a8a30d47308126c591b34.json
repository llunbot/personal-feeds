To fast charge your Apple Watch Series 7, use the Apple USB-C Magnetic Fast Charging Cable.</blockquote>Apple may have an updated version of the ‌MagSafe‌ Duo that supports Apple Watch fast charging coming in the future, but ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ owners who already own the current version will need to settle for standard charging speeds.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-accessories/\">MagSafe Accessories</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/15/magsafe-duo-apple-watch-series-7-no-fast-charge/\">Apple's $129 MagSafe Duo Charger Can't Fast Charge Apple Watch Series 7</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-129-magsafe-duo-charger-cant-fast-charge-apple-watch-series-7.2317127/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oSoc4QBcl8w:CJJ4SS3rZuo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oSoc4QBcl8w:CJJ4SS3rZuo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oSoc4QBcl8w\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6ed2a723d9ff5113e6c0f6f4fe3c0559dd5057b7eb9a8a30d47308126c591b34","category":"Apple"}
