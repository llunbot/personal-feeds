There are two rectangular charging platforms, each with a pair of magnetic charging surfaces for charging four total devices at one time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/zens-quattro-charger.jpg\" width=\"1511\" height=\"850\" />\r<br />\nThe Quattro is a Qi2 charger, so each of the magnetic charging pucks can charge an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> at up to 15W. With Qi2 support and the multi-level design, the Quattro is able to charge four iPhones at once at 15W.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBecause the charger is flat, it works with both MagSafe-compatible iPhones and older Qi devices that do not have included magnets. The charging surface can also be used for AirPods and other smartphones, but it does not work with the Apple Watch. Given the orientation of the charger, it is worth noting that StandBy is not supported.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Quattro Charger Pro 4 can be <a href=\"https://zens.tech/shop/quattro-charger-pro-4/\">pre-ordered from the Zens website</a> for $200, with black and white color options available. It will ship out to customers at the end of October.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/03/zens-quattro-charger-pro-4/\">Zens Launches Qi2 Multi-Device Quattro Charger Pro 4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/zens-launches-qi2-multi-device-quattro-charger-pro-4.2435015/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f1e1984be1da1638f7f6d310760eb2953b07d6a6cbc28a736deb10c6aa7be650","category":"Apple"}
