But in most industrialized countries, the construction of nuclear plants tends to grossly exceed their budgeted cost and run years over schedule.</p>\n<p>One hope for changing that has been the use of small, modular nuclear reactors, which can be built in a centralized production facility and then shipped to the site of their installation. But on Wednesday, the company and utility planning to build the first small, modular nuclear plant in the US announced it was canceling the project.</p>\n<h2>Going small</h2>\n<p>Small modular reactors take several steps to potentially cut costs. Their smaller size makes it easier for passive cooling systems to take over in the case of power losses (some designs simply keep their reactors in a pond). It also allows the primary components to be built at a central facility and then shipped to different plant sites, allowing a lot of the manufacturing equipment to be reused for all the sites that use the reactors.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982466#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982466&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fb991483a31490a9688d8e924ac51d926f2236173fe6324541f318163a90cf00","category":"Tech"}
