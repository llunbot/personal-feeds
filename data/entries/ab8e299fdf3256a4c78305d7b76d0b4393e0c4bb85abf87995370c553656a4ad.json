For chrissake they pass Onion articles, which are intended as parody, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/23/goofy-ai-overviews\">as fact</a>. Russian misinformation is written with the intent of convincing the gullible that it’s legit; and LLMs are by nature gullible.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/18/ai-chatbots-russian-misinformation\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ab8e299fdf3256a4c78305d7b76d0b4393e0c4bb85abf87995370c553656a4ad","category":"Tech"}
