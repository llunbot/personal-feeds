Apple eventually mitigated the problem <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/\">with an iOS 17 update</a>, but it might go a step further with the iPhone 16 models that are set to be released later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature-White.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-moves-forward-with-foldable-iphone\"><em>The Information</em> today</a> cited a source who said that iPhone 16 models will be equipped with a \"larger graphite sheet\" inside the chassis of the devices, to address potential overheating. This corroborates a rumor from last November that claimed iPhone 16 models would feature an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-16-new-thermal-design/\">improved thermal management system</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to release the iPhone 16 series in September, so the devices should be just a few months away from launching. With this rumored change, the post-launch overheating issue should be a thing of the past.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/\">The Information</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/internal-change-to-iphone-16-models-expected-to-reduce-overheating/\">Internal Change to iPhone 16 Models Expected to Reduce Overheating</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/internal-change-to-iphone-16-models-expected-to-reduce-overheating.2432085/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0f6ee2144db9a343585f94dc1682da4fe9198914112a3a2c5b1bd3a89a4b274c","category":"Apple"}
