Industry groups also filed a <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1053179708951/1\">petition</a> with the FCC on Friday asking for a stay of the rules, claiming the regulations shouldn't take effect while litigation is pending because the industry is likely to prevail in court.</p>\n<p>The FCC is highly likely to reject the petition for a stay, but the groups can then ask appeals court judges to impose an injunction that would prevent enforcement. The industry lost a similar case during the Obama era, but is hoping to win this time because of the Supreme Court's evolving approach on whether federal agencies can decide \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/is-net-neutrality-doomed-at-supreme-court-fcc-and-isps-prepare-for-epic-battle/\">major questions</a>\" without explicit instructions from Congress.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028836#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028836&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fa559520a7b1e6bbe4ac2cff78d0659ca049e6a83d5a85fafad626b4d226aa7d","category":"Tech"}
