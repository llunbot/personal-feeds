Ever since we passed the watershed opening to the transfer market on 1st August, actual moves started to be officially revealed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It meant teams and riders could finally put us out of our misery and share the news of who’s going where for 2025, though the rumours will keep on circling until all rosters are filled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the men, Simon Yates, Julian Alaphilippe and Ben O’Connor have made some of the biggest moves in the transfer market this year. There are also plenty of rumours brewing around riders cutting ties early, notably Tom Pidcock. On the women’s side, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\" target=\"_blank\">2023 Tour de France Femmes</a> champion Demi Vollering is expected to move away from SD Worx-Protime, Visma-Lease a Bike have signed MTB World and Olympic champ Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, and Elisa Longo Borghini has sealed her future with UAE Team ADQ.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Elisa Longo Borghini signs for UAE Team ADQ</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/longo-borghini-liege-1-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/longo-borghini-liege-1-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/longo-borghini-liege-1-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/longo-borghini-liege-1-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/longo-borghini-liege-1-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/longo-borghini-liege-1-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/longo-borghini-liege-1-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/longo-borghini-liege-1-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/longo-borghini-liege-1-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/longo-borghini-liege-1-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/longo-borghini-liege-1.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At long last, Giro d’Italia Women champion <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/elisa-longo-borghini-cyclist\">Elisa Longo Borghini</a> has confirmed her transfer from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a> to UAE Team ADQ. In a video announcement, the Italian revealed the news along with the confirmation that she will race for the team for the next three seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transfer has been long rumoured. In fact, it was widely known from as long ago as the Spring Classics. It comes after Lidl-Trek confirmed they would not be keeping the Italian on their books for another season. Longo Borghini joins Demi Vollering in a big switch-up at the top of women’s stage racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Italian will lead UAE Team ADQ in Grand Tours to come. Her pedigree in this domain and equally in the Classics will see her lift UAE Team ADQ’s stock in the women’s peloton. Longo Borghini will join Silvia Persico, Karlijn Swinkels and Lara Gillespie at the squad, who have also recruited Elynor Bäckstedt as well as Longo Borghini’s Lidl-Trek teammate Brodie Chapman.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/anna-van-der-breggen-comeback\">Anna van der Breggen to return to racing in 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/red-bull-bora-hansgrohe\">What does Red Bull’s takeover of Bora-Hansgrohe mean for cycling?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-sponsors\">Who actually are the Tour de France team sponsors 2024?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/il-lombardia-preview\">Il Lombardia 2024: Everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Kasper Asgreen on the move to EF</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-08T095613.605-970x647.png\" alt=\"kasper asgreen soudal quickstep\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-08T095613.605-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-08T095613.605-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-08T095613.605-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-08T095613.605-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-08T095613.605-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-08T095613.605-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-08T095613.605-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-08T095613.605-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-08T095613.605-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-08T095613.605.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Danish Classics star Kasper Asgreen has been long rumoured to be on the move. His relationship with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/soudal-quickstep\" target=\"_blank\">Soudal-Quickstep</a> soured after remarks made by Patrick Lefevere in the media at the beginning of the season. This hinted his departure from the team alongside Julian Alaphilippe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following initial reports from <em>Gazzetta dello Sport</em>, former Tour stage winner Kasper Asgreen has confirmed his move to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ef-education-easypost\" target=\"_blank\">EF Education-EasyPost</a>. This comes after earlier rumours faded of a potential move to Norwegian squad Uno X Mobility and upcoming Swiss team Tudor Pro Cycling. Asgreen is EF’s first big transfer of the window.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The main reason for me to come to this team is the way that the guys race,’ Asgreen said. ‘You can see that there’s always a plan to try to win. Even if the race is not perfectly suited to them, the guys won’t just sit in the bunch, waiting for the other teams to take charge.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At EF, Asgreen will fill the slot of Alberto Bettiol who moved to Astana in mid-August. The former Tour of Flanders winner will anchor the cobbled Classics team and provide some chances in Grand Tour breakaways.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Movistar win the race for Pablo Castrillo</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/CAuldPhoto-2024-LaVuelta-Stage15-3745-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"pablo castrillo vuelta a espana\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/CAuldPhoto-2024-LaVuelta-Stage15-3745-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/CAuldPhoto-2024-LaVuelta-Stage15-3745-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/CAuldPhoto-2024-LaVuelta-Stage15-3745-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/CAuldPhoto-2024-LaVuelta-Stage15-3745-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/CAuldPhoto-2024-LaVuelta-Stage15-3745-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/CAuldPhoto-2024-LaVuelta-Stage15-3745-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/CAuldPhoto-2024-LaVuelta-Stage15-3745-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/CAuldPhoto-2024-LaVuelta-Stage15-3745-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/CAuldPhoto-2024-LaVuelta-Stage15-3745-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/CAuldPhoto-2024-LaVuelta-Stage15-3745-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Chris Auld</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pablo Castrillo was the breakout star of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta last month</a>. The Spaniard shocked many by taking two well-earned stage wins, in particular <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/winners-losers-vuelta-week-two-2024\" target=\"_blank\">his queen stage win up to Cuitu Negru</a>, which proved that he was a real talent after dropping Sasha Vlasov and Pavel Sivakov on the steep slopes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Vuelta, Ineos Grenadiers appeared to be in pole position to sign Castrillo. Rumours to that effect were already circling before the race, and only seemed to be gaining momentum as the Spanish Grand Tour progressed.

On the back of his success with UAE Team Gen Z, Spanish rider Pablo Torres has secured a contract with the WorldTour UAE squad until the end of the 2030 season, making this one of the longest contracts in the current peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being a handful of years younger than his opposition, Torres claimed two stages of the 2024 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-l-avenir-success\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de l’Avenir, the under-23 equivalent to the Tour de France</a>. There, he impressed on the final stage to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/colle-delle-finestre-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Colle delle Finestre</a> where he put minutes into his opposition and even defeated Chris Froome’s climbing record set during his game-changing Stage 19 win at the 2018 Giro d’Italia. In the aftermath of that ride, some touted this as the greatest teenage performance in cycling history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of his Tour de l’Avenir stage victories, the 18-year-old from Madrid finished in second place overall at both the Tour de l’Avenir and the Giro Next Gen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Torres’s big UAE deal comes off the back of a wave of long-term contracts for young riders negotiated by the team. The list includes Juan Ayuso, another former teenage star, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a>, 2018 Tour de l’Avenir champion, and Isaac del Toro, the 2023 Tour de l’Avenir winner, on similarly long contracts. However, no rider in the WorldTour apart from Wout van Aert has a contract until 2030 at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Decathlon-AG2R fill their line-up for 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T145631.855-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T145631.855-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T145631.855-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T145631.855-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T145631.855-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T145631.855-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T145631.855-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T145631.855-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T145631.855-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T145631.855-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-17T145631.855.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the end of the season approaching, some teams have already closed their doors for 2025.

Bissegger, a time-trialist by trade, is a former European champion against the clock, and a strong <em>rouleur </em>in his own right. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Norwegian talent Johannes Staune-Mittet has announced a surprise move away from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Visma-Lease a Bike</a> where he has been contracted for a number of years now. The Scandinavian is a former winner of the Giro Next Gen and the under-23 Tour de France, the Tour de l’Avenir. Staune-Mittet moved onto the WorldTour this year, but missed any Grand Tour starts in 2024. Australian Callum Scotson and Norwegian Tord Gudmestad will also ride in the galaxy-inspired Decathlon jersey next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of Decathlon-AG2R’s staff, Luke Rowe has been announced as a <em>directeur sportif </em>for 2025. After 14 years spent with Ineos Grenadiers as a rider, the Welshman will start his retirement from within the Decathlon-AG2R team car.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Movistar sweep up young talents Diego Pescador and Natnael Tesfatsion</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"635\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2163414526-min-970x635.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2163414526-min-970x635.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2163414526-min-300x196.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2163414526-min-768x503.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2163414526-min-1536x1006.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2163414526-min-2048x1341.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2163414526-min-750x491.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2163414526-min-1140x746.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption> Luc Claessen/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In their recently-found transfer flow, Movistar have announced the arrival of two promising talents: Natnael Tesfatsion and Diego Pescador.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Natnael Tesfatsion is another product of Eritrea’s growing crop of cycling talents. He has been contracted to Lidl-Trek for the past two years and caught attention at the beginning of 2024 with podium finishes at the WorldTour level Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race and the criterium-style Down Under Classic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesfatsion is considered to be a <em>puncheur </em>with a solid sprint. This was demonstrated in his two overall victories at the Tour du Rwanda as a rider for Androni. During this time, he starred in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a> on several occasions. Now aged 25, he will swap Lidl-Trek colours for those of Movistar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other signing, Colombian Diego Pescador finished inside the top ten at the Tour de l’Avenir in August. At the age of 19, Pescador was one of the youngest riders at the forefront of that race, which is often closely watched by talent scouts. Following in the footsteps of compatriot Nairo Quintana, Pescador will move to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/movistar\" target=\"_blank\">Movistar </a>for 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Elise Chabbey joins Juliette Labous at FDJ-Suez</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T120923.937-970x647.png\" alt=\"elise chabbey\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T120923.937-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T120923.937-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T120923.937-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T120923.937-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T120923.937-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T120923.937-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T120923.937-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T120923.937-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T120923.937-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T120923.937.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Elise Chabbey has confirmed her departure from Canyon-SRAM.

She has finished on the final podium at the Vuelta and Tour de Suisse, and has had top five results at Paris-Roubaix, Liège-Bastogne-Liège and Dwaars Door Vlaanderen. Chabbey will, therefore, play a Swiss Army Knife role in the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>French champion Juliette Labous has already signed a three-year contract with FDJ-Suez, seeing her through until her 29th birthday. Labous and Chabbey will join Demi Vollering at FDJ-Suez if we are to believe the rumours. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/evita-muzic-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Évita Muzic</a> will still provide another key card for FDJ-Suez next year.

In a unique deal struck up between himself and Visma-Lease a Bike, Van Aert has signed a ‘lifetime contract’ with the Dutch team. This means that he will ride with the team indefinitely, presumably until the end of his career. This squashes any doubts surrounding his future with the team. It was previously rumoured that he was linked to Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe following Red Bull’s takeover of the team and considering Van Aert’s personal sponsorship deal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Belgian has been with the team since 2019. In that time, he’s taken nine Tour stages, a Monument victory, a Tour green jersey, as well as supporting Jonas Vingegaard’s two Tour titles. It goes without saying that he is a key figure within this setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This is unique in our sport, but we both didn’t have to think long about that,’ said team boss Richard Plugge. ‘Wout has become an important culture carrier, an indispensable link in our team. He is a leader and a team player,’ Plugge continues. ‘We are extremely happy with him and that is mutual.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Lidl-Trek sweep up some big names</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T124925.643-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T124925.643-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T124925.643-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T124925.643-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T124925.643-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T124925.643-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T124925.643-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T124925.643-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T124925.643-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T124925.643-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-09-19T124925.643.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek </a>have been very active in the women’s transfer window.

The former Latvian champion is a strong <em>rouleur </em>and valiant teammate. Also moving from the WorldTour to Q36.5 is Sjoerd Bax of UAE Team Emirates.

Rutsch will leave EF-Education-EasyPost after five seasons spent with the team that has seen Rutsch feature in two Tours de France and plenty of WorldTour breakaways. At his new Belgian home Intermarché-Wanty, Rutsch will play a crucial role in Biniam Girmay’s lead-out train and Classics ambitions. On the other hand, Rune Herregodts will leave Intermarché for UAE Team Emirates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been long-awaited for Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe to announce the signings of Oier Lazkano and Jan Tratnik.

Currently sitting deep in the UCI relegation zone, Alexander Vinokourov’s team is in need of some change in order to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\" target=\"_blank\">solidify their WorldTour status</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first man to jump ships was Italian champion Alberto Bettiol who announced a mid-season transfer in mid-August. Along with Bettiol, fellow Tuscan Diego Ulissi was announced to be joining the team soon after. The eight-time <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a> stage winner will anchor Astana’s one-day squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the mountains, Astana confirmed the signing of Sergio Higuita following intense rumours. The Colombian will ride for Astana until the end of 2026. Higuita backs up the other climbing signing of Wout Poels. The Dutchman, a former Monument winner and Tour stage victor, will bring optimism for the squad in Grand Tour breakaways for their critical 2025 season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reigning Commonwealth and Kiwi champion Aaron Gate has also confirmed his move to Astana for 2025. The 33-year-old New Zealander will make his WorldTour debut with the team after years spent on the lower tiers of pro cycling. This isn’t to take away from his reputation, Gate is a well-known track rider who has claimed two world titles, an Olympic medal and a waft of medals at the Commonwealth Games. Gate has sealed this move on the back of an impressive summer in East Asia. He claimed two stages and the overall title at the Tour of Hainan as well as the general classification at the Trans-Himalaya Race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also rumours Mark Cavendish will continue racing in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Julian Alaphilippe and Marc Hirshi sign for Tudor Pro Cycling</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"julian alaphilippe marc hirschi tudor pro cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-18-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Rafa Gomez - Pool/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of speculation, Alaphilippe has finally settled on his new home for 2025. This will end a turbulent decade with Soudal-QuickStep, earmarked recently by discordant comments from team boss Patrick Lefevere. After confirming his departure from QuickStep at the beginning of August, the Frenchman has signed a contract with Swiss team Tudor Pro Cycling through to 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I liked the Tudor Pro Cycling project from the beginning,’ Alaphilippe explains. ‘I saw the team arrive and develop, and I also know a few of the riders and staff members. What better way to mark a turning point in my career than with a new and ambitious project?’ The Swiss team headed by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/fabian-cancellara-on-life-in-retirement-i-m-busier-now-than-when-i-raced\" target=\"_blank\">Fabian Cancellara</a> has been growing in the past few seasons, courtesy of some big-name transfers such as Alberto Dainese, Arvid de Kleijn, Michael Storer and Matteo Trentin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with Alpahilippe, Marc Hirschi has also confirmed his transfer to Tudor Pro Cycling. This transfer brings to an end Hirschi’s four-year-long partnership with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a>.

Since then, Hirschi has scored some solid one-day victories, but he only made two Grand Tour appearances during his four seasons at the team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with Hirschi and Alaphilippe, Tudor Pro Cycling have brought in Swiss Fabian Lienhard and Austrian Marco Haller.

Much like his brother Adam at UAE, Simon will be hoping to star in a powerful mountain train at future Tours de France. The 2018 Vuelta winner has penned a contract for the next two seasons, putting an end to his ten years spent at Jayco-AlUla.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike director Grischa Niermann said that Yates would provide ‘a significant boost for the general classification squad. Simon will have the opportunity to go for his own results with us, but he will also be a valuable asset for the team in the mountains’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Yates gone, Jayco-AlUla have announced that they will bring in Perth-born Ben O’Connor. High in confidence from finishing runner-up at the Vuelta, O’Connor will lead Jayco-AlUla’s Tour de France hopes for at least the next two seasons. Despite his Australian nationality, O’Connor has never ridden for<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jayco-alula\" target=\"_blank\"> the GreenEdge project</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with O’Connor, Paul Double, Koen Bouwman and Patrick Gamper will join the squad.

Two trusted transfer gurus Ciro Scognamiglio and Daniel Benson have reported on this potential move. According to Benson, ‘talks ongoing at this stage’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Q36.5 don’t deny their involvement in this rumour. The squad, which is run by former Team Dimension Data boss Doug Ryder, has signed a handful of WorldTour riders in the past two years, including former European champion Giacomo Nizzolo, former Latvian champion Emīls Liepiņš and UAE Team Emirates rider Sjoerd Bax who will join the team next year. Pidcock, however, would be the team’s biggest transfer if this rumour were to become a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This speculation has been supported by a report from<em> Global Peloton</em>, which shared that Ryder has confirmed that the team will undergo a ‘restructuring’ phase. This, in part, involves the closure of the team’s development programme. Some suggest that Pidcock could be at the forefront of this restructuring, with the aim of reaching more WorldTour races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The British rider, and double <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Olympic </a>champion, has been the subject of much transfer speculation this year. A couple of months ago, a rift was reported between Pidcock and Ineos Grenadiers. It was previously mentioned that he is actively looking to break his contract with the team early. Lidl-Trek and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/red-bull-bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe</a> were among the names previously linked to the Amstel Gold Race winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some suspicion of this deal is rooted in Pinarello’s ties to Q36.5 investor Ivan Glasenberg, who is reported to be the new owner of the Italian bike firm. Pidcock currently rides a Pinarello at Ineos and has been the face of the brand’s marketing in the UK in particular. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumour: Gianni Moscon to Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-09T121829.805-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-09T121829.805-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-09T121829.805-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-09T121829.805-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-09T121829.805-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-09T121829.805-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-09T121829.805-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-09T121829.805-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-09T121829.805-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-09T121829.805-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-10-09T121829.805.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to reports from<em> Gazzetta dello Sport</em> in the Italian press, Gianni Moscon won’t receive a contract extension from Soudal-QuickStep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After cutting his teeth at Ineos Grenadiers, Moscon moved away to pursue other roles at Astana Qazaqstan and then Soudal-QuickStep. The Italian supported team leader Remco Evenepoel earlier this year at the Tour de France and he also played his part in helping Mark Cavendish’s return to top-level sprinting in his previous role at Astana Qazaqstan in 2023. During his time away fro Ineos, Moscon also developed a blood issue that caused chronic fatigue and a lack of consistent form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After his one-year stint at the Belgian squad, Moscon is heavily rumoured to be joining Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe at the end of the season. At the German team, Moscon would continue his supporting role for the squad GC leaders and sprinters. He will also slot into Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe’s growing Classics roster, which has been significantly bolstered during this transfer window courtesy of Oier Lazkano, Laurence Pithie and the Van Dijke twins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ralf Denk’s team currently has enough space in their 2025 roster. Moscon is also one of the few Swiss Army knife-style riders available on the market. Plus, at the age of just 30, he’s one of the youngest options left on the table for 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumour: No more talk over Remco Evenepoel, he’ll stay at Soudal-QuickStep</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0089-min-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0089-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0089-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0089-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0089-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0089-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0089-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0089-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0089-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0089-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/Worlds-Cyclist-Sunday-Race-29092024-0089-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> has been the subject of a string of transfer rumours over the past twelve months. Ineos Grenadiers, Israel-Premier Tech and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe have all been linked to the Belgian in what would be a big-figure mid-contract poach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, Red Bull-Bora-Hangrohe had the strongest lead on Evenepoel’s future contract. The German team were rumoured to be inching towards signing the double Olympic champion this summer, with talks emerging at the Tour de France according to some transfer specialists. Apparently, a deadline was set for Evenepoel to make his decision, but no news emerged from the Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, these rumours can now finally be put to bed. Evenepoel has stated that he has no intention of leaving Soudal-Quicktep, the team he has ridden for since the age of 18. Last month, the Belgian made it clear that no contract would be broken anytime soon, saying that he ‘didn’t know anything’ about a possible move to Ralf Denk’s energy drink-powered team. For now, we expect speculation to deescalate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rumour: Demi Vollering expecting to go to FDJ-Suez</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-1686208389-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"tour de romandie feminin demi vollering\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-1686208389-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-1686208389-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-1686208389-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-1686208389-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-1686208389-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-1686208389-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-1686208389-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-1686208389-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-1686208389-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-1686208389-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In March, news broke that Demi Vollering will be leaving SD Worx-Protime at the end of 2024. After a partnership that has resulted in Classics victories and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2023\" target=\"_blank\">a Tour de France Femmes</a> title, the Dutch champion will seemingly go elsewhere for 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it’s perhaps not a surprise given the increasing powers of Lotte Kopecky and the return of Anna van der Breggen next season, Vollering is the biggest name in the women’s market this year and there is a fierce and exclusive battle for her signature. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumours were that Vollering’s agent was in serious talks with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a> up until the Tour of Flanders when the American team pulled back their interest in support of their current roster’s future objectives. FDJ-Suez remains the strongest contender. SD Worx-ProTime directeur sportif Lars Boom has already confirmed his transfer across to FDJ-Suez and we expect that Vollering will make the same announcement soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other men’s rumours and confirmations</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2165888628-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Rafal Majka is presenting with his team before the 81st Tour de Pologne in Wroclaw, Poland, on August 11, 2024.

At this point in the season, many of the key moves have already been confirmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mick van Dijke and his brother Tim van Dijke have signed for Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe. The Dutch twins will bolster the ever-growing Classics ambitions of the German team. Laurence Pithie and Finn Fisher-Black bring two Kiwis into the emerging superteam. Likewise, Israel-Premier Tech have hardened their line-up with the signings of Alexey Lutsenko, Jan Hirt and Mathias Louvel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Simon Carr, Emanuel Buchmann and Alex Aranburu have signed for Cofidis and the strong duo of Jonathan Narváez and Florian Vermeersch have signed contracts for 2025 with UAE Team Emirates. Andreas Kron, a stage winner on last year’s Vuelta, has signed for Uno-X Mobility. Dries van Gestel has also filled another spot at Soudal-QuickStep having declared his departure from TotalEnergies. Victor Campanaerts’ move to Visma-Lease a Bike was finally revealed while the Belgian was at the Vuelta. This has been long expected, with rumours of the move starting in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soudal-QuickStep have also announced the signing of Max Schachmann, Ethan Hayter and Pascal Eenkhoorn. Schachmann, a two-time winner of Paris-Nice, will return to the team he started his pro career. For Eenkhoorn, this will mark the end of a short stint at Lotto-Dstny, and Hayter will carry the British national champion’s jersey to the Belgian team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some riders still on the market include Grand Tour stage winners Rafał Majka and Esteban Chaves. Rumours also circulating surrounding Caleb Ewan, who was reported to be jumping ship to Astana Qazaqstan. There hasn’t been any news on this front for the past couple of months however.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other women’s rumours</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2157668615-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the women, Lotte Kopecky and Lorena Wiebes have penned hefty contract extensions until 2028.

Chiara Consonni, already a stage winner at the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-women-route-live-coverage-prize-money-teams\" target=\"_blank\"> Giro d’Italia Women</a>, is also linked to Canyon-SRAM. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Austrian Katrin Schweinberger has revealed her new home for 2025. She will leave Ceratizit in favour of the American team Human Powered Health along with Lotto-Dstny’s Thalita de Jong. Ingvild Gåskjenn, a breakout star from the spring Classics, has penned a contract with Uno-X Mobility. Former world champion Amelie Dideriksen, however, is on her way out of Uno-X. She will move to Cofidis in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Curious where the money for these big contracts comes from?
