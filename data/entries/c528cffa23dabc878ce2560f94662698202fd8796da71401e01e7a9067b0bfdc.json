I couldn't be more stoked with the results; the world's fastest race lube, which shows that being green can be fast.</p>\n<p>'Developed with our pro teams at our in-house R&amp;D facility and supported by independent testing means we have ticked the box of hardcore tab and real-world testing as part of our chain optimisation and lube development programmes.'</p>\n<p>It didn't come cheap either, apparently requiring a seven-figure investment that went towards investing on state of the art machinery for its tribology department including a white light infterferometer, which helps them to accurately measure wear, and a dynamometer, which is used to replicated chain movement in race conditions.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9816/muc-off-ludicrous-af-images#5\"><p><span>Image 6 of</span> 6</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/06/mucoff_ludicrous_af_1.jpg?itok=A3XLwQDJ\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 6 of </span>6</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<h3>Fast and Furious</h3>\n<p>How can a lube claim to be fast? Well, obviously it can't, but Muc-Off says it leads to 18% less power consumption than its nearest competitor.</p>\n<p>This is because when applied, molecules in the lube's formula, once it's sat deep within the chain links and the chain is moving, react with the surface of the chain, which creates a sheer plane that helps to reduce friction, in turn maximising power efficiency.</p>\n<p><a

repeatability tests and it's been examined against Absoluteblack, Ceramicspeed and Silca equivalents.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9816/muc-off-ludicrous-af-images#4\"><p><span>Image 5

possible in all conditions and temperatures.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a

looks to build on its Project Green initiative to improve the sustainability of its business.</p>\n<h3>We go front, back and side to side</h3>\n<p>For a 50ml bottle of Muc-Off Ludicrous AF, you'll
