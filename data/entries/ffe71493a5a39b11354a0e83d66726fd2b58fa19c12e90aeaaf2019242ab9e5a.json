[credit:\n                              Motorola                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>Motorola is launching the <a href=\"https://motorolanews.com/experience-next-level-entertainment-with-the-new-moto-g-power-5g-and-moto-g-5g/\">2024 version</a> of its \"Moto G\" budget phone. Today we've got two versions, the \"Moto G 5G 2024\" and the \"Moto G Power 5G 2024\" to pick from. The base Moto G 2024 is $199.99, while the Power version is $299.99.</p>\n<p>The specs on the base model Moto G are all over the place. We've got a low-resolution, high refresh rate 6.6-inch, 120 Hz, 1612Ã—720 LCD and a Snapdragon 4 Gen 1. The phone has a whopping 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 5000 mAh battery with 18 W wired charging. You get a lot of extras: a 3.5 mm headphone jack, NFC (!), a side fingerprint reader, and a microSD slot. The Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 is about as cheap of a chip as you can get from Qualcomm, a 6 nm chip with two Cortex A78 CPUs and six A55 CPUs. It seems criminal that these budget Qualcomm chips prioritize barely there 5G bands yet only support <a>802.11ac, AKA \"Wi-Fi 5,\"</a> which first hit smartphones <a href=\"https://meraki.cisco.com/blog/2013/02/htc-one-first-mainstream-802-11ac-phone/\">in 2013.</a></p>\n<p>On the back of the base-model Moto G is one real camera, a 50MP rear sensor, and a just-for-looks 2MP \"macro\" sensor. The front camera is 8MP.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009597#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2009597&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ffe71493a5a39b11354a0e83d66726fd2b58fa19c12e90aeaaf2019242ab9e5a","category":"Tech"}
