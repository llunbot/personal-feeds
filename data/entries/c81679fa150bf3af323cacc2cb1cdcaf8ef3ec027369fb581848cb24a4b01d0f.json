Whether you need to learn about AWS, plan your project, setup new services, migrate existing applications, or optimize your spend, <span>AWS IQ</span> connects you with experts and consulting firms who can help. You can share your project objectives with a description, receive responses within the <span>AWS IQ</span> application, approve permissions and budget, and will be charged directly through AWS billing.</p> \n<p>Until yesterday, experts had to reside in the United States to offer their hands-on help on <span>AWS IQ</span>. Today, I’m happy to announce that AWS Certified experts and consulting firms based in the UK and France can participate in AWS IQ.</p> \n<p>If you are an AWS customer based in the UK or France and need to connect with local AWS experts, now you can reach out to a wider pool of experts and consulting firms during European business hours. When creating a new project, you can now indicate a preferred expert location.</p> \n<p>As an AWS Certified expert you can now view the buyer’s preferred expert location to ensure the right fit. <span>AWS IQ</span> simplifies finding relevant opportunities and it helps you access a customer’s AWS environment securely. It also takes care of billing so more time is spent on solving customer problems, instead of administrative tasks. Your payments will be disbursed by AWS Marketplace in USD towards a US bank account. If you don’t already have a US bank account, you may be able to obtain one through third-party services such as <a href=\"https://wssellers.hyperwallet.com\">Hyperwallet</a>.</p> \n<p><strong><span><span>AWS IQ</span> User Interface Update</span></strong><br /> When you create a new project request, you can select a <strong>Preferred expert or firm location</strong>: Anywhere, France, UK, or US.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/09/15/aws-iq-preferred-location-1-1024x307.png\" /></p> \n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-iq-get-help-from-aws-certified-third-party-experts-on-demand/\">Jeff Barr’s launch article</a> to learn more about the full request creation process.</p> \n<p>You can also work on the same project with multiple experts from different locations.</p> \n<p>When browsing experts and firms, you will find their location under the company name and reviews.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/09/15/aws-iq-expert-profile.jpg\" /></p> \n<p><span><strong>Available Today</strong></span><br /> <span>AWS IQ</span> is available for customers anywhere in the world (except China) for all sorts of project work, delivered by AWS experts in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.
