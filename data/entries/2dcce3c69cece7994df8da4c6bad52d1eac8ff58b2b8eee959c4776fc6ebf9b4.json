The three new countries have been added in an updated version of Apple's ‌AppleCare‌+ <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210580\">support document</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn all eligible countries, if you paid upfront for an ‌AppleCare‌+ plan for ‌iPhone‌, ‌iPad‌, or Apple Watch, you may be eligible to purchase new coverage that renews monthly.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple says that new coverage must be purchased within 30 days of when the original coverage ends, and customers can find out if they're eligible for extended coverage by going to <a href=\"https://mysupport.apple.com/\">mysupport.apple.com</a> and following the on-screen instructions. The new coverage plan will automatically renew until it is canceled.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nExcept in places where local law requires it, Apple will not provide notifications that an ‌AppleCare‌+ plan is about to expire, so customers must check themselves.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has a separate renewal plan for customers in mainland China, who can pay annually for continued ‌AppleCare‌+ coverage once their original plans expire.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌AppleCare‌+ provides device coverage beyond the initial warranty period, plus it covers two incidents of accidental damage every 12 months, with customers paying a small deductible for repairs or replacements.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Update 7:10 p.m.</b>: Based on Apple's support document, this article originally indicated that annual renewals of ‌AppleCare‌+ for Mac were now available in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Apple has, however, updated its support document again to note that Mac renewals remain exclusive to the U.S., and this article has been revised accordingly.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/17/renewable-applecare-plus-coverage-for-mac-expands/\">Renewable AppleCare+ Coverage Now Available in France, Italy, and Spain [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/renewable-applecare-coverage-now-available-in-france-italy-and-spain-updated.2311556/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7XOTwOgH7S0:RX0m1aofEBw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7XOTwOgH7S0:RX0m1aofEBw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/7XOTwOgH7S0\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2dcce3c69cece7994df8da4c6bad52d1eac8ff58b2b8eee959c4776fc6ebf9b4","category":"Apple"}
