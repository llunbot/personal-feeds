Entering the contest is as simple as contributing a Pack to the <a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-pack-community-registry\">Nomad Pack Community Registry</a>. Each month, the Nomad team will review the Packs contributed and vote on the winners. The first place prize is a HashiCorp backpack and additional winners (up to 5) selected each month will receive a Nomad t-shirt!</p>\n<p>The Nomad team will be picking winners based on a combination of the Pack’s production-readiness, how commonly used its applications are, how well it demonstrates Nomad features, and its general usefulness. In addition to the monthly winners, the first community-contributed pack accepted will get a backpack!</p>\n<p>To get started writing packs, visit the <a href=\"https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/nomad-pack-writing-packs?in=nomad/nomad-pack\">Writing Custom Packs Learn Guide</a>.
