Before you part with your money you should check that the model you are buying isn’t about to be upgraded by Apple. There is nothing worse than buying a new MacBook Air only to see Apple update the models a month later. Luckily you are here reading this article so the chance of you making a mistake like that is slim (although you should check the date this article was last updated!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we’ll tell you the best time to buy a MacBook, when to buy a Mac, at what time of year Apple usually updates its Macs, and whether an update is expected soon. We’ll also mention if there are any particular configurations to avoid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will run through each Mac and MacBook Apple currently sells and assess whether now is a good time to buy one based on educated guesses as to when the next one will launch. Sometimes if you wait a month or two you can get more for your money – provided Apple keeps its prices the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you make the decision of which Mac to buy you should also check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/219909/best-mac.html\">Mac buying guide</a> and our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/669997/best-macbook-apple-laptop.html\">MacBook buying guide</a>. We also offer advice about how much storage, RAM and cores in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2308505/how-much-macbook-gpu-cpu-ram-ssd.html\">How much MacBook RAM, SSD, GPU and CPU do you really need?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are reading this around Black Friday, read our advice in our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373543/best-macbook-black-friday-deals-november-2023.html\">best Black Friday MacBook deals</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373696/mac-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">best Mac mini and iMac deals</a>.

One is to be aware of when Apple last updated the range. The other is to note when Apple has previously announced updates to that range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple updated the MacBook Pro, Mac mini and iMac at an event in October 2024. We don’t anticipate any more Mac updates until spring 2025. take a look at our article about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">Apple Events</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products.html\">new products expected from Apple</a> to check that the outlook hasn’t changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recent/current launches:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max</strong> – October 2024</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>24-inch iMac, M4</strong> – October 2024</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mac mini, M4 and M4 Pro</strong> – October 2024</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>15-inch MacBook Air, M3</strong> – March 2024 (RAM update in October 2024)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mac Studio, M2 Max and M2 Ultra</strong> – June 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mac Pro, M2 Ultra</strong> – June 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>13-inch MacBook Air, M2</strong> – July 2022 (RAM update in October 2024)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the times when a Mac launch is most likely. In the past, the most likely times to see Mac updates were: WWDC in June for professional Mac models (e.g. Mac Studio and Mac Pro) and October for consumer-focused Macs (e.g. MacBook Air and Mac mini). However, as you will see when you read on, this is not a rule that Apple abides by particularly, nor does Apple always launch new Macs at special events: it often just takes the Apple Store offline for a few hours and then when it returns new Mac models are available as it did in October 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It used to be easier to predict when Apple would launch new Macs because updates were often tied to the launch of the next generation of Intel processors. Now that Apple has transitioned from Intel to its own series of processors, it is no longer tied to Intel’s upgrade cycle. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the updates happen more frequently though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do, however, think that updates for the following Macs are likely to arrive in the next few months. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>13- &amp; 15-inch MacBook Air, M4</strong>: Now that the MacBook Pro has an M4 chip we expect that the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air will get an update soon. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">MacBook Air rumors</a>. Expected launch: Spring 2025.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mac Studio, M4</strong>: The Mac Studio go the M2 Max and M2 Ultra in June 2023. We expect that the whole of 2024 will pass without an update so expect an M4-Max/Ultra in 2025, perhaps at WWDC. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">M4 Mac Studio.</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mac Pro, M4</strong>: Like the Mac Studio, we expect a update in June 2024.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iMac Pro</strong>: Apple discontinued the larger-screened 27-inch iMac when the Mac Studio was introduced, but there are rumors that it could make a comeback. Read about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">new iMac Pro.</a> Expected launch: 2025.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should I wait for Black Friday deals?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are thinking of buying a new Mac and the last few months of the year are approaching, you should hold on to take advantage of deals season. From October onwards is when we tend to see the most deals, with everyone saving their best discounts for the weeks around Black Friday at the end of November. If you are wondering whether to wait until Black Friday itself or take advantage of an early deal that’s marked as being ‘early Black Friday’ or similar, our advice is to just go for it! In the past lots of retailers have started their Black Fridays sales a long time before the day itself and promised that prices won’t go any lower on Black Friday itself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s unlikely that Apple will offer any discounts for Black Friday though. The company tends to offer vouchers with qualifying sales around Black Friday, and we don’t expect that to change: here’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672787/apple-black-friday.html\">what Apple is likely to be doing for Black Friday</a>. So don’t expect Apple to offer discounts on Black Friday, but you might be able to get money off Apple products from another reseller. We see many resellers offering Black Friday deals on Apple products, so come back around Black Friday and check out our best </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we don’t only see prices cut for Black Friday, we see deals on Apple products all year round – so don’t assume you can’t get money off a new Apple product when you need to buy one.

There are two 13-inch models: one with an M2 chip that launched in July 2022 and one with an M3 chip that went on sale in March 2024. There is also a 15-inch MacBook Air with M3 that was updated in March 2024, which we discuss below.</p>\n\n<p>The M2 MacBook Air, with its brand-new design, arrived in the summer of 2022. It gained a MagSafe charging port, meaning that two USB-C ports are available. In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\">13-inch M2 MacBook Air review</a> we described it as “just right for nearly every user” thanks to its improved display with thinner bezels, full-size function row, killer battery life and outstanding performance in its class. There are still some areas that let it down though, for example, the fact that you can’t plug in more than one other monitor, unless you close the MacBook lid or follow this workaround: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675869/how-to-connect-two-or-more-external-displays-to-apple-silicon-m1-macs.html\">How to connect two or more external displays to Apple Silicon Macs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When the M3 version of the MacBook Air arrived in spring 2024 we were impressed, finding that the M3 chip gave a nice performance boost. In October 2024, with the arrival of the M4 in the MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air does look a little less impressive, but Apple increased the unified memory (RAM) in the M3 and M2 MacBook Air, from 8GB to 16GB, paving the way for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a>.  </p>\n\n<h3>Is now a good time to buy a 13-inch MacBook Air?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>No</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The M2 MacBook Air is an excellent machine and it is the cheapest Mac laptop right now. However, the 13-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip only costs $100/£100 more, so our advice would be to pay a little extra for better specs. In October 2024 the M3 MacBook Air had a RAM boost, which is certainly a point in favor of buying one right now, but, with the MacBook Pro gaining an M4 chip at the same time, it’s likely that the MacBook Air will get a similar update soon. </p>\n\n<p>Our recommendation is that if you find a good discount on the price of the M3 MacBook Air check that the model being sold includes the now standard 16GB RAM, rather than 8GB RAM. If you find a 16GB equipped M3 MacBook Air at a good price then it will be a good buy, as long as you are prepared for disappointment in early 2025 when the MacBook Air is upgraded.

In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\">review of the 15-inch MacBook Air</a> we said that the 15-inch MacBook Air is “exactly like the 13-inch MacBook Air only with a bigger display (and thus chassis) and better speakers”. But if you prefer larger laptops then the 15-inch MacBook Air will save you thousands compared to the 16-inch MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n<p>It offers better battery life than the smaller model and offers a larger screen, and while it costs a bit more than the 13-inch model, it is much less than the other Mac laptops with larger screens. The 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,599/£1,599, while the 15-inch MacBook Air starts at $1,299/£1,399.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is now a good time to buy a 15-inch MacBook Air?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apple launched the 15-inch MacBook Air in March 2024, but while it’s still less than a year old, we do expect that Apple will update it in early 2025 with the M4 chip that arrived in the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac mini in October 2024.</p>\n\n<p>One point in favor of the 15-inch MacBook Air is that Apple doubled the unified memory (RAM) in October 2024, so there is at least 16GB RAM as standard in the 15-inch MacBook Air, which should mean that if you find a good deal on a 16GB RAM-equipped model you won’t regret spending your money. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShould I buy a 14-inch MacBook Pro now or wait?\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"3840\" height=\"2743\" alt=\"Should I buy a 14-inch MacBook Pro now or wait?\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,599 | $1,799 | $1,999\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859562-REG/apple_mw2w3ll_a_14_macbook_pro_m4.html/BI/21318/KBID/22251/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1648573/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$1399 at  B&amp;H</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHWM5FB?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$1,474 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-14-inch-MacBook-Pro-M4-chip-with-10C-CPU-10C-GPU-512GB-SSD-16GB-Memory-Space-Black-MW2U3LL-A-Fall24/13699524771\" target=\"_blank\">$1484 at  Walmart Electronics</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Last update</strong>: October 2024</li>\n\n<li><strong>Next update</strong>: October 2025</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apple upgraded the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max in October 2024. We don’t expect to see another update until at least the fall of 2025. </p>\n\n<p>When we reviewed the MacBook Pro M4 model we found it offered a good performance boost over the MacBook Pro M3. The boost from 8GB to 16GB unified memory is one benefit, another gain comes in the form of an extra Thunderbolt/USB 4 port. In our review we described the M4 MacBook Pro as: “a package bursting with value. It no longer feels like a compromised laptop, and you get a lot of performance and features for the price”. </p>\n\n<p>If you are a pro user who needs a little more oomph then the M4 Pro or M4 Max models offer more ports (including Thunderbolt 5) and superior power. In our review of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2511696/16-inch-macbook-pro-m4-pro-review.html\">M4 Pro</a> models we said they “have what it takes to conquer your processing demands”.

So or recommendation right now is to buy the MacBook Pro if you see a good deal. If you find a deal on the older M3 MacBook Pro we would advise against it because that model has less RAM. </p>\n\n<p>If it’s the M4 Pro or M4 Max edition you are after, our recommendation is buy one, you won’t be disappointed.

The iMac is less expensive than the MacBook Pro, starting at $1,299/£1,299 compared to $1,599/£1,599 for the MacBook Pro, but the MacBook Pro is better equipped, with a 10-core GPU, rather than the 8-core GPU found in that entry-level iMac. There’s also double the storage in the MacBook (512GB compared to 256GB).

The Mac mini with M4 or M4 Pro is the long awaited successor to the M2 Mac mini and M2 Pro version. </p>\n\n<p>The Mac mini is now even smaller, but it’s just as powerful as any other M4 equipped Mac. The performance and value on offer for just $599/£599 is excellent, if you are trying to spec up a machine to meet higher demands we found that can be expensive, but that is the case with all of Apple’s build-to-order options. </p>\n\n<p>The pro version of the Mac mini does much to fill the gap left by the removal of the 27-inch iMac, as long as you have a decent monitor you can use. </p>\n\n<h3>Is now a good time to buy a Mac mini?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We recommend the M4 Mac mini. It offers the same specs as the other M4 Macs for much less money, the only difference being the absence of a screen. But since you can buy a decent 4K display for less than £300/$300 we don’t think that is a big problem. See our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668700/best-mac-monitors-displays.html\">best monitors for Mac</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The M4 Pro Mac mini is a great option for anyone who needs affordable power. The only reason to hold off buying is if you want to wait for Apple to update the Mac Studio with M2 Max and M2 Ultra. However, the Mac Studio starts at $1,999/£2,099, while the M2 Pro Mac mini offers much better value at $1,299/£1,299. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to buy a Mac mini now check out our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673695/best-mac-mini-deals-of-april-2022.html\">Best Mac mini deals</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShould I buy a Mac Studio now or wait?\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"Should I buy a Mac Studio now or wait?\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Mac-Studio.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t£1,999\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1770944-REG/apple_mqh73ll_a_mac_studio_with_m2.html/BI/21318/KBID/22251/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1239878/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$1799 at  B&amp;H</a><a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/321564/1175784/1036?prodsku=ACMQH73&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmqh73.html&amp;intsrc=CATF_9102\" target=\"_blank\">$1889 at  Adorama</a><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Mac-Studio-MQH73LL-A-Desktop-Computer-Apple-M2-Max-Dodeca-core-12-Core-32-GB-RAM-512-GB-SSD-Silver/3421381899\" target=\"_blank\">$1949 at  Walmart Electronics</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Last update</strong>: June 2023<br /><strong>Next update</strong>: 2025</p>\n\n<p>The Mac Studio arrived in March 2022 and we were impressed by its processing power, port flexibility and price. In our review we said “The Mac Studio offers exciting processing prowess,” and added: “It may even be a suitable replacement for an Intel Mac Pro in certain situations.” That model was replaced by a Mac Studio with M2 Max or M2 Ultra back in June 2023, but there hasn’t been an update in 2024.</p>\n\n<p>In our review of the model that arrived in June 2023, we said that: “The Mac Studio is the ideal Mac–it’s powerful, priced appropriately, has lots of ports for connecting devices, and it won’t take up a lot of desk space,” and described it as a “complete package of processing power, features, and design”. An HDMI upgrade fixes one of our biggest problems with the original Mac Studio, bringing 8K display support and support for more displays overall. </p>\n\n<h2>Is now a good time to buy a Mac Studio?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>No</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nearly a year and a half after the Mac Studio with M2 Max and M2 Ultra arrived in June 2023, the M4 Max has arrived in the MacBook Pro. That chip which will eventually be destined for the Mac Studio, along with the M4 Ultra (unless Apple jumps straight to the M5). </p>\n\n<p>With an update log overdue it certainly looks likely that the Mac Studio will see an update in 2025. We expect Apple to update the model either at, or before, WWDC in June. If you need a powerful machine in the meantime then you are better off considering the M4 Pro Mac mini or M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pro. </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, take advantage of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678533/mac-studio-deals.html\">Best Mac Studio deals</a>, because we do see some big discounts on these models. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1948425/mac-studio-m2-max-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple Mac Studio (M2 Max, 2023) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShould I buy a Mac Pro now or wait?\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"4032\" height=\"2268\" alt=\"Should I buy a Mac Pro now or wait?\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3692130/apple_mac-pro-display-pro_mac-pro_060319.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $6,999\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-pro\" target=\"_blank\">$6999 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Last update</strong>: June 2023</li>\n\n<li><strong>Next update</strong>: 2025</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apple launched the current Mac Pro in June 2023, three and a half years after the range was last updated in December 2019. That was the first update since December 2013 (which was a wait of six years!)</p>\n\n<p>The main benefit of the 2019 Mac Pro design is shared by the design of the 2023 Mac Pro: it offers PCIe expansion slots (seven in total) and its modular design should mean that there is the potential for SSD upgrades down the line (although RAM won’t be upgradable and nor will the GPU or CPU).  </p>\n\n<p>The Mac Pro has a lot of competition in the form of the Mac Studio, which offers the exact same spec as the Mac Studio and is cheaper. The Mac Pro brings an extra fan, more ports and there is a rack-mounted option. </p>\n\n<h3>Is now a good time to buy a Mac Pro?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>No</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The disadvantage is that Apple hasn’t updated the Mac Pro (or Mac Studio) since mid 2023. While Apple often waits a long time between Mac Pro updates, the M4 Pro has more than caught up with the M2 Max and the M4 Max has edged ahead of the M2 Ultra, so if you need the power then the Mac Pro isn’t looking as attractive next to its siblings </p>\n\n<p>When the Mac Pro is finally updated we expect it to leap ahead, so our recommendation it to wait. We expect an update at, or before, WWDC.  </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a935a15e3abe0121d0f451ce5cfd184ecc10a231f344c258f932e861da4e7057","category":"Apple"}
