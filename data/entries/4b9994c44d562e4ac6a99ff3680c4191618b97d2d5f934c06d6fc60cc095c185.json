It also has a \"fully flat display,\" ending years of Android's weird curved OLED panel gimmick that only served to distort the sides of the display. Samsung says the new Ultra design has \"42 percent slimmer bezels\" and a front hole-punch camera cutout that is \"11 percent smaller\" than those on the S23 Ultra. The rest of the design looks like Ultra models of past years, with rounded edges and a flat top and bottom. The bottom still houses an S-Pen for handwriting and drawing.</p>\n<p>All that titanium will cost you. The S24 Ultra is $100 more than last year, coming to an eye-popping $1,300. An iPhone 15 Pro Max is $1,200, and a Pixel 8 Pro is $1,000, so that's a tough sell.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994407#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994407&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b9994c44d562e4ac6a99ff3680c4191618b97d2d5f934c06d6fc60cc095c185","category":"Tech"}
