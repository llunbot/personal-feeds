{"title":"Terraform AWS Provider Continues to Expand Coverage","link":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-aws-provider-continues-to-expand-coverage","date":1638205200000,"content":"<p>In the past year, we’ve significantly increased HashiCorp Terraform’s coverage of the Amazon Web Services service ecosystem. In the Terraform AWS provider alone we’ve merged more than 1,800 pull requests for new features, enhancements, bug fixes, and more.</p>\n<p>These coverage improvements fall into four main categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Contributions from the community</li>\n<li>Contributions from AWS</li>\n<li>New service additions and significant enhancements</li>\n<li>New products</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><a href=\"#contributions-from-the-community\">»</a><a></a>Contributions From the Community</h2>\n<p>This year we continued our investment in external service maintainers and community pull requests. In the last year we’ve merged more than 900 community pull requests ranging from documentation improvements to new service additions. Our community has been essential  to continuing to build extensive support for AWS services such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/pm/sagemaker/\">Amazon SageMaker </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/\">Amazon FSx</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/chime/\">Amazon Chime</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/\">Amazon Quicksight</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"#contributions-from-aws\">»</a><a></a>Contributions From AWS</h2>\n<p>In addition to our community, our partners at AWS have made important contributions to our service footprint and launch-day support capabilities. Along with new service support for Amazon Connect and expanded support for EventBridge, AWS contributions allowed HashiCorp to offer launch-day or fast-follow support for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon DocumentDB Global Clusters</li>\n<li>AWS Lambda functions powered by Graviton 2</li>\n<li>VPC flow logs in Parquet format</li>\n<li>Athena pay-per-request enablement</li>\n<li>GP3 support for launch configurations</li>\n<li>Warm Pools for Auto Scaling groups</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"#new-service-additions-and-significant-enhancements\">»</a><a></a>New Service Additions and Significant Enhancements</h2>\n<p>Throughout the year, the engineering team at HashiCorp responsible for the AWS provider works not only to enable community contributions but also to increase the coverage and lower the burden of maintenance of the provider. In the past year we’ve added coverage for a number of popular AWS services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon Cloudwatch Synthetics</li>\n<li>Managed workflows for Apache Airflow</li>\n<li>Amazon Timestream</li>\n<li>AWS Amplify</li>\n<li>AWS AppConfig</li>\n<li>Amazon AppStream</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to adding services, the maintainers work to expand the footprint of existing services. The team has made enhancements to our coverage of such services as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon S3 Replication Time Control</li>\n<li>AWS KMS Multi-Region Keys</li>\n<li>Amazon Elasticsearch native SAML for Kibana</li>\n<li>Amazon EC2 launch templates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, this list covers only a fraction of the new features, enhancements, and bug fixes that have made their way into the AWS provider in the last year.

This provider is dynamically generated from a unified resource schema, which allows us to bring you new resources faster. We released the AWS Cloud Control provider for Terraform as a tech preview on September 30, 2021.</p>\n<p>For more information on AWS Cloud Control API, please visit the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/what-is-cloudcontrolapi.html\">AWS User Guide</a>.

We’ve added over 175 resources, bringing the total to over 830 resources. Along with the 400+ resources in the AWSCC provider, you can now provision more than 1,000 AWS resource types with Terraform. We look forward to further expanding our AWS service offerings through our continued investment in both our community contributors and partners at AWS.</p>\n<p>We would love to hear your feedback.
