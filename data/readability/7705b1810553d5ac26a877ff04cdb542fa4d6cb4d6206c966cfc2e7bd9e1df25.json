{"title":"Canyon launches affordable Grizl AL – the same gravel bike now in metal","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/canyon-launches-affordable-grizl-al-the-same-gravel-bike-now-in-metal/","date":1634806809000,"content":"<div><div><p>It was a few months back that Canyon launched its adventure-focused gravel bike, the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/canyon-grizl-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Grizl</a>. Offering a robust carbon frame, slightly more progressive geometry, and many a mounting point, the Grizl was created to fit in a fast-growing category of bikepacker-style and off-road-centric gravel bikes. </p><p>Now the consumer-direct bicycle company has announced a more affordable version of the Grizl, one that is effectively a <s>carbon</s> aluminium copy. </p><p>Like the carbon version, the new Grizl AL features room for up to 700 x 50 mm rubber and comes stock with 700 x 45 mm treads. The exception to this is the three smallest sizes (including a new XXXS size) which are all designed around smaller 650B wheels. The Grizl AL shares the same geometry as the carbon version which is centred around a long frame reach and short stem. For all those details and more be sure to check out James Huang’s detailed review of the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/canyon-grizl-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Grizl CF</a>. </p><p>The Grizl AL is ready to take all sorts of bags and accessories, including fenders. The new aluminium version also adds the ability to attach a rear pannier rack, something that no other Canyon drop-bar can claim. And of course, it’s quite a bit cheaper than the carbon version. </p><p>Canyon is starting off with just two models. The cheapest is the US$1,899 / AU$2,599 / €1,499 Grizl 6 which features a rigid carbon fork (with mounting points), Shimano GRX 400 2×10 shifting, DT Swiss Gravel LN wheels (alloy rims), and Canyon’s own compliant seatpost. Spending US$2,499 / AU$3,099 / €1,999 gets you the Grizl 7 Suspension with a new 30 mm travel <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/rockshox-goes-gravel-with-rudy-xplr-suspension-fork-and-reverb-xplr-dropper/\" target=\"_blank\">RockShox Rudy XPLR suspension fork</a>, and a mixed Shimano GRX 2×11 600/810 groupset. </p><p>On paper, these seem like stellar value. So, like with most of Canyon’s more affordable bike releases, I suspect it won’t be long before backorder timelines balloon out. </p><p>You can find more information at <a href=\"http://canyon.com/\">canyon.com</a>. </p></div></div>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"7705b1810553d5ac26a877ff04cdb542fa4d6cb4d6206c966cfc2e7bd9e1df25","category":"Cycling"}
