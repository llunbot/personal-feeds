The same is true for the rest of us at <em>MacRumors</em> - our iPhones appear to be functioning as intended and running cool following the initial setup and syncing period.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the switch to titanium, Apple lowered the weight of the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models, plus added contoured edges that are much more comfortable to hold. Dan says that this is one of the most notable changes for him, and it makes picking up an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> downright uncomfortable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBattery life has been solid, but the Action Button is a work in progress and it can take some time to figure out what's most useful. We'll have a dedicated Action Button video coming sometime in the near future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the camera, it's unsurprisingly pretty great. 24-megapixel photos make a difference, and the 5x Telephoto lens is an improvement over the prior 3x version. We're also planning an in-depth camera comparison, so stay tuned for that.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMake sure to watch Dan's full video, and if you have one of the new ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models, let us know what you think in the comments below.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/72-hours-using-the-iphone-15-pro-max/\">Video Review: 72 Hours Using the iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/video-review-72-hours-using-the-iphone-15-pro-max.2405272/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4ee09a28abbad71cbe5997237b0018f67383bdb6deb219f2dab2eae6202175b7","category":"Apple"}
