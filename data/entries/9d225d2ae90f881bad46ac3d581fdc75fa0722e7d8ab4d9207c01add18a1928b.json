{"title":"iOS 18.3.1 released to fix ‘extremely sophisticated’ security flaw","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2604159/ios-18-3-1-released-to-fix-extremely-sophisticated-security-flaw.html","date":1739219026000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple just issued a small update to iOS and iPadOS, bringing the version up to 18.3.1. The only change appears to be <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/122174\">this security fix for USB Restricted Mode</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>USB Restricted Mode is that feature where you have to enter your iPhone or iPad passcode when you connect it to a computer or other USB device with a data connection, saying you “trust” that device. Without your passcode, the USB device only delivers power. Apple says the fix addresses a physical attack vector against this feature:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“A physical attack may disable USB Restricted Mode on a locked device. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds like some very specific people were targeted with this security flaw, and Apple has rushed to issue a fix for this very important security measure. Fix or no fix, you should never plug your iPhone into a USB device that you don’t know and trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple released <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2558637/ios-18-3-release-date-beta-features-and-compatibility.html\">iOS 18.3</a> on January 27 but has yet to begin development of iOS 18.4, which is expected to bring several new Apple Intelligence features, including the new Siri. Apple will reportedly release the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/new-iphone-se-release-date-se4-16e-design-specs-features.html\">iPhone SE 4</a> this week, which could arrive as early as Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To update your iPhone or iPad, head over to the Settings app, then the <em>General</em> tab and <em>Software Update</em>, and tap <em>Update Now</em>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9d225d2ae90f881bad46ac3d581fdc75fa0722e7d8ab4d9207c01add18a1928b","category":"Apple"}
