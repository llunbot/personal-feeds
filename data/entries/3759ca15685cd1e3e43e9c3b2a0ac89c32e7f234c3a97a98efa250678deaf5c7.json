{"title":"We promise this 2022 iPad Air deal is better than the 2024 model","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2270452/this-ipad-air-deal-is-already-better-than-the-new-model-coming-next-week.html","date":1711127305000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a near certainty that Apple is planning to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2269510/new-ipad-pro-air-launching-march-26-rumor.html\">launch a new iPad Air</a> within the next week or so, but unless you want a larger screen, there’s not much of a reason to upgrade, especially when you can get the current model for this cheap. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09V3K2RS4/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is knocking $150 off all colors and configurations of the iPad Air</a>, bringing <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09V3JH3XS?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">the 64GB model down to an incredible $449</a>, the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad Air is a near-perfect tablet with a 10-.9-inch Liquid Retina display, speedy M1 chip, a 12MP front camera with Center Stage, Apple Pencil support, USB-C, and Touch ID. The new model isn’t expected to change much about what we love about it, but it is expected to bring a faster chip, better cameras, and a new 12.9-inch option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a larger screen, then wait. But if you just want a fantastic tablet that will be fast, capable, and beautiful for years to come, go grab one before the new model arrives and they’re gone forever.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3759ca15685cd1e3e43e9c3b2a0ac89c32e7f234c3a97a98efa250678deaf5c7","category":"Apple"}
