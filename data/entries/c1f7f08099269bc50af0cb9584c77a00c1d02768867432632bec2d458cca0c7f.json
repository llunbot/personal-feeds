{"title":"Apple Sports, Updated for Football Season, Will Soon Support Live Activities","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/08/apple-sports-is-ready-for-football-season/","date":1725401858000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With iOS 18 and watchOS 11, the Apple Sports app will offer Live\nActivities for all teams and leagues available in the app for the\nfirst time ever, delivering live scores and play-by-play at a\nquick glance to a user’s iPhone and Apple Watch Lock Screens.</p>\n\n<p>Coming in an app update later this year, Apple Sports will also\nintroduce a new drop-down navigation for the main scorecard views,\nmaking it even faster to switch between My Leagues, My Teams, and\nusers’ feeds for favorited leagues. A new enhanced search makes it\neasier to view matches for leagues fans do not currently follow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does anyone understand why it requires <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/31/live-activities-ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> for Live Activities? Perhaps it’s just a subtle nudge to get people to upgrade their device OS?</p>\n\n<p>Also: Interesting but unsurprising to me that Apple Sports will support Live Activities on WatchOS, but won’t offer a WatchOS app. I think this is the way most — or at least many — apps should support WatchOS going forward. It’s just never been a great platform for “apps”. It’s a great platform for glanceable information, though. </p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/03/apple-sports-football-live-activities\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c1f7f08099269bc50af0cb9584c77a00c1d02768867432632bec2d458cca0c7f","category":"Tech"}
