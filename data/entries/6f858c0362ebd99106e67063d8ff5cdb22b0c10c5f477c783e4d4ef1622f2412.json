Chief among these is a more generous revenue split for publishers on the platform. Starting in October, Google will only take a 15 percent cut of the first $3 million in revenue for each new game on Stadia.</p>\n<p>Assuming the industry-standard 30 percent cut, that means publishers stand to make up to $450,000 more per game before Google's cut reverts back to the standard at the $3 million threshold (a Google representative told Ars that \"<span>Stadia</span>Â currently provides competitive revenue share terms with partners that matches what they typically see from other industry platforms\"). The more generous deal only applies to \"newly signed games\" on Stadia from October through the end of 2023, though, meaning publishers that got in on Stadia early will miss out on the increase for their legacy titles.</p>\n<p>Google will also more directly be giving publishers a cut of the proceeds from the games <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/google-stadias-latest-free-game-only-has-a-few-thousand-total-players/\">Stadia offers as freebies</a> through its $10/month Stadia Pro subscription. A full 70 percent of Stadia Pro revenue will now be shared with the publishers of \"any new title that enters into Stadia Pro\" starting this month. That revenue will be divided up among publishers based on the number of \"session days\" (i.e., daily active users per day) logged on each title among all Stadia Pro users.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779785#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779785&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6f858c0362ebd99106e67063d8ff5cdb22b0c10c5f477c783e4d4ef1622f2412","category":"Tech"}
