There are rather a lot of towns like Comeglians in the Carnic Alps, little more than footnotes to the provincial highways yet still somehow containing everything one could need: a restaurant, a supermarket, a post office, a bank, an ironmongers, a hotel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we ride I check them off in that order.

As a general rule, trying to build higher up the peaks is like balancing a marble on a seesaw, with the emphasis on the <i>saw</i>, so towns cling to the feet of the jagged limestone cliffs in a way that means most roads out must go up. It’s how Marco has been able to plan a ride that will total just 65km but yet aggregates some 2,800m of ascent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, he does need a little bit of help to achieve such stats, which is why he has drafted in a notorious friend. The name’s Zoncolan, Monte Zoncolan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Like father, like son</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Monte Zoncolan Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-02-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-02-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-02-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The early slopes of the Monte Crostis climb, which begins in earnest from the village of Comeglians</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In his early twenties, Marco looks like he was born on a bike, so too his father. Yet the duo, who run the portentously named Pendenze Periclose cycle tours (translate: ‘dangerous incline’), came to cycling late in their lives, the younger a ‘smoker, drinker, I liked to party’; the older an ‘overweight security guard at the Vatican’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emiliano, Marco’s father, made a permanent move here to Arta Terme in northeast Italy, while Marco splits his time between here and his native Rome. Both are excellent adverts for what cycling can do for you, no matter when you take it up. In four years Emiliano has gone from 90kg and 40 cigarettes a day to having made over 100 ascents of the Zoncolan. <i>One hundred</i>. That’s 14 Everests.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Monte Zoncolan Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-03-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-03-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-03-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In this Emiliano is something of a local legend. The town even threw him a party for his 100th summit, and while Marco’s tally is somewhat less significant, he still knows the climb like the back of a cereal box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence the best word to describe how he talks about the Zoncolan is ‘friend’, a kind of lovable rogue that sits in the Giro d’Italia’s oeuvre like the Angliru does in the Vuelta’s – a savage climb that regularly steals the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>M</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet today we won’t be attacking the Zoncolan in the classic style, from Ovaro in the west. Nor shall we do it in ‘reverse’, as the professionals will do on Stage 14 at this year’s Giro, running in from Sutrio to the east. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, Marco has a third way up his sleeve, and it worries me that it doesn’t appear on any maps. However, for now the Zoncolan is a featureless enemy, too far in the future to see.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Monte Zoncolan Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We ride through a cobbled tunnel, the sign to our left striking a red line through the word ‘Comeglians’. Just tens of metres later it becomes apparent we’re making our first down-payments on our altitude debt. The vanishing point of the road has moved up in our vision by a few feet and Marco cheerily chimes in with, ‘See, Monte Crostis already.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where have you been?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I never cease to be surprised by the climbs in northern Italy. Just when I think I’ve heard of them all, another one sticks its hand up in the crowd and I wonder how on earth I overlooked it until that point. Today that climb is Monte Crostis, 15.5km long and just brushing the underside of 2,000m; average gradient 9%, multiple stretches near 20%.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Monte Zoncolan Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-05-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-05-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-05-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>If you see this playground you’re about to start climbing the old road up the Zoncolan</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The initial slopes are steep enough to silence us both and it’s this ceremonial hush that soundtracks the film unspooling in front of me. The road is the kind of grey a wet school jumper goes, with the lack of central markings indicating how narrow it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To one side are brilliant green conifers dripping in the morning damp, on the other dozens of stacked logs, bark peeling like chocolate flake from their drying yellow centres. In 2018 the Carnic Alps were ravaged by severe storms, which blew whole mountainsides bald and reduced trees to matchsticks, and nearly two years on loggers are still clearing the fallout.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Monte Zoncolan Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-06-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-06-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-06-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The ramps of the Monte Zoncolan old road are a series of 16% stings, and there’s still two-thirds of the climb to go until the top</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Two cyclists pass us as we happen upon Tualis, the Crostis’s last meaningful town. They nod with the solemnity of those who know that they’re coming down while you’re going up. Their rushed wind disturbs our quiet air and for a moment a welcome breeze crosses the road. But it is short-lived.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mid-July temperatures, though far from record-bothering, are enough to bother me, but slowly I can feel the air temperature drop in a way that indicates we are gaining serious height. Still, I can’t see any references in the landscape to our loftier position. Were it not for the road this would be dense forest, and as such trees obscure all but the faintest vertical slithers of view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switchbacks start in earnest, the first pairs a quick turn one way followed by a more languid sweep the other, flourishes of a signature written into the pine trees. But like a constrictor they slowly tighten to the kinds of corners that look down upon each other, until finally we emerge into a near-straight that propels us into our first big landscape.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-07-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Monte Zoncolan Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-07-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-07-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-07-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>A view of the Panoramica delle Vette road that forms the high point of the Monte Crostis pass</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Peaks of purple layer the horizon, while ahead is what looks like sky but what Marco ruefully tells me is mist. It has enveloped the Panoramica delle Vette road that is to be our prize for reaching the Crostis’s top, a gravel pass so named for the sweeping views it offers. Marco says what any cyclist encountering distant mist always says: ‘Don’t worry, it’ll burn off.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Misty eyed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Concerns about visibility disappear more quickly than the land as we enter the last 2km. This was what Marco warned me about, the classic sting in the tale all the best climbs have, as if the road engineers had enough with building and decided they wanted the job finished fast so set about laying the shortest pathway to the top.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"842\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg 842w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-750x265.jpg 750w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Our previous 8-10% intensifies to long stretches of 18%.

We pass into the town limits of Sutrio and I see several signs pointing towards the Zoncolan. We pass each one with a wag of Marco’s finger.

This is the old road up the Zoncolan I was promised. And what a horrendous promise it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Had we made our start in Sutrio as the pros will come May, the first few kilometres’ gradient would roll along in single digits, and even when the road crossed to 10% at least there it would stay until the last brutal 3km.

I wonder when someone will invent a Garmin add-on to measure bodyweight during a ride.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-16-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Monte Zoncolan Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-16-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-16-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-16-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-16-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-16-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-16-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-16-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-16.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The top of the Zoncolan is absolutely the kind of climb that requires photographic evidence.

The ‘classic’ ascent averages 11.5% over 10.5km from Ovaro to the west, and is usually how the climb appears in the Giro d’Italia. However this year’s peloton will approach from Sutrio to the east, a longer 13.5km climb but less steep at 8.9%. Both still feature lengthy stretches in the high teens though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Big Ride ascent is the shortest of all – 8.9km from Priola – but it averages 12.8% with multiple spikes up to 22% from the off (the other two routes steepen as they go). But whichever way you approach the Zoncolan, know that it is tough with a capital T. And yet there is an even tougher climb just down the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few clicks west of Ovaro lies the Passo della Forcella, a 9.2km long climb with a 14.4% average, a kilometre at 20.9% and another 2km at 17.7%. Worse still it’s often strewn with leaves and much of the surface is slab concrete. Why not give it a go?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The rider’s ride</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>FiftyOne Disc, £12,000 (£6,000 frameset), <a href=\"https://fiftyonebikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fiftyonebikes.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-18-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Monte Zoncolan Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-18-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-18-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-18-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-18-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-18-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-18-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-18-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-18.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There’s something about a FiftyOne that always makes me think that, for the right customer, it will prove a brilliant investment. First, because it is fully bespoke it fits like the proverbial glove, but second, because it is round-tubed it won’t date, yet custom paint means it will be forever unique. It looks classily current now; it will look the same in 10 years’ time (and if you spread the cost over 10 years it will only set you back £3.29 a day). And then there’s the ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve ridden both rim and disc brake FiftyOnes, and both hit that precise sweet-spot of focussed handling paired with exceptional balance, specifically in terms of stiffness, where the frame reacts and flexes as it negotiates turns yet smashes powerfully out of corners, into sprints and up climbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Round tubes are just very good at promoting this sort of ride feel, but it also helps if you source the best round tubes from Enve and Deda and put them together in a meticulous fashion. I’ve been to see this Dublin builder’s work in progress and the craftsmanship is as good as it gets. It almost seems a shame to paint a FiftyOne. But then you do, and it looks like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-19-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Monte Zoncolan Big Ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-19-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-19-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-19-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-19-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-19-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-19-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-19-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/monte-zoncolan-big-ride-19.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Venice Marco Polo is the best airport for flying cheaply. From there it’s a two-hour drive to Arta Terme via the faster toll roads – expect to pay around €15 each way – but we’d recommend going cross-country for a more scenic passage. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grand Hotel Gortani is a classically Italian hotel in Arta Terme, with spacious rooms, spa, swimming pool and well-kept gardens. Double rooms start at around £70pn in June. See gortani.it for more details. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Big thanks to Marco Cantagallo, who planned our route and guided us enthusiastically, his father Emiliano for lending us Marco (he is usually a bike guide) and Mauricio, who drove our photographer and dished up an impromptu picnic. Emiliano and Marco run Pendenze Periclose bike tours (<a href=\"https://pendenzepericolose.it/\" target=\"_blank\">pendenzepericolose.it</a>). Thanks also to the Grand Hotel Gortani’s manager, Chiara, for being so accommodating of bicycles and early breakfasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 113 of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/monte-zoncolan-italy-cycling\">The secret road: Monte Zoncolan Big Ride</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d4573d7aa470ff2736ce60bd545672af749ef16054eb61d3b8563748146af4ab","category":"Cycling"}
