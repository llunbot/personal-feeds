You can make the window bigger or smaller, changing the amount of screen space that it takes up on the Mac desktop.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are only three total sizes, including actual size, which is the size of your ‌iPhone‌'s display, smaller, and larger.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe size options can be accessed by launching the ‌iPhone‌ Mirroring app, connecting to an ‌iPhone‌, and then choosing your size from the View menu. There is no option to drag the window to resize, and you have to use the View options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-mirroring/\">iPhone Mirroring is a feature</a> that is designed to allow you to control your ‌iPhone‌ from your Mac, interacting with apps and receiving notifications while your ‌iPhone‌ remains locked and tucked away.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/iphone-mirroring-change-window-size/\">You Can Change iPhone Mirroring Window Size in macOS Sequoia Beta 4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-change-iphone-mirroring-window-size-in-macos-sequoia-beta-4.2432067/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"49771201df447fdf685f2316faeb999f4c51a0f6673fd8af4e120d3ff245b086","category":"Apple"}
