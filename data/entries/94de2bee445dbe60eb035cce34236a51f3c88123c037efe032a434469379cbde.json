This and a couple of other machine learning-based features are coming this fall via a software update.</p>\n<p>Apple touted the upcoming Adaptive Audio update as a way to use AirPods Pro with fewer distractions. It uses machine learning so it can detect noises you want to block out, like cars honking, but not the ones you want to hear, like someone speaking to you.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944583#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944583&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"94de2bee445dbe60eb035cce34236a51f3c88123c037efe032a434469379cbde","category":"Tech"}
