Operating under the name of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/stinner-manufacturing-builds-bikes-for-you-in-the-usa/\" target=\"_blank\">Stinner Manufacturing</a>, they have quietly become one of the largest bicycle manufacturers in the USA. Their current client list includes Zink Bikes, Sklar Bikes, Old Man Mountain, and Rogue Fitness. Yes, the Ohio-based strength and conditioning equipment company. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In late 2024, the company announced their first bike, the Milo hardtail. Named after the Milo-Grogan neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio that is home to Rogue HQ and also the Rogue Bike Factory where the Milo is assembled. <a href=\"https://columbusunderground.com/rogue-fitness-planning-bike-factory-in-milo-grogan-bw1/\" target=\"_blank\">Future plans</a> apparently include an “old-school bike shop” where you’ll be able to test ride bikes in person. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-Milo-usa-made-commuter-bike-by-Stinner7.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

states that the Milo was designed by Aaron Stinner, owner and founder of Stinner Frameworks in Santa Barbara, California. It’s also manufactured by Stinner and built with a 4130 chromoly frame and fork. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-Milo-usa-made-commuter-bike-by-Stinner6.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1082\" height=\"588\"

some cardio and a warmup in before you lift, and the Milo seems to have been designed with that in mind. The Gates CDX single speed belt drive system will require little maintenance, and the hand-built Astral Outback 32h wheels are high quality, though it does seem like the 2.5″ tires would benefit from a wider rim. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-Milo-usa-made-commuter-bike-by-Stinner1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1081\" height=\"583\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-Milo-usa-made-commuter-bike-by-Stinner1.png\" alt=\"Rogue Milo Stinner made commuter bike hookworm tires\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-Milo-usa-made-commuter-bike-by-Stinner1.png 1081w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-Milo-usa-made-commuter-bike-by-Stinner1-297x160.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-Milo-usa-made-commuter-bike-by-Stinner1-120x65.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-Milo-usa-made-commuter-bike-by-Stinner1-768x414.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no denying that this is a relatively heavy bike at 30.6lbs for a single speed without suspension or a dropper post. But a big chunk of that weight can be attributed to the tire choice. Maxxis Hookworms are bomb-proof, which makes them perfect for an urban commuter that is marketed to people who spend a lot of time in the gym and may be heavier than the average cyclist. However, those 29 x 2.5″ Hookworms weigh 1185g each, making the tires alone 5.22lbs of the total bike weight. Swapping to something like the 905g Maxxis Grifter, still in a 29 x 2.5″, would drop over a pound from the tires alone. It’s still a heavier build, but the emphasis has definitely been placed on overall durability and ease of maintenance. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-milo-geometry.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1309\" height=\"581\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-milo-geometry.png\" alt=\"Rogue Milo Stinner made commuter bike geo chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-milo-geometry.png 1309w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-milo-geometry-297x132.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-milo-geometry-120x53.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-milo-geometry-768x341.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-Milo-sizing-chart.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1326\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-Milo-sizing-chart.png\" alt=\"Rogue Milo Stinner made commuter bike size chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-Milo-sizing-chart.png 1326w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-Milo-sizing-chart-297x94.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-Milo-sizing-chart-120x38.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogue-Milo-sizing-chart-768x243.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also now priced at just $495 (marked down from $995), which seems like a great price for a Stinner-made commuter with quality parts. The matte black powder-coated frame is offered in four sizes, though the geometry chart leaves a lot to be desired. Reach doesn’t appear to be provided (the measurements are only labeled in A, B, C…), but assuming ‘B’ is top tube length, the medium is 559mm. According to the sizing chart, the Milo should fit riders from 5’1″ to 6’4″. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.roguefitness.com/the-milo#medium\" target=\"_blank\">roguefitness.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/belt-drive-stinner-designed-made-rogue-milo-commuter-is-now-selling-for-495/\">Belt Drive, Stinner Designed &amp; Made Rogue Milo Commuter is Now Selling for $495</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"00c623c9b943da9b556b0f1669accf70f6946f04c7e0fa4a327c1c264ae83ff3","category":"Cycling"}
