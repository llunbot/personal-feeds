The system wirelessly turns on the iPhone inside, updates its software to the latest version available, and then powers it off. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple developed \"Presto\" as a way to avoid selling iPhones in retail stores with outdated software. For example, the iPhone 15 series shipped with iOS 17, but Apple subsequently released iOS 17.0.1 before the devices launched. The point update was required to fix an issue that prevented the transfer of data directly from another iPhone during the initial setup process.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat meant new iPhone 15 owners had to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/warning-update-your-iphone-15-to-ios-17-0-2/\">update the devices themselves</a> as part of the setup process, or manually via the Settings app under General → Software Update if they opted to set up the device as new and transfer data later. Following the rollout of \"Presto,\" such a scenario will be avoidable, making the setup process more straightforward for end users.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/apple-iphone-in-box-update-system-rollout/\">Apple Readying In-Box iPhone Software Update System for Retail Stores</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-readying-in-box-iphone-software-update-system-for-retail-stores.2422738/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"691a2e2cc32f9694257186e183ece9e1f06622797be86fbee2a2e865a7f27a03","category":"Apple"}
