But when it’s down to its all-time low, we love it: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLXMVMV/?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 10th-gen iPad with 64GB of storage for $350</a> when you apply the coupon at checkout, a savings of $99 and matching the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10th-gen iPad arrived late last year as a complete overhaul of Apple’s entry-level tablet. It brought a 10.9-inch display, an A14 processor, a new design without a Home button, and a USB-C port for charging (and compatibility with the new $79 Apple Pencil). The deal is only good for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLCWFNM/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">silver</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLXMVMV/?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">blue</a> models once a coupon code is applied at checkout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10th-gen iPad is an excellent tablet but Apple has better options if you’re spending full price. At this discount, you should run to buy one since we don’t know how long it’s going to last.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"63ac3537ce2f469d07c0c85ac9dcb0d889efb19c046382c4b9b5e853081adab4","category":"Apple"}
