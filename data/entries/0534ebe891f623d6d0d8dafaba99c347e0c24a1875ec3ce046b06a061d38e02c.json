In fact, I’d like to think I’m more open to embracing new technology and ideas than most: I like <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/power-of-one-the-rise-of-the-1x-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">1× drivetrains</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/are-wider-tyres-faster\" target=\"_blank\">wide tyres</a>, narrow bars and see the merit in hookless rims too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A while back, I even wrote an opinion piece about <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/dropper-post-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">why I’d like to see more prevalent use of dropper posts in drop-bar bikes</a> (shout-out Matej Mohorič: I will forever regard his <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/milan-san-remo-2022-photos\" target=\"_blank\">descent of the Poggio</a> as one of the most impressive things I’ve seen done on a road bike). But I have to draw the line somewhere, and suspension is where I’ve chosen.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-groupset-names-meaning\">Opinion: Why do bicycle groupset names make no sense?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/which-bike-heart-vs-head\">Opinion: When you’re buying a bike, listen to your heart, not your head</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/dropper-post-road-bike\">Should we all be running dropper posts on our road bikes?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>The emergence of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-gravel-bike\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bikes</a> has created a stepping stone from the often fully suspended world of mountain bikes and given rise to a plethora of devices that aim to better insulate the rider from the road or trail. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These components are a common sight on gravel bikes and are featuring increasingly frequently on all-road or endurance bikes now too. There are pivoting stems, headset springs, short-travel forks, linkage seatposts and even integrated frame systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/07100438/bmc-urs-lt-1_copy-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"bmc-urs-lt-1_copy\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of them are nifty pieces of design but I just think they are solutions to problems that don’t exist for the majority of road and gravel riders. The risk of negatively impacting the speed and efficiency of the bike outweighs the reward of augmenting its comfort and control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rationalise my opinion thusly: we live in a tarmacked world. Yes, it’s nice to have the option to ride off-road, but any long ride in the UK will almost certainly have its fair share of tarmac. The beginning and end of a ride will be on the road, and stretches of bridleway and gravel trails will be connected by roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"842\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg 842w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-750x265.jpg 750w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On these smooth sections the only thing that’s fun is speed, which is created by bikes being light and efficient. That’s the reason why you never see riders on downhill rigs slogging along 15km of road to get to where they want to ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once off-road, suspension is often marketed as making the ride more fun, but does it truly do that? Whether via increased comfort or better traction and grip, it can definitely make you faster on technical ground, but off-road you don’t have to be going fast to have fun. That’s the reason ‘underbiking’ (tackling tougher terrain than your bike is designed for) is a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Too many balls to juggle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the smorgasbord of attributes gravel bikes need to have, designing a useful suspension device is very hard to achieve. You also have to factor in the diversity of terrain a gravel bike must cope with – by definition it tackles more types of surface than any other bike genre. So a suspension unit must have small bump sensitivity to glide over washboards or stony roads, but also enough travel to soak up bigger hits.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"canyon_grizl_suspension\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03002323/canyon_grizl_suspension.jpg 1280w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and it has to be small, sleek and light while doing that too, and not compromise frameset stiffness either. On a mountain bike the parameters for suspension are far simpler. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rider is going to ride exclusively on trails where they’ll hit big, technical stuff, so you need lots of suspension travel. Then the tyres are so big on modern mountain bikes they take care of smaller bumps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight, stiffness and aerodynamics aren’t hugely important on a mountain bike, but they are on a road or gravel bike, and I believe suspension compromises those things too much to make it a desirable feature. That’s not down to the poor design of the products we now have on offer, it’s just that those products are faced with too tall an order to generate a net advantage for the rider’s experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll do my best to remain as open-minded as possible and I won’t discount future developments – I’ve no doubt innovation in this area will continue apace – but for now at least, the only thing suspending me on my bike will be the air in its tyres. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Think Sam’s wrong and want to ogle some gravel bikes with suspension?
