They’ll usually have <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">mudguards</a> (or mudguard mounts, at the very least), often come equipped with lights, and there will probably be mounts for a rack, so you can carry extra stuff.</p>\n<p>But there are more specialist machines such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/canyon-pathlite-on/\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon Pathlite:ON</a>, where not only do you get lights, mudguards and a rack, but the higher-spec machines come with a second 500Wh battery for long-distance trekking.</p>\n<p>There are also flat-bar versions of sporty drop-bar road ebikes, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/orbea-gain-d10-e-bike-first-ride-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Orbea Gain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/focus-paralane2-9-7-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Focus Paralane 2</a>.</p>\n<p>Other options we’ve reviewed include the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/load-carrying-bikes/tern-gsd-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Tern GSD</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/rad-power-radwagon-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Rad Power RadWagon</a> electric cargo bikes, and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/orbea-katu-first-ride-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Orbea Katu-E</a>, an e-shopper.</p>\n<h3>Hybrid ebike motor systems</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bosch’s mid-mounted Active Line Plus motor.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Mid-mounted motors are a popular choice for hybrids. These have a motor mounted between the cranks that powers the rear wheel when you’re pedalling.</p>\n<p>It’s a position that provides plenty of stability because it puts the motor’s weight low down and centrally on the frame. Look out for systems from Bosch and Shimano. A rear-hub motor is another option, but front-wheel motors are less common on hybrids.</p>\n<p>Batteries are typically mounted low on the down tube, also for stability, although some hybrid electric bikes stash the battery out of sight within the frame.</p>\n<p>More expensive models tend to have larger-capacity batteries for additional range and there may be the option to plug in a second battery, if you want to go further.</p>\n<p>There’s usually a controller on the handlebar, where it’s within easy reach, that lets you select assistance level and keep an eye on your battery status as you ride.</p>\n<h3>Range</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This power-pack battery locks to the bike, so no fear of theft here.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Some quoted ranges are pretty accurate or even conservative, but look out for exaggerated claims if you’re planning to use your ebike for anything more than local excursions, or don’t have access to convenient charging.</p>\n<p>In general, you’ll want a battery capacity of 250Wh or more for a decent range. Most hybrid electric bike motors will push out a maximum of 250 watts, so that would give you an hour if you were using the motor at full power, though in reality that will rarely happen.</p>\n<p>In practice, the motor will be working less hard than this, but your real range will depend on where you’re riding, the assistance level selected and other factors.</p>\n<h3>Added extras</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ribble’s colour-coded rack comes as standard with the ‘Fully Loaded Edition’ spec.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For practicality, it’s nice to have mudguards and front and rear lights as part of the package, giving you all-weather ride-ability.</p>\n<p>Also look out for a rear rack or rack mounts, so you can use your hybrid ebike with panniers or other <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cycling-luggage/\" target=\"_blank\">cycling luggage</a> for shopping or longer excursions.</p>\n<p>And if you’re planning on longer rides on your ebike, the option to add a second battery will more-or-less double your range.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"d98382b6dbd513dca71e35274adec0149b14bf49eda73b3bbf155c4e931fb461","category":"Cycling"}
