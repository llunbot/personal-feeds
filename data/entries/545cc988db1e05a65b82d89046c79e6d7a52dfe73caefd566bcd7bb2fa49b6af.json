Faliero Masi built racing bikes in Italy for many of cycling’s greats. From Eddy Merckx and Fausto Coppi, who often “rebranded” Masi’s frames as their own. Faliero’s son <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/alberto-masi-and-the-vigorelli-velodrome-brian-vernor/\" target=\"_blank\">Alberto carried the torch of his father’s work in Italy</a> while rights to the Masi brand were bought by investors and an American division was opened in Southern California in the early 1970s.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-14.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-14.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-14.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-14.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-8.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-8.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-8.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-8.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-22.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-22.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-22.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-22.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Through this factory, many of the greatest US framebuilders worked on these “California Masi” frames. Mario Confente, Dave Moulton, Brian Baylis, and Albert Eisentraut. These California Masi frames are still rolling to this day and while bikes from Confente are rarer than hen’s teeth and continue to fetch upwards of $60k in the collector’s market, you can own a California Masi from the era for much less than that; typically around $2000 for a complete.</p>\n<p>That might sound like a deal comparatively, but for Santa Cruz framebuilder Paul Sadoff of Rock Lobster, it seemed like too much…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-6.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-6.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-4.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-4.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>“I kept looking at the prices and I thought to myself, why would I spend that much money when I can just build one myself? I have the original tubing, lugs, and more.” “When the California Masi factory shut down, the tubing and frame parts got bought up by builders. I ended up with some of it.” Paul said to me as we wheeled his new creation through the aisles at Sea Otter.</p>\n<p>Eagle-eyed collectors will be able to spot the inconsistencies with the California Masi bikes, but as Paul joked, “It’s still built in California!”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-33.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-33.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I combed through the bike during the heat of the day in the Laguna Seca Raceway. “Oh, yeah, the bottom bracket!” I exclaimed before handing the bike back over to Paul. Masi frames have an “M” carved in the bottom bracket shell. Surely Paul had that detail on his bootleg…</p>\n<p>“It’s the bottom bracket that kept me from wanting to make one but it came out pretty good.”</p>\n<p>I’d say so.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-1.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-1.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-1.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-1.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-32.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-32.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-32.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-32.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-27.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-27.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-27.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Paul-Sadoff-California-Masi-27.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Paul laced the frame with original decals and a full Campagnolo Nuovo Record group. It came out damn beautiful. And I bet it would fool a few collectors, even. Paul told me all the differences, some of which I caught while documenting the bike.</p>\n<p>What differences do you notice between this bike and the originals?</p>\n<p>Thanks to Paul Sadoff from Rock Lobster for being a fuckin’ legend. xo</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/paul-sadoff-california-masi/\">2025 Sea Otter Classic: Paul Sadoff and His “California” Masi</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"545cc988db1e05a65b82d89046c79e6d7a52dfe73caefd566bcd7bb2fa49b6af","category":"Cycling"}
