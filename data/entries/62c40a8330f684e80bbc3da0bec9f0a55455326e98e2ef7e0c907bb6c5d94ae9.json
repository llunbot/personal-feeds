The trailer has all the wise-cracking \"buddy cop\" vibes and fast-paced action we've come to expect from the franchise, including a trip to Vegas where Venom discovers the addictive allure of slot machines. But there are also hints of an inevitable bittersweet farewell—because this time they'll face off against Knull, god-creator of the symbiotes.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for <em>Venom</em> and <em>Venom: There Will Be Carnage</em> below.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/its-the-battle-of-the-alien-symbiotes-in-venom-let-there-be-carnage-trailer/\">previously reported</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_(2018_film)\">first film</a> in the franchise served as an origin story for our antihero. A bioengineering firm called the Life Foundation discovered a comet covered with symbiotic lifeforms and brought four samples back to Earth. Brock's then-fiancée, Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), showed him classified documents revealing that the foundation was conducting human/symbiote experiments. The symbiotes needed oxygen-breathing hosts to survive, but they invariably ended up killing those hosts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049665#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049665&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"62c40a8330f684e80bbc3da0bec9f0a55455326e98e2ef7e0c907bb6c5d94ae9","category":"Tech"}
