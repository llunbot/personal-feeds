Apple Pay Later had been available on an invite-only basis <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/apple-pay-later-early-access/\">since March</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Apple-Pay-Later.jpeg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nApple removed the following sentence from all Apple Pay Later support documents today:<blockquote>Apple Pay Later is currently only available to customers invited to access a prerelease version.</blockquote>Apple Pay Later is a \"buy now, pay later\" feature that lets qualifying customers split a purchase made with Apple Pay into four equal payments over six weeks, with no interest or fees. The feature is available for eligible purchases between $75 and $1,000 made on an iPhone or iPad on most websites and apps that accept Apple Pay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe minimum purchase amount required to use Apple Pay Later was $50 during the early access period, but Apple has now raised it to $75.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear if the wider launch of Apple Pay Later will be tied to the upcoming iOS 17.1 update or if it will happen with a server-side change.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEvery purchase made using Apple Pay Later is a separate loan and requires a new application, which has no impact on your credit score, according to Apple. The feature is available to U.S. residents who are 18 years of age or older. Apple Pay Later is currently unavailable in Hawaii, New Mexico, Wisconsin, and the U.S. territories.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Pay Later is part of the Wallet app on the iPhone, and found in the Settings app under Wallet &amp; Apple Pay on the iPad. Users can view, track, and manage loans, with upcoming payments shown on a calendar and payment reminders sent via Wallet notifications and email. Users must set up a debit card as a loan repayment method.\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pay-later/\">Apple Pay Later</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134\">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-pay-later-launches/\">Apple Pay Later Likely Officially Launching in the U.S. Imminently</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-later-likely-officially-launching-in-the-u-s-imminently.2408548/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f98026edbcb2a7537934f87371df83984c1f96819fd5c7b495e2172fe0bb8ff5","category":"Apple"}
