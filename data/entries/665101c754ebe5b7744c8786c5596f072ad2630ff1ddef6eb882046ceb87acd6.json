Ive also expressed both his  excitement and concern about the threat posed by AI and its unchecked speed of development: \"We need time to understand and react,\" he said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSteve Jobs died in 2011 from pancreatic cancer. Today would have been his <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/steve-jobs-would-have-been-70-today/\">70th birthday</a>. The emotional impact of Jobs' passing was evident in Ive's admission that he couldn't bring himself to read anything about his former colleague and friend for a decade after his death in 2011.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter leaving his role as chief design officer, Ive continued to work with Apple as a consultant through LoveFrom until 2022, when the partnership officially concluded. Ive has since officially <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/jony-ive-working-on-new-device-openai/\">confirmed</a> his involvement in an AI hardware project with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAmong Ive's musical choices on the long-running BBC radio show were \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\" by Simple Minds and part of the soundtrack from the Disney Pixar robot movie <em>Wall-E</em>.\r<br />\n<em>\r<br />\n(Via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/feb/23/iphone-designer-still-asks-i-wonder-what-steve-jobs-would-do-despite-being-told-not-to\">The Guardian</a>.)</em><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jony-ive/\">Jony Ive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theguardian-com/\">The Guardian</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/jony-ive-desert-island-discs-steve-jobs/\">Jony Ive Still Asks 'What Would Steve Do?'
