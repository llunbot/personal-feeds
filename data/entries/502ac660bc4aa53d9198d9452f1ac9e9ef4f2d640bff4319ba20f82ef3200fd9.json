Jerseys and bibs are understated and fuss-free, with minimal logos and coming in striking-but-tasteful block colours. It’s a long way from the heavily patterned and logo-strewn jerseys of, well… last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, fashion doesn’t preclude technology, and the kit on display here boasts advances in materials for comfort, breathability and aerodynamics. Plus there is a new focus on sustainability, meaning cyclists can go green in other ways too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So continue reading and take your pick. It looks like it’s going to be a bright summer for cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Summer kit 2025 brands at a glance:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• <a href=\"#h-gobik\">Gobik</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"#h-assos\">Assos</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"#h-bioracer\">Bioracer</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"#h-ekoi\">Ekoï</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"#h-lusso\">Lusso</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"#h-castelli\">Castelli</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"#h-santini\">Santini</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"#h-rapha\">Rapha</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"#h-sportful\">Sportful</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"#h-le-col\">Le Col</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gobik</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik1-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik1-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik1-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik1-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik1-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik1-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik1-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik1-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik1.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Him</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gobik Attitude 2.0 jersey, €95, <a href=\"https://gobik.com/en/products/short-sleeve-jersey-attitude-2-0-men-barossa\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at gobik.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Gobik Matt 2.0 bibshorts, €115, <a href=\"https://gobik.com/en/products/bib-short-matt-2-0-men-trooper-k10\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at gobik.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Gobik Second Skin base layer, €48, <a href=\"https://gobik.com/en/products/baselayer-second-skin-men-moonless\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at gobik.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Gobik Vortex 2.0 Salt socks, €35, <a href=\"https://gobik.com/en/products/socks-vortex-2-0-unisex-salt\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at gobik.com</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Ineos Grenadiers pro team, Gobik offers its race-oriented Lancer bib shorts, while the Matt 2.0 bib shorts shown here are more focussed on endurance. This is the Spanish brand’s ‘medium weight’ bibs for sweltering, long-distance rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Matt 2.0 shorts are lined with a bi-elastic Lycra to alleviate lactic acid build-up and muscle tension. The material is also durable and highly resistant to pilling, scoring a maximum five on an ISO-approved scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To support, the chamois padding uses a multi-density foam to promote blood flow and recovery through its supple central channel and memory foam properties. Gobik also claims the graphene-infused fabric helps ward off bacterial growth and excess moisture – essential if the weather replicates Gobik’s native Spanish sunshine.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik2-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik2-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik2-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik2-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik2-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik2-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik2-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik2-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Gobik2.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Her</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gobik CX Solid jersey, €85, <a href=\"https://gobik.com/en/products/short-sleeve-jersey-cx-solid-unisex-sprout\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at gobik.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Gobik Matt 2.0 bibshorts, €115, <a href=\"https://gobik.com/en/products/bib-short-matt-2-0-women-aura-k9\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at gobik.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Gobik Second Skin base layer, €48, <strong><a href=\"https://gobik.com/en/products/baselayer-second-skin-men-moonless\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at gobik.com</a></strong></strong><br /><strong><strong>Gobik Vortex 2.0 Salt socks, €35, <a href=\"https://gobik.com/en/products/socks-vortex-2-0-unisex-salt\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at gobik.com</a></strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gobik’s CX Solid jersey builds on the brand’s best-selling XC Pro to create a unisex garment for summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed to balance comfort and performance, it uses a stretchy polyamide-based fabric Gobik calls Evoflex, which boasts ‘multidirectional elasticity’. It provides a close fit that’s snug, breathable and aerodynamic without any awkward pinching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sleeves have a streamlined focus, having been lengthened to a laser-cut seamless finish closer to the elbows. Gobik says this smooth surface ‘eliminates friction, providing greater aerodynamics and comfort’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the aero front, the jersey has a hidden collar, thermosealed zip and flat-seam cargo pockets, plus it has 40+ UPF protection to protect you in the sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Assos</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos1-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos1-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos1-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos1-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos1-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos1-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos1-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos1-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos1.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Him</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Assos Mille GTS Jersey S11, £165, <a href=\"https://www.assos.com/gb/mille-gts-jersey-s11-11-20-399-2a.html\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at assos.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Assos Summer NS Skin Layer, £65, <a href=\"https://www.assos.com/gb/summer-ns-skin-layer-p1-p11-40-466-1o.html\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at assos.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Assos Mille GTS Bibshorts S11, £215, <a href=\"https://www.assos.com/gb/mille-gts-bib-shorts-s11-11-10-288-18.html\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at assos.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Assos Endurance socks S11 £16, <a href=\"https://www.assos.com/gb/endurance-socks-s11-p13-60-776-58.html\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at assos.com</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re going a long way, it helps to have a jersey with a zip that <em>doesn’t</em> go all the way. Assos’s Mille GTS Jersey S11 is aimed at endurance rides in hot temperatures and comes with a ¾ length zip. This leaves a zip-free bottom section Assos calls zeroPressure Waist, which is very lightweight and breathable and cradles the stomach area to give stability and support without rippling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top section is made from a highly elastic fabric for an aerodynamic fit that still promotes comfort and cooling breathability, while the back section is made from Stabilizator V11, a textile that is light and cool but rigid enough to prevent sagging at the pockets. Throw in UPF50+ sun protection and you have a jersey that is perfect for the long days of summer.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos2-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos2-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos2-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos2-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos2-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos2-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos2-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos2-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Assos2.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Her</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Assos UMA GT Jersey S11, £115, <a href=\"https://www.assos.com/gb/uma-gt-jersey-s11-12-20-379-6p.html\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at assos.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Assos Summer NS Skin Layer, £65, <a href=\"https://www.assos.com/gb/women-s-summer-ns-skin-layer-p1-p12-40-468-1o.html\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at assos.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Assos Uma GTV Bibshorts C2 Evo, £265, <a href=\"https://www.assos.com/gb/uma-gtv-bib-shorts-c2-evo-12-10-271-18.html\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at assos.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Assos Endurance socks S11, £16, <strong><a href=\"https://www.assos.com/gb/endurance-socks-s11-p13-60-776-58.html\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at assos.com</a></strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When comfort for the long haul is a priority, Assos’s UMA GTV bib shorts are a woman’s best friend. The Volkano main fabric is not only silky-smooth and compressive but also comes with UPF50+ sun protection, odour control and cooling properties to help on hot rides. Any long day in the saddle is going to require the occasional nature break, so the UMA GTV comes with Bisiclick, a pair of magnetic closures at the base of the bibstraps, which can be undone for easy removal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chamois is the plushest in Assos’s armoury, with two layers of shock-absorbing foam and cutaways to reduce friction. What’s more, the insert is only attached to the main fabric at the front and back, allowing it to ‘float’ so it moves with the body. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the UMA GTV bibs, no ride is too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bioracer</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Bioracer1-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Bioracer1-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Bioracer1-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Bioracer1-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Bioracer1-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Bioracer1-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Bioracer1-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Bioracer1-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Bioracer1.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Him</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bioracer Epic jersey, £76.57, <a href=\"https://shop.bioracer.com/product/epic_jersey_thyme_green/\" target=\"_blank\">buy now from shop.bioracer.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Bioracer Breeze base layer, £34.42, <a href=\"https://shop.bioracer.com/product/short-sleeve-breeze-base-layer-white/\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at shop.bioracer.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Bioracer Epic bibshorts, £111.69, <a href=\"https://shop.bioracer.com/product/epic_bibshorts_nautica/\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at shop.bioracer.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Bioracer Tech socks, £20.37, <a href=\"https://shop.bioracer.com/product/tech_socks_thyme_green/\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at shop.bioracer.com</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our priority was to develop the Epic bib shorts around the riding position, improving comfort, compression and breathability,’ says Bioracer’s product design manager, Ella Leys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To that end, the shorts provide differing levels compression throughout and they have grippers placed directly into the fabric to eliminate extra seams and, in turn, improve comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Epic bib shorts are also Bioracer’s first to get the 3D WavePad chamois. ‘We worked with our pad supplier to create a chamois that is already shaped like a rider’s body,’ Leys says. ‘We performed some pressure tests to see the difference and figure out where to reduce friction and pressure points.

The result is a 6% reduction in CdA compared to the previous jersey.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a similar story with the Free Aero Race S bib shorts, which use a textured pattern to reduce the garment’s coefficient of drag by 3% over the previous generation.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Castelli2-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Castelli2-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Castelli2-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Castelli2-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Castelli2-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Castelli2-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Castelli2-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Castelli2-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Castelli2.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Her</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Castelli Premio Evo W jersey, £215, <a href=\"https://saddleback.co.uk/products/castelli-premio-evo-womens-jersey?variant=55049275113859\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at saddleback.co.uk</a></strong><br /><strong>Castelli Pro Mesh W sleeveless base layer, £49, <a href=\"https://saddleback.co.uk/products/castelli-pro-mesh-womens-sleeveless-base-layer?_pos=1&amp;_psq=castelli+pro+mes&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at saddleback.co.uk</a></strong><br /><strong>Castelli Premio Evo W bibshorts, £279, <a href=\"https://saddleback.co.uk/products/castelli-premio-evo-womens-shorts?_pos=7&amp;_sid=95c6d1847&amp;_ss=r\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at saddleback.co.uk</a></strong><br /><strong>Castelli Premio Evo W socks £22, <a href=\"https://saddleback.co.uk/products/castelli-premio-evo-womens-12-socks?_pos=4&amp;_psq=castelli+premio+evo+w&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at saddleback.co.uk</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Fewer panels equals fewer seams equals more comfort,’ says Wise of the new Premio Evo bib shorts. ‘The key is the gradient-woven fabric, where the weave is progressively layered to create different stretch properties. A single panel of fabric can have different stretch properties in different areas, akin to having multiple fabrics without the seams.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In essence that means the Premio Evo is mostly made up of one large panel of fabric that’s stretchier over the hip, for example, for less pedalling restriction, yet more compressive around the thigh for muscle support and better aerodynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paired with the Premio Evo jersey, Wise claims the overall outfit is superbly comfortable, fast wicking and very fast in wind-tunnel testing, and yet isn’t designed explicitly for racing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Santini</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini1-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini1-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini1-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini1-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini1-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini1-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini1-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini1-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini1.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Him</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Santini RTR jersey, £90, <a href=\"https://www.santinicycling.com/en/unisex/rtr-jersey-unisex-5987.html\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at santinicycling.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Santini RTR bibshorts, £150, <a href=\"https://www.santinicycling.com/en/men-s-cycling-bib-shorts/rtr-bib-shorts-5952.html\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at santinicycling.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Santini RTR Wind Jacket, £95, <a href=\"https://www.santinicycling.com/en/unisex/rtr-wind-jacket-5849.html\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at santinicycling.com</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The concept behind the RTR [Ready To Ride] range was to create good-quality, highly durable garments in a large number of colours that can be mixed and matched to your taste,’ says Santini’s creative director, Fergus Niland. ‘The big difference is how we obtain those colours.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RTR collection is created using the ‘garment dyeing’ method, which means making each item in plain white and then dyeing the whole garment, rather than stitching together pre-dyed fabric. It allows Santini to produce only the most requested colours, avoiding overproduction and waste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It means we can cut down massively on the amount of material that we have to buy in and the amount of energy and water we have to use to produce these products,’ says Niland. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini2-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini2-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini2-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini2-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini2-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini2-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini2-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini2-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Santini2.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Her</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Santini RTR jersey, £90, <a href=\"https://www.santinicycling.com/en/unisex/rtr-jersey-unisex-5989.html\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at santinicycling.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Santini RTR bibshorts, £150, <a href=\"https://www.santinicycling.com/en/women-s-bib-shorts/5s1062gilrtr-5940.html\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at santinicycling.com</a></strong><br /><strong>Santini RTR Wind Jacket, £95, <a href=\"https://www.santinicycling.com/en/unisex/rtr-wind-jacket-5851.html\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at santinicycling.com</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Santini RTR bib shorts are produced using the same garment dyeing technique as the RTR jerseys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As a manufacturer we have a responsibility to reduce the quantity of materials and garments that go to landfill,’ says Niland. ‘RTR has been in development for a good two years now because it’s not simple when you’re dealing with technical fabrics that stretch.

The bib shorts also feature two cargo pockets on the small of the back and a DMS seatpad, which is shorter and more padded at the sit bones, again to complement a more upright ride position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result, says Wise, ‘is a versatile kit that is exceptional value for money’.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sportful2-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sportful2-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sportful2-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sportful2-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sportful2-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sportful2-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sportful2-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sportful2-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sportful2.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Her</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sportful Supergiara Logo W jersey, £90, <a href=\"https://saddleback.co.uk/products/sportful-supergiara-logo-womens-jersey?variant=55049178349955\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at saddleback.co.uk</a></strong><br /><strong>Sportful Pro W sleeveless base layer, £50, <a href=\"https://saddleback.co.uk/products/sportful-pro-base-layer-womens-sleeveless?_pos=2&amp;_sid=03332f298&amp;_ss=r\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at saddleback.co.uk</a></strong><br /><strong>Sportful Supergiara 2 W bibshorts, £150, <a href=\"https://saddleback.co.uk/products/sportful-supergiara2-womens-bib-shorts?_pos=14&amp;_sid=6b4bfeff2&amp;_ss=r\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at saddleback.co.uk</a></strong><br /><strong>Sportful Pro socks, £16, <a href=\"https://saddleback.co.uk/products/sportful-pro-womens-socks?_pos=4&amp;_psq=sportful+pro+socks&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at saddleback.co.uk</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Supergiara is aimed at riders who want technical kit with plenty of storage,’ says Wise.

Up top, the jersey features the traditional three rear pockets plus two side mesh pockets; below, the bib shorts have two cargo pockets on the thighs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Whether you’re a weekend gravel rider, a gravel pro doing the longest races or a road rider doing endurance events, the Supergiara kit is for you.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Le Col</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol2-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol2-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol2-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol2-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol2-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol2-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol2-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol2-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol2.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Him</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Le Col Pro Aero jersey, £160, <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/products/pro-aero-jersey-1?variant=41493598240831\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at lecol.cc</a></strong><br /><strong>Le Col Pro Air sleeveless base layer, £50, <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/products/pro-air-sleeveless-base-layer?variant=41398358868031\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at lecol.cc</a></strong><br /><strong>Le Col Pro II bibshorts, £185, <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/products/pro-bib-shorts?variant=39962077167679\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at lecol.cc</a></strong><br /><strong>Le Col Block Cycling socks, £17, <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/products/block-cycling-socks?variant=41389467500607\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at lecol.cc</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le Col’s Pro II bib shorts are geared around going fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Having been tested in the wind-tunnel, these shorts are perfect for high-intensity efforts or long rides in the drops,’ says Charlotte Moulson, Le Col’s brand and product marketing manager. ‘They offer a sleek profile and second skin-like fit without compromising on comfort.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is achieved by cleverly cutting the shorts’ main panels to minimise seams when constructed, and using a close-fitting, warp-knit fabric that compresses and supports the working muscles. The comfort element is grounded in a top-quality chamois that uses memory foam inserts to help stabilise the wearer’s sit bones on the saddle and absorb vibrations when riding hard.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol1-647x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol1-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol1-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol1-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol1-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol1-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol1-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol1-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/LeCol1.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Her</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Le Col Pro jersey, £145, <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/products/womens-pro-jersey?variant=41494480388159\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at lecol.cc</a></strong><br /><strong>Le Col Pro Air Sleeveless base layer, £50, <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/products/womens-pro-air-sleeveless-base-layer-1?variant=41550858879039\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at lecol.cc</a></strong><br /><strong>Le Col Pro bibshorts, £185, <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/products/womens-pro-bib-shorts?variant=39962074873919\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at lecol.cc</a></strong><br /><strong>Le Col Cycling socks, £17, <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/products/cycling-socks?variant=41389472645183\" target=\"_blank\">buy now at lecol.cc</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’re excited this year to introduce an even more refined iteration of our popular Pro jersey,’ says Moulson. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that the rider makes up the bulk of the aerodynamic drag they face, the main updates that Le Col has built into the latest generation Pro jersey attempt to improve the rider’s efficiency in the wind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘A more articulated fit and sleek, bonded sleeves and hem streamline the jersey’s fit against the body,’ says Moulson. ‘Plus the rear pocket arrangement has been redesigned to be lighter but more robust, so kit can be stored more neatly without the jersey losing any of its intended fit.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The jersey doesn’t represent speed achieved at any cost, however. The fabric itself, though tailored to be aero, is lightweight and therefore ventilates freely to avoid overheating.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/summer-kit-supplement-2025\">The 2025 selection of premium summer cycling kit</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"502ac660bc4aa53d9198d9452f1ac9e9ef4f2d640bff4319ba20f82ef3200fd9","category":"Cycling"}
