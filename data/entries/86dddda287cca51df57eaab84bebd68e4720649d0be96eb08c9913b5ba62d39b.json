{"title":"‘Lengthy Memoranda and Gobbledygook Language’","link":"https://archive.org/details/Maverick1944MemoAboutGobbledygook","date":1710820799000,"content":"\n<p>Maury Maverick, chairman and general manager of the Smaller War Plants Corporation, in a company-wide memo back in 1944:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Be short and use Plain English. </p>\n\n<p>Memoranda should he as short as clearness will allow. The Naval \nofficer who wired “Sighted Sub - Sank Same” told the whole story. </p>\n\n<p>Put the real subject matter — the <em>point</em> — and even the \nconclusion, in the opening paragraph and the whole story on one \npage. Period! If a lengthy explanation, statistical matter, or \nsuch is necessary, use attachments. </p>\n\n<p>Stay off gobbledygook language. It only fouls people up. For the \nLord’s sake, be short and say what you’re talking about. Let’s \nstop “pointing-up” programs, “finalizing” contracts that “stem \nfrom” district, regional or Washington “levels”. There are no \n“levels” — local government is as high as Washington Government. \nNo more patterns, effectuating, dynamics. Anyone using the words \n“activation” or “implementation” will be shot. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>80-year-old advice that holds up today. Also: this is the first known use of <em><a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gobbledygook\">gobbledygook</a></em>, a fabulous word with no true synonym. (Thanks to DF reader David Wooten for the link.)</p>\n\n<p>(Also: Who had a cooler name? Maury Maverick or the Smaller War Plants Corporation?)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/18/gobbledygook\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"86dddda287cca51df57eaab84bebd68e4720649d0be96eb08c9913b5ba62d39b","category":"Tech"}
