Firefly worked with its long-time partner Josh Ogle to design 3D printed Ti fork crowns and dropouts for Road, Road Plus, and All Road/Gravel models, covering a huge range of riding from road to gravel, with tire clearance options from 700 x 32mm to 700 x 55mm and 650 x 57mm. Those 3D printed parts are shaped to match perfectly with ovalized Ti fork legs and tapered carbon steerer tubes, allowing Firefly to build forks that are light, fast, and strike the right balance of ride quality characteristics: stiff enough for precise handling and braking, never harsh feeling, and nearly as light as full carbon forks.</p>\n<p>The advantages of 3D printing extend beyond the surface too. The brand is taking full advantage of the 3D design with internal routing in the fork crown for simple brake routing on all models, and innovative dynamo wire routing in Road Plus and All Road fork crowns, including split routing for both lights and steerer tube-mounted chargers like the Sinewave Beacon, or light switches like the Velolumino TMAT switch…</p>\n<p>See full specs for each model at <a href=\"https://fireflybicycles.com/custom-forks/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefly Bicycles</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/image-2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/image-2-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/image-2-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/image-2-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/image-2-scaled.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/image-2-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/image-2-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/image-2-scaled.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/image-2-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/image-2-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.garbaruk.com/garbaruk-road-crankset.html?category=33\" target=\"_blank\">Garbaruk Road/Gravel Crankset</a> 420.00 €</h3>\n<p>Known for its ultralight and ultra flash componentry, Garbaruk just upped the ante with a new 7075 aluminum crankset and chainring for gravel and road (non-boost) applications.

Conservation is important to us, and a clear rule that helps the BLM protect and support healthy landscapes is something we would support. In order to explicitly support the new BLM Public Lands rule, mountain bikers need clarification.</p>\n<p>It is difficult for us to clearly answer, “How is this going to impact mountain bikers and trails?” This is partially because a rule is a framework for case-by-case decision making during cyclical land planning processes at the local and regional level within the BLM. It’s also because much is unclear in this version of the proposed rule. Because of the ambiguity and lack of clear definitions, it is especially important for us to uplift our questions and the voices of mountain bikers.</p>\n<p>There could be negative implications: this rule could allow decisions to be made to restrict access to mountain bike trails in areas where land/trail health is an issue. There could be positive implications: sustainable recreation positively impacts conservation efforts in people-power and advocacy for protecting the places we play. This could lend itself to helping BLM land managers approve sustainable trail construction projects that promote protection of intact landscapes and responsible recreation.</p>\n<p>If we say nothing, the thousands of individual voices of mountain bikers and other recreation enthusiasts are not part of the conversation. If one or two of us write a letter, maybe we’re acknowledged, but the voices of the many stakeholders involved in BLM land planning, from recreation to resource extraction, drown out our perspective. Please lift up your voice and the needs of our mountain bike communities across the country.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-81.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-81.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-81.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-81.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-81.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-81.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-81.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-81.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-76.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-76.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-76.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-76.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-76.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-76.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-76.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/MoabNovember-76.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Take Action Now!</strong></p>\n<p>The new “Public Lands Rule” could support conservation on 245 million acres of public lands, but mountain bikers need more information. The BLM and your lawmakers need to hear from you about how sustainable trails and outdoor recreation contribute to conservation, support healthy landscapes, and are important parts of managing public lands now and into the future.
