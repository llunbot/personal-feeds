The annual developers conference begins with Apple's keynote <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/23/apple-announces-wwdc-2023-schedule/\">on Monday, June 5</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/MacBook-Air-Multiple-Sizes-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWhile we wait for the new MacBook Air to be announced, we have recapped five new features that have been rumored or are likely for the laptop.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>15-Inch Display</h3>\r<br />\nThe new MacBook Air will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/15/15-inch-macbook-air-spring-2023/\">equipped with a larger 15.5-inch display</a>, according to reliable display industry analyst Ross Young. The current MacBook Air has a 13.6-inch display, and the laptop was offered in an 11-inch size many years ago.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/12/oled-macbook-air-ipad-pro-2024/\">13-inch MacBook Air with an OLED display</a> is rumored to launch in 2024, the 15-inch model is expected to have a traditional LCD.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>M2 Chip</h3>\r<br />\nLike the 13-inch MacBook Air, the 15-inch model will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/20/kuo-15-inch-macbook-air-two-m2-chip-options/\">available with the M2 chip</a>, according to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Apple says the M2 chip has up to an 18% faster CPU, up to a 35% faster GPU, and up to a 40% faster Neural Engine compared to the M1 chip, for those who are considering upgrading from a 2020 MacBook Air.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Longer Battery Life</h3>\r<br />\nWith a 15-inch display, the new MacBook Air would have a larger chassis, allowing for a larger battery and longer battery life.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says the 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip lasts up to 18 hours per charge, so perhaps the 15-inch model could get closer to the 20-hour mark. Apple silicon chips continue to have industry-leading performance-per-watt.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Wi-Fi 6E</h3>\r<br />\nWhile the 13-inch MacBook Air is limited to Wi-Fi 6, there is a good chance that the 15-inch model will be upgraded to Wi-Fi 6E. Apple released new 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini models with Wi-Fi 6E in January.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWi-Fi 6 operates on the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, while Wi-Fi 6E also works over the 6GHz band, allowing for faster wireless speeds, lower latency, and less signal interference. To take advantage of these benefits, the device must be connected to a Wi-Fi 6E router, available from brands like TP-Link, Asus, and Netgear.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Bluetooth 5.3</h3>\r<br />\nApple has added Bluetooth 5.3 to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/07/iphone-14-new-airpods-pro-bluetooth-5-3/\">several of its latest devices</a>, and the 15-inch MacBook Air could be next in line to gain support. Bluetooth 5.3 offers benefits such as improved reliability and power efficiency compared to Bluetooth 5.2.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/31/15-inch-macbook-air-rumored-features-list/\">New MacBook Air Expected at WWDC Next Week With These Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-macbook-air-expected-at-wwdc-next-week-with-these-features.2391148/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ef2af5ab31766a2dbba3eb9dec6ba7ddd871e51fa3dbe5b5fe03fcd90456e59a","category":"Apple"}
