The university said current students are still able to use their physical ID, or the digital version if they prefer, but incoming undergraduates will no longer be issued a plastic card starting this summer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe digital ID can be used to access dorms, libraries, gyms, book stores, and other areas on and off campus, and to pay for meals and laundry around campus. Express Mode is <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208965\">turned on automatically</a> for student IDs added to Apple Wallet, allowing students to simply hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near a card reader to gain access. If this mode is turned off, authenticating with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode is required.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Wallet has supported student IDs <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/02/apple-wallet-student-ids-launch-at-three-unis/\">since late 2018</a>, and the technology is now available at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_campus_identifications_in_mobile_wallets\">dozens of colleges and universities</a> across the U.S. and Canada. Purdue says it has around 50,000 students at its West Lafayette campus.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/19/purdue-student-ids-apple-wallet-app/\">Purdue Becomes Latest University to Launch Student IDs in Apple Wallet App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/purdue-becomes-latest-university-to-launch-student-ids-in-apple-wallet-app.2387263/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f43c61bb9c69955d2ccffc71caad5a1a62afcb7b9d77bf1cf1119b240ebb0358","category":"Apple"}
