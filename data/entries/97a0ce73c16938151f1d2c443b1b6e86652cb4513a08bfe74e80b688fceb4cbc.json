The hub shell can be purchased in a 28-hole straight-pull option or with 32 holes for J-bend spokes.</p>\n<p>UK, American and Australian pricing is to be confirmed.</p>\n<h2>‘The widest gear range on the market’</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s certainly less of a ‘dinner plate’ than what we’ve become accustomed to.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Classified</i></span></div>\n<p>The Powershift Boost hub is paired with a new Classified 11-40t 12-speed cassette. The one-piece compact steel cassette has a gear range of 530 per cent, which Classified claims to be the largest of any <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/drivetrains-explained-all-of-the-parts-that-make-your-bike-go/\">drivetrain</a> on the market.</p>\n<p>For reference, SRAM’s 10-52t mountain bike cassettes offer a 520 per cent range.</p>\n<p>Classified says the additional gears are all available in the middle of the cassette to avoid <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/cross-chaining/\">cross-chaining</a>. For reference, the sprocket jumps on the cassette are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 22, 25, 29, 34, 40.</p>\n<p>The cassette is compatible with existing 142mm variants of the Powershift hub, so you can use the cassette as part of a mullet drivetrain on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>The cassette is claimed to weigh 248g. Classified isn’t launching an 11-speed equivalent cassette at this stage.</p>\n<h2>Meet the Ringshifter</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Ringshifter doesn’t take up much space on your handlebar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Classified</i></span></div>\n<p>Classified is also debuting the Ringshifter – a wireless shifter mounted to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-handlebars/\">handlebar</a> that controls the two-speed hub and is said to weigh 24g.</p>\n<p>The brand claims it uses a ‘unique magnetic spring back mechanism’ to improve feedback through the shifter. According to Classified, the Ringshifter can perform 10,000 shifts before needing to be recharged with the provided magnetic USB cable.</p>\n<p>The shifter can be installed on either side of the handlebar to suit your preferences.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h2>Analysis | Do we need Classified on mountain bikes? </h2>\n<p>Although it seems as if manufacturers are hell-bent on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-t-type-eagle-transmission/\">consigning the derailleur hanger to history</a>, a happy equilibrium appears to have been reached on mountain bike gear ratios. </p>\n<p>It’s been a long road (or, rather, trail) to get to this point. </p>\n<p>SRAM <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-xx1-first-ride-review/\">introduced its first dedicated 1x drivetrain in 2012 with XX1</a> and then turned things up to 12-speed in 2016 when <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/sram-12-speed-xx1-and-x01-eagle/\">it debuted the Eagle ecosystem</a>. </p>\n<p>Shimano has since followed suit and it would be fair to say front derailleurs are very rarely – if ever – seen on performance mountain bikes now. </p>\n<p>SRAM offers cassette sizes up to 52t in its Eagle range, and Shimano one tooth smaller. Both brands use smaller 10t starting cogs to provide a suitable descending gear. </p>\n<p>SRAM’s latest T-Type Eagle Transmission may rip up the groupset rulebook by introducing a direct-mount rear derailleur, but the brand hasn’t diverted from its winning gear-ratio recipe. </p>\n<p>With the extended range, the current crop of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrains</a> offer options for both lung-busting climbs and the steepest descents. </p>\n<p>Classified’s new Powershift Boost hub offers both extended range and double the gear count – but is that something mountain bikers are crying out for? </p>\n<p>Well, the extended range could come in handy in a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/bikepacking/\">bikepacking</a> scenario, considering the extra weight of luggage. The ability to have smaller jumps between cogs could prove an advantage in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cross-country-racing-guide/\">cross-country racing</a> too.</p>\n<p>However, with 1x now so dominant, mountain bikers as a whole may take some convincing. Will Classified be able to change MTB gearing once again? Only time will tell. </p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"97a0ce73c16938151f1d2c443b1b6e86652cb4513a08bfe74e80b688fceb4cbc","category":"Cycling"}
