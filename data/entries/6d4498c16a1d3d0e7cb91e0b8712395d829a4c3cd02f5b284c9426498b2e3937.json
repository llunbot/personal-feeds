{"title":"Yankees Loosen The Boss’s Facial Hair Policy","link":"https://www.mlb.com/yankees/news/yankees-change-facial-hair-policy","date":1740154245000,"content":"\n<p>Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“In recent weeks I have spoken to a large number of former and\ncurrent Yankees — spanning several eras — to elicit their\nperspectives on our longstanding facial hair and grooming policy,\nand I appreciate their earnest and varied feedback. These most\nrecent conversations are an extension of ongoing internal dialogue\nthat dates back several years.</p>\n\n<p>“Ultimately the final decision rests with me, and after great\nconsideration, we will be amending our expectations to allow our\nplayers and uniformed personnel to have well-groomed beards moving\nforward. It is the appropriate time to move beyond the familiar\ncomfort of our former policy.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The appropriate time to change this was years ago, but better late than never. It’s the most Yankees story possible that this policy change is much bigger news than the fact that the team today also signed manager Aaron Boone to a two-year extension through the 2027 season. MLB reporter Bryan Hoch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The grooming policy dates to George M. Steinbrenner’s purchase of\nthe team. As the legend goes, its roots grew in 1973, when\nSteinbrenner observed his team on the first-base line for Opening\nDay against the Cleveland Indians.</p>\n\n<p>Steinbrenner was not yet “The Boss,” so new in the role that he\ncould not identify the players by their faces. Instead, he focused\nupon their hair — unkempt mustaches, mutton chops and shaggy\nlocks. He scowled, scribbling uniform numbers on a scrap of paper\nurgently dispatched to manager Ralph Houk. Tell these men to get a\nhaircut, Steinbrenner commanded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My favorite Yankee, Don Mattingly, not only ran into grief over this policy with George Steinbrenner, but <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BMzeznCyX8w\">again with the next team he played for</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/21/yankees-facial-hair\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6d4498c16a1d3d0e7cb91e0b8712395d829a4c3cd02f5b284c9426498b2e3937","category":"Tech"}
