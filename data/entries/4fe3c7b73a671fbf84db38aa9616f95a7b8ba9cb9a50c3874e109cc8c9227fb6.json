Aluminium Bar is 800mm wide uncut.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Building on the widely acclaimed performance of its carbon fibre handlebar, OneUp’s new Aluminium Bar is claimed to offer the same bump-numbing performance without sacrificing steering accuracy, while also beating the competition on both metrics.</p>\n<p>An oval-shaped portion near where the bar rises is said to help it ‘flex’ to dampen vibrations.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img

35mm rise version of the bar weighs a respectable 341g.</p>\n<p>A lower 20mm rise is available, but all versions have a 5-degree upsweep and 8-degree backsweep.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n

stiffness is possible, but objectively measuring either isn’t clear cut.</p>\n<p>We’ve been very impressed with the carbon version, so stay tuned for a full review of this model.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>£79.50
