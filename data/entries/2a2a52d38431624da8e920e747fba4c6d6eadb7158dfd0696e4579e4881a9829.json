It’s powered by OpenAI’s automatic speech recognition \nsystem <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/whisper\">Whisper</a>, and features two powerful models for fast and \naccurate transcriptions. </p>\n\n<p>Best of all, unlike traditional transcription services, Transcribe \nworks for free inside of Audio Hijack. There’s absolutely no \non-going cost, so you can generate unlimited transcriptions and \nnever again pay a per-minute charge. It’s pretty incredible. </p>\n\n<p>It’s also completely private. When you use Transcribe, everything \nhappens right on your Mac. That means your data is never sent to \nthe cloud, nor shared with anyone else. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This makes for a perfect one-two shot with Retrobatch 2: Audio Hijack is also a node-based media tool (which predates Retrobatch), and this new Transcribe block is also putting powerful machine learning tools into an easily accessible form.</p>\n\n<p>This Transcribe feature in Audio Hijack is also an exemplar of the power of Apple silicon — it works on Intel-based Macs too, but it’s just incredibly fast on Apple silicon (I suspect because of the Neural Engine on every M-series chip).</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/25/audio-hijack-transcribe\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2a2a52d38431624da8e920e747fba4c6d6eadb7158dfd0696e4579e4881a9829","category":"Tech"}
