A variant of these Ultra Endurance tubes, Eclipse’s 19.5g Ultra Race design, lays claim to that lofty title, but they are only for 20-25mm tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more practical option is the Ultra Endurance, which fits tyres from 25-35mm but still only weighs a scant 29g (with the 70mm valve stem, opting for the 40mm valve stem drops the weight to 27g).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret to Eclipse’s outstanding light weight is the use of Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) to make the bladder instead of using butyl, as is more common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TPU is simply better in performance terms. It’s recyclable, retains air better, is more puncture resistant and more supple than butyl. Alright, these Ultra Endurance tubes are 5-6 times the cost of normal tubes, but for the advantages they offer I can think of worse areas on a bike in which to splash the cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-15-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Eclipse bicycle inner tubes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-15-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-15-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-15-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-15-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-15-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-15-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-15-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-15-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-15.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Eclipse says its Ultra tubes stand out from others in the category – the Vittorias, Tubolitos, Pirellis and the rest – by achieving a similar weight while still offering an alloy valve stem with a removable core. Competitors tend to use plastic stems with bonded-in cores. Eclipse says this boosts its tubes’ durability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The myriad benefits of TPU tubes may be greeted with a shoulder shrug by tubeless users, but products like Eclipse’s Ultra Endurance tubes still have something to offer them too, even if the benefit a little more indirect. Given that TPU tubes tend to save at least 100g over butyl tubes and take up around the third of the space, they make just as much sense to carry in a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bikepacking-bags\" target=\"_blank\">saddlebag</a> – they offer a solution to make your pack smaller and lighter while still providing a last-resort option should the might of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">tubeless</a> ever fail you.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.upgradebikes.co.uk/Catalogue/Inner-Tubes-and-Rim-Tapes/Eclipse/Ultra-Endurance\" target=\"_blank\">Upgrade Bikes (£30)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>ODI Performance 3.5mm bar tape</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-7-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"ODI performance bar tape\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-7-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-7-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-7-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-7-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-7-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-7-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-7.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ODI might be better known for its MTB grips, but its first <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/the-best-road-bike-handlebar-tape-and-how-to-wrap-it\" target=\"_blank\">bar tape</a> design, Performance 2.5mm, has been well received: the surface elastomer is soft but tacky and the foam backing claims to dissipate vibration.

A similar tacky surface elastomer is used in an attempt to carry over a balance of tackiness and comfort, but the 3.5mm tape includes perforations to create some mechanical grip as well this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tape is three-ply instead of two, with double the number of shock-absorbing layers. ODI says those layers are different densities, which combine to attenuate vibration better than one solid material. The tape’s design should make it ideal for those looking for extra comfort on long rides or over rough ground – as ODI says it stands up well to washing too, it should be a decent <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bike</a> option.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>BSC Tools Press-fit bottom bracket remover set 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-9-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"BSC Tool press-fit extractor tool\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-9-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-9-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-9-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-9-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-9-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-9-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-9-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-9-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-9.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/press-fit-vs-threaded-bb\" target=\"_blank\">not an opinion I share with all of my colleagues</a>, I love a press-fit bottom bracket. When correctly designed and manufactured to proper tolerances, they are mechanically superior to threaded alternatives. I also prefer installing them: it’s more satisfying to smoothly squeeze a cup into a frame than wind one into a thread.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I will concede that it’s a different story when it comes to removal. Inserting a pronged extractor and whacking it with a hammer to coax pressed-in cups out of fragile carbon fibre frames that cost more than my car is not a job I relish.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"BSC Tool press-fit extractor tool\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-10-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/in-the-drops-12-05-23-10.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is why it brought joy to my heart to see BSC Tools release an extractor tool that largely mimics the press-fit cup installation method, only in reverse. A selection of extractor cup and puller sizes are included with the nicely machined tool, ensuring near-universal compatibility with the main press-fit derivations you’re likely to come across.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The puller sits on the end of the threaded rod and hooks behind the press-fit cup, with the appropriately-sized extractor sitting over the cup and resting on the frame. This creates the leverge to smoothly and safely pull the bearing cup out of the frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The method is not only less nerve-wracking than using a hammer, it is also non-destructive, meaning the extracted cups stand a lower risk of being damaged and can more easily be reused.

It was something we hadn’t done for a long time, and while I do dislike that the humble walk has had a sexed-up rebrand by the influencers of Instagram and Tiktok – reemerging with requisite filters and hashtags as a ‘hike’ – I was reminded what a fantastic way it is to spend a few hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We got plenty of fresh air, resplendent coastal views, plus a decent workout on the uphills with the breath to chat everywhere else. We even finished in a pub (I said our lifestyle was active, not healthy). In fact, it shares many characteristics with the best bike rides, you just don’t need to invest thousands into equipment or spend 30 minutes-plus shoe-horning on Lycra and pumping up tyres to do it. Just grab your trainers and go.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/odi-performance-bar-tape\">In the Drops: The world’s lightest inner tubes, ODI’s comfiest bar tape, perhaps the best press fit BB extractor around and a good, old-fashioned walk</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Sam Challis &#124; Tech Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"5cb03568dba74431440f7767be10dad0731f403aecac893b2e7f968dbdd569b7","category":"Cycling"}
