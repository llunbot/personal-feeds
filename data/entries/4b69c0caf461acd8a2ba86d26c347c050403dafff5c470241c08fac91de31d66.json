What began as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/windows-11-the-ars-technica-review/\">a more visually cohesive coat of paint</a> for Windows 10 has given way to a user experience that has gradually coasted downhill even as it has picked up new features—a \"clean install\" of the operating system is pretty annoying, at a baseline, even before you consider extra software irritations from your PC, motherboard maker, or Microsoft's all-encompassing push into generative AI.</p>\n<p>We'll never stop asking Microsoft to put out a consumer version of Windows that acts more like the Enterprise versions it gives to businesses, with no extra unasked-for apps and less pushiness about Microsoft's other products and services.

There are plenty of experimental hacks that take it a few steps farther—NTDev's <a href=\"https://github.com/ntdevlabs/tiny11builder\">Tiny11 project</a> is one—but removing built-in Windows components can cause unexpected compatibility and security problems, and Tiny11 has historically had issues with basic table-stakes stuff like \"installing security updates.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b69c0caf461acd8a2ba86d26c347c050403dafff5c470241c08fac91de31d66","category":"Tech"}
