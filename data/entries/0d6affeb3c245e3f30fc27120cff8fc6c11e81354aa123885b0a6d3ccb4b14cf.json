We must strike first.” These comments, supposedly made in 2024, were later interpreted as suggesting NATO should attempt a <a href=\"https://londonlovesbusiness.com/nato-military-chief-warns-we-must-strike-first-in-a-preemptive-attack-against-russia/\">preemptive strike</a> against Russia, an idea that lots of people found outrageously dangerous.</p>\n<p>But lots of people also missed a thing about the quote: Bauer has never said it.
