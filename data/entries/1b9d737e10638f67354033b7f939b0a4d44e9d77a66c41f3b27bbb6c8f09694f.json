In a <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2003/Jun/27/2001713234/-1/-1/1/03-110.pdf\">2003 audit</a>, the DOD's Office of the Inspector General noted, for example, that \"specialized reduction-in-force procedures needed for the National Guard technicians made the module impractical.\" Basically, each department needed to weigh its cuts differently to avoid gutting essential personnel. Despite several software updates since then, Wired <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-autorif-mass-firing-government-workers/\">reported</a>, the tool remained subject to errors, sources told Reuters, requiring most federal agencies to continue conducting firings manually rather than risk work stoppages or other negative outcomes from sloppy firings.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/doge-to-roll-out-shadowy-software-to-speed-mass-govt-layoffs-report-says/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/doge-to-roll-out-shadowy-software-to-speed-mass-govt-layoffs-report-says/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1b9d737e10638f67354033b7f939b0a4d44e9d77a66c41f3b27bbb6c8f09694f","category":"Tech"}
