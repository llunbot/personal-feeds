{"title":"Android Authority Reports Google Has Cancelled the Pixel Tablet 2","link":"https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-tablet-2-canceled-3502094/","date":1732296684000,"content":"\n<p>Mishaal Rahman, reporting yesterday for Android Authority:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Android Authority has learned that Google has canceled the Pixel\nTablet 2, the presumed name of Google’s second-generation Pixel\nTablet. This is disappointing for Pixel fans who were waiting for\nGoogle to refresh its first-generation Pixel Tablet with a newer\nchipset, a better camera, and, more importantly, an official\nkeyboard accessory. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Last week, I shared what I <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-tablet-2-keyboard-3500081/\">learned about the Pixel Tablet\n2</a> from a source within Google. I deemed this source to be\nvery credible given my past history with them as well as the fact\nthat they were able to share unreleased images of the device with\nme (which I obviously did not publish to protect their identity).\nAfter the publication of this article, however, I learned from my\nsource that Google had decided to cancel its plans to release the\ndevice, citing concerns that the company would lose money on it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“Concerns that the company would lose money on it” and <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2024/11/21/pixel-tablet-2-canceled/\">9to5Google’s framing of the same news</a> as “profitability concerns” are fun euphemisms for “no one wants an Android tablet”.</p>\n\n<p>This comes on the heels of <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/19/chromeos-android-merge-maybe\">news just this week</a> that Google is supposedly “fully migrating ChromeOS over to Android” — but somehow not “merging” them — with the specific goal of better competing against the iPad. So a generous read might be that Google is scrapping the Pixel Tablet 2 because that device was planned to run Android (as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23765921/google-pixel-tablet-review\">the existing Pixel Tablet</a> does) but now Google is rejiggering their tablet and laptop hardware roadmaps with the upcoming ChomeOS-migrated-to-not-merged-with-Android OS in mind.</p>\n\n<p>A less generous read is that Google is afflicted with institutional ADHD and generally acts with no apparent strategy. They’ve kept their focus on annual updates to the well-regarded Pixel phones for 8 years now, but haven’t managed to make them hit products. With the rest of their hardware, their strategy has been about as coherent as their <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/\">comically chaotic efforts in messaging apps</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/22/report-google-cancels-pixel-tablet-2\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1ffa1208a492eed4da2307d696135a1318fd85aea5460d946873f8550833cfa2","category":"Tech"}
