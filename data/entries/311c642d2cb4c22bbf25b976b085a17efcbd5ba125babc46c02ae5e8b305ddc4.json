The project has been saddled with delays and now a new rumor claims Apple may have scrapped the whole thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=223278322589&amp;navType=by&amp;xcust=1-1-2157698-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">yeux1122 on Naver</a> (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://m-blog-naver-com.translate.goog/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=223278322589&amp;navType=by&amp;_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&amp;_x_tr_hist=true&amp;xcust=1-1-2157698-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">translation</a>), Apple is “reorganizing its continued investment in its own 5G modem development department and personnel” and ending its plans to bring a 5G model in-house. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/tech_reve/status/1729824690951356893?s=61&amp;t=kRHAVjsvBIeR_t75B6YnpQ&amp;xcust=1-1-2157698-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Revegnus on X</a> (formerly Twitter), also says that Apple has begun “streamlining investments in its 5G modem development division,” but the report comes from the same source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If true, the report represents an ignominious end to a project that has been beset with delays and roadblocks. As recently as last week, it was <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2146450/5g-cellular-connectivity-mac-modem.html\">reported</a> that Apple’s efforts to deliver a 5G modem wouldn’t be ready until at least 2026. That’s following several reported delays to the project, which had an initial target of 2023. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2062572/iphone-qualcomm-5g-modems-through-2026.html\">Qualcomm said in September</a> that it will continue to supply Snapdragon 5G modems for iPhones through at least 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple had a partnership with Intel for a smartphone modem, but that project was dissolved in 2019. After <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233058/apple-intel-mobile-modem-chip-business-purchase.html\">Apple purchased the “majority” of Intel’s modem business</a> for $1 billion, it was believed that Apple would <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1785414/iphone-se-4-canceled-5g-modem-development.html\">deliver its own 5G modem</a> by this year beginning with the iPhone SE 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualcomm currently supplies all of the 5G modems for Android phones and Apple products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Moving the modem in-house would save costs and allow Apple to better control efficiency and heat dissipation. </p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"311c642d2cb4c22bbf25b976b085a17efcbd5ba125babc46c02ae5e8b305ddc4","category":"Apple"}
