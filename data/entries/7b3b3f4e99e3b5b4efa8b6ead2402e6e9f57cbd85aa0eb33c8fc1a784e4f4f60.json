Google introduced Android XR <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/google-android-xr-operating-system/\">late last year</a>. Android XR and Samsung's headset will support being immersed in a virtual environment or staying present in the real world, similar to how Apple allows ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>‌ users to adjust the Vision Pro immersion level by activating or shutting out the real world passthrough view provided by cameras.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/samsung-headset-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1124\" />\r<br />\nThe headset from Samsung will support Google features like Gemini, Google's AI assistant, providing access to device controls and insight into what the wearer is seeing. Samsung has described Project Moohan as \"lightweight\" and \"ergonomically optimized\" for \"maximum comfort,\" but no details on weight are available yet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProject Moohan will be the first headset designed for Android XR, and it is set to launch later in 2025.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/samsung-vr-headset-vision-pro-design/\">Samsung's VR Headset Looks a Lot Like Apple Vision Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsungs-vr-headset-looks-a-lot-like-apple-vision-pro.2447910/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7b3b3f4e99e3b5b4efa8b6ead2402e6e9f57cbd85aa0eb33c8fc1a784e4f4f60","category":"Apple"}
