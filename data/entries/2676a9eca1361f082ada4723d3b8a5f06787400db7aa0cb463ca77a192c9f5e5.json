{"title":"Amazon Layoffs Will Shut Down Camera Review Site DPReview.com After 25 Years","link":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/amazon-layoffs-will-shut-down-camera-review-site-dpreview-com-after-25-years/","date":1679514263000,"content":"\n<p>Andrew Cunningham, reporting for Ars Technica:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Amazon has plans to lay off at least 27,000 workers this year,\nincluding 9,000 that were announced in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/amazon-is-firing-another-9000-workers/\">an internal email Monday\nmorning</a>. One unexpected casualty: Digital Photography\nReview, also known as DPReview, is losing its entire editorial\nstaff, and the site <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/news/5901145460/dpreview-com-to-close\">will stop publishing on April 10</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement post, written by DPReview General Manager Scott\nEverett, says that new pieces will continue to be posted through\nApril 10, and “the site will be locked” afterward. It’s unclear\nwhat will happen to the site’s content afterward — the post\npromises only that the site’s articles “will be available in\nread-only mode for a limited period afterwards.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>Founded in November 1998, DPReview is one of the few active review\nsites as old as Ars Technica. Amazon <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2007/05/amazon-buys-cam/\">purchased it in\n2007</a>, and the site’s team has been located in Amazon’s\nhometown of Seattle since 2010.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The “DP” in “DPReview” stands for “digital photography”. The site is so old that that was necessary, because in 1998 most pro and prosumer photography equipment still revolved around shooting on film. DPReview went all-in on digital photography at a time when many photographers were deeply skeptical of its potential, because the technology was nascent. I’ve bought a fair amount of photography kit over the last 25 years, and never once bought a camera or lens without first reading and watching what DPReview had to say about it. I just bought my first new standalone camera in years a few weeks ago — <a href=\"https://us.ricoh-imaging.com/product/griiix/\">the Ricoh GR IIIx</a> — and <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/videos/5024840309/dpreview-tv-ricoh-gr-iiix-review\">DPReview’s review</a> was the one that sealed the deal for me.</p>\n\n<p>Layoffs are brutal, always, but it feels especially cruel that Amazon is noncommittal regarding keeping DPReview’s content around in perpetuity. Why only keep it available “for a limited time”? How much could it cost to just keep it around forever? Did they even try to sell it? How about letting the staff take over the site as part of their severence?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/22/amazon-layoffs-dpreview\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2676a9eca1361f082ada4723d3b8a5f06787400db7aa0cb463ca77a192c9f5e5","category":"Tech"}
