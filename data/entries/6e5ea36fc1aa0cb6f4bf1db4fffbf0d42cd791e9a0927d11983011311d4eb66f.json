In contrast, Apple Intelligence will be central to the new home accessory, which is actually a \"lower-end companion\" to a $1,000+ robotic device for the home, writes Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSimilar devices have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-smart-home-display/\">rumored for some time</a>. Prototype designs are said to have resembled a HomePod with a screen (magnetically attaching to walls or sitting atop a desk), and an iPad-like display mounted on a robotic arm. Both accessories are said to be collaborations between Apple's AI and home device hardware engineering groups.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBackend code discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> in January suggested that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/tvos-17-4-homeos-mention/\">continuing work on a homeOS platform</a>, as a variant of tvOS. Another code reference finding in June subsequently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/leak-confirms-apples-work-on-home-accessory/\">confirmed</a> the existence of at least one unreleased home accessory.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore recently, <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/26/apples-long-awaited-homeaccessory-could-have-square-display-a18-chip-for-ai-more/\">9to5Mac</a></em> has claimed that the lower-end smart home device features a \"squarish display\", an A18 chip, and a built-in camera for FaceTime. The device apparently supports AirPlay, is able to identify hand gestures from afar, and can tell one person apart from another for personalized requests‌. <em>9to5Mac</em> says Apple could release the home product as early as next spring.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-smart-home-display/\">Apple Smart Home Display</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/30/apple-launch-smart-home-display-next-year/\">Apple May Launch First iPad-Like Smart Home Accessory Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-may-launch-first-ipad-like-smart-home-accessory-next-year.2438633/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6e5ea36fc1aa0cb6f4bf1db4fffbf0d42cd791e9a0927d11983011311d4eb66f","category":"Apple"}
