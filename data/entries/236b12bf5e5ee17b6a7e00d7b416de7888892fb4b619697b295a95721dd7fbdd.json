While <a href=\"https://www.escapistmagazine.com/retro-colored-glasses/\">practically everyone I knew had an NES</a> during my childhood—and a few uncles and friends' older siblings even had an Atari 2600 gathering dust in their dens—I was only vaguely aware of the 7800, Atari's backward compatible, late '80s attempt to maintain relevance in the quickly changing console market.</p>\n<p>Absent that kind of nostalgia, the Atari 7800+ comes across as a real oddity. Fiddling with the system's extremely cumbersome controllers and pixelated, arcade-port-heavy software library from a modern perspective is like peering into a fallen alternate universe, one where Nintendo wasn't able to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/war-stories-how-nintendo-sold-the-nes-to-a-skeptical-country/\">swoop in and revive a flailing Western home video game industry</a> with the NES.</p>\n<p>Even for those with fond memories of Atari 7800-filled childhoods, I'm not sure that this bare-bones package justifies its $130 price. There are many more full-featured ways to get your retro gaming fix, even for those still invested in the tail end of Atari's dead-end branch of the gaming console's evolutionary tree.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/the-atari-7800-is-a-no-frills-glimpse-into-a-forgotten-gaming-era/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/the-atari-7800-is-a-no-frills-glimpse-into-a-forgotten-gaming-era/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"236b12bf5e5ee17b6a7e00d7b416de7888892fb4b619697b295a95721dd7fbdd","category":"Tech"}
