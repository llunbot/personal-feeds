The company has made the widely leaked <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold3-5g/\">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-flip3-5g/\">Galaxy Z Flip 3</a> official.</p>\n<p>First up is the Z Fold 3, Samsung's flagship foldable. The Z Fold 3 is a phone that opens up into a tablet, featuring a 7.6-inch, 2208×1768 flexible OLED display on the inside and a 6.2-inch, 2260×832 OLED display on the outside. The Fold is getting a few big changes this year. First, both screens are 120 Hz. The Fold 2 was 120 Hz on the inside and 60 Hz outside, so the update provides a nice bit of consistency.</p>\n<p>The device sports Samsung's foldable \"Ultra-thin glass\" as a display cover, and there's a layer of protective plastic over top of that. On previous models, the top plastic display surface was subject to scratches and wasn't as friction-free as a real glass smartphone, but the internal layer of ultra-thin glass provides some much-needed rigidity to the plastic display surface. Samsung says it has improved the plastic display cover, which is \"80% more durable\" than previous plastic covers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786155#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786155&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c9748c9bdba3674e5bc2e8e3b2cfafe7303b0124cc2f65d5977fd489b3472aea","category":"Tech"}
