It is unclear when the feature will actually become available in the country.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/sleep-apnea-detection-apple-watch.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThis development comes less than a month after the feature became <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/17/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-brazil/\">available in Brazil</a>, as part of Apple's efforts to roll it out globally. As of September, the notifications were already available in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/16/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-feature-150-countries/\">more than 150 countries and territories</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSleep apnea is a potentially serious disorder in which a person's breathing repeatedly stops and starts while they sleep. The built-in accelerometer on the Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch Series 9, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 running watchOS 11 can \"monitor small movements at the wrist\" that may be associated with breathing disturbances, and notify you if you show consistent signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says the feature was developed using \"advanced machine learning\" and an \"extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests,\" and then validated in a clinical study. It is designed for use by adults without a prior sleep apnea diagnosis.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA log of nightly breathing disturbances can be viewed in the Health app on the iPhone, with each disturbance classified as \"elevated\" or \"not elevated.\"<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/09/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-malaysia-approval/\">Apple Watch's Sleep Apnea Feature Continues to Roll Out Around World</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watchs-sleep-apnea-feature-continues-to-roll-out-around-world.2447064/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3d1ea6b4e8a62e823f6582f5fe8fe85d11cc569bacbb92c458049a28db5629fc","category":"Apple"}
