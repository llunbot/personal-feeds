I have used mine religiously for the past year and a half. I lost one of the legs of my OG Photo Stick, so I picked up a new “minty” fresh one at MADE 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a part of my everyday bike kit. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Easy-Peasy To Pack</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holing-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holing-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Stinner x MADE Photo Stick Purple Rain holing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holing-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holing-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holing-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holing-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holing-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holing-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Photo Stick easily breaks down into three parts, making it very easy to throw in a hip pack, bike bag, or camera bag. Once broken down they end up being a lil’ bigger than a pencil. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-ti-on-ti-action-jpeg-e1732551956446.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"723\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-ti-on-ti-action-jpeg-e1732551956446.webp\" alt=\"2024 Stinner x MADE Photo Stick Purple Rain ti on ti action\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-ti-on-ti-action-jpeg-e1732551956446.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-ti-on-ti-action-jpeg-e1732551956446-297x168.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-ti-on-ti-action-jpeg-e1732551956446-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-ti-on-ti-action-jpeg-e1732551956446-768x434.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Ti on Ti action!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These Photo Sticks are made in-house at Stinner Frameworks in Santa Barbara, California. The pieces are chased and welded with bottle bosses, making it easy to assemble and disassemble. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holding-it-up-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holding-it-up-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Stinner x MADE Photo Stick Purple Rain holding it up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holding-it-up-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holding-it-up-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holding-it-up-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holding-it-up-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holding-it-up-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-holding-it-up-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Purple Rainin’</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo Sticks are painted in-house as well, by Good Color Studio. Rubberized ends to add the right amount of grip. They are pretty enough to leave in the shot, or Photoshop it out for that perfect, pro-like “floating bike” photo. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-titanium-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-titanium-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Stinner x MADE Photo Stick Purple Rain titanium\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-titanium-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-titanium-297x232.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-titanium-120x94.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Stinner-x-MADE-Photo-Stick-Purple-Rain-titanium-768x600.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To assemble, you simply screw the three pieces together and place them on the non-drive side of your steed. I use it in the center hole of my crank arm. To disassemble, just unscrew the pieces and store them away, ready for the next photo op later down the trail. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Photo Stick Retail and Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $60 (steel), $80 (titanium)</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Crafted from Steel/Titanium by Stinner Frameworks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Painted by Good Color Studio</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Available in Steel (Black, Purple Rain) or Raw Titanium</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MADE x Stinner Logo</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Collapsible and Packable</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Made in the USA</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Go ahead, get your own at the link below, and take your bike photos to the next level!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stinnerframeworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">StinnerFrameworks.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/stinner-x-made-photo-stick-purple-rain/\">The Stinner X MADE Photo Stick Now in Purple Rain is a Great Stocking Stuffer</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0585ba00cea83859c03a6f9ad73a5f256544a0c51d06b15875560cd9ca5441e7","category":"Cycling"}
