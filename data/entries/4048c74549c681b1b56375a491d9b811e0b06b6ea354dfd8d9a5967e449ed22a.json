With this victory, Pogačar becomes the youngest rider to ever win three Tours de France. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the race, we broke down <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-prize-money\" target=\"_blank\">all the figures behind the Tour de France’s €2.282 million prize pot</a>, with insight into how much each classification provides. Now it’s all been divvied out, we delve into the Tour’s big money questions. How much did Tadej Pogačar win at the Tour de France? Which teams brought home big bucks despite a small budget? And, who flopped despite having a €50 million team budget?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, bear in mind that prize money is usually split among the whole team, both riders and staff. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Tadej Pogačar secures an estimated total of €650,000</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-970x647.png\" alt=\"tadej pogacar colnago v4rs money cost\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T121154.049.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no prizes for guessing that Tadej Pogačar picked up the most prize money at the 2024 Tour de France. His haul is headlined by the €500,000 cheque given for the overall win. This is equivalent to 70,000 Big Macs, 170 bottles of Chateau Pétrus, the world’s most expensive wine or 31 full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tadej-pogacar-colnago-v4rs-tour-de-france-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Colnago V4Rs</a> bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On his way to overall glory, Pogačar picked up some neat bonuses. The 25-year-old won €66,000 for his six stage wins, plus the daily amounts awarded for wearing the yellow jersey (€9,000 throughout the race), and a healthy five-figure tally for his stage placings. In total, he earned the team approximately €650,000 by our estimations. This is the most he has ever earned at a single Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second most lucrative rider at the Tour in terms of prize money is Visma-Lease a Bike’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Vingegaard</a>. The Dane clocked up an estimated total of around €250,000, including the €200,000 earned for finishing as the runner-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best young rider, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a>, finished in third place overall at the 2024 Tour de France. In total, he comes out as the third highest prize money scorer at the 2024 race. We estimate that Evenepoel’s winnings, including €100,000 for finishing on the podium, round out to approximately €170,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/biniam-girmay-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Biniam Girmay</a>, the green jersey winner, clocked up a prize money haul of somewhere around €85,000-€90,000. He is the fourth biggest earner from the Tour.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-breakaways\">Is this the end of Tour de France breakaways?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-predictions-2024\">Cyclist’s Tour de France predictions 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-sponsors\">Who actually are the Tour de France team sponsors 2024?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-prize-money\">How much is the 2024 Tour de France prize money?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>UAE Team Emirates on top alongside GC giants</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120835.090-970x647.png\" alt=\"tadej poagacr and uae team emiarets tour de france stage 21 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120835.090-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120835.090-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120835.090-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120835.090-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120835.090-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120835.090-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120835.090-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120835.090-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120835.090-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120835.090.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To no one’s surprise, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a> take home the biggest cheque from this Tour de France. In total, Pogačar’s team raked in €806,810. The team, who filled three spots in the top ten of GC, also took home the team classification prize worth €50,000, plus Pogačar’s six stage wins. In total, UAE Team Emirates won 35.3% of the total prize money on offer at this year’s Tour. For context, this is a larger prize pool than <a href=\"https://x.com/inrng/status/1551470043740921857\" target=\"_blank\">Jumbo-Visma’s €779,750 won</a> during their barnstorming 2022 Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the prize money podium comprises the rest of the GC podium teams. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/visma-lease-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Visma-Lease a Bike</a> took home the second largest amount of prize money on €356,220 – 44% of UAE’s total winnings. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/soudal-quickstep\" target=\"_blank\">Soudal-QuickStep</a> received €248,860, including the €20,000 awarded for Evenepoel’s white jersey victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intermarché-Wanty were the Tour’s overachievers, finishing in fourth place in the team prize money standings. With a total prize pot of €111,760, the Belgian team were the highest non-GC team on the list. This is mainly due to Girmay’s green jersey win and his three stage wins. However, Mike Teunissen’s €3,000 prize for being the best teammate of the second week can also be added into the mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>EF Education-EasyPost salvaged their Tour de France balance sheet in the final week of the race. Richard Carapaz’s stage win in SuperDévoluy, his late raid on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fix-king-of-the-mountains-polka-dot-jersey-tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">the polka dot jersey</a> and his super combative prize brought the American team’s total to a healthy €90,210.

If the budget is bigger as a result of this, their last place will only be amplified.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-breakaways\">Is this the end of Tour de France breakaways?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-predictions-2024\">Cyclist’s Tour de France predictions 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-sponsors\">Who actually are the Tour de France team sponsors 2024?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-prize-money\">How much is the 2024 Tour de France prize money?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/prize-money-2024-tour-de-france\">Who won the most prize money at the 2024 Tour de France?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"4048c74549c681b1b56375a491d9b811e0b06b6ea354dfd8d9a5967e449ed22a","category":"Cycling"}
