Apple's least-expensive Mac, the mini, is being updated with new M4 processors, plus a smaller design that looks like a cross between an Apple TV box and a Mac Studio—this is the mini's first major design change since <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/112588\">the original aluminum version</a> was released in 2010. The mini is also Apple's first device to ship with the M4 Pro processor, a beefed-up version of the M4 with more CPU and GPU cores, and it's also the Mac mini's first update since <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/m2-pro-mac-mini-review-apples-goldilocks-desktop-for-semi-professionals/\">the M2 models came out in early 2023</a>.</p>\n<p>The cheapest Mac mini will still run you $599, which includes 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage; as with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/apples-1299-m4-imac-at-long-last-bumps-the-base-model-to-16gb-of-ram/\">yesterday's iMac update</a>, this is the first time since 2012 that Apple has boosted the amount of RAM in an entry-level Mac. It's a welcome upgrade for every new Mac in the lineup that's getting it, but the $200 that Apple previously charged for the 16GB upgrade makes an even bigger difference to someone shopping for a $599 system than it does for someone who can afford a $999 or $1,299 computer.</p>\n<p>The M4 Pro Mac mini starts at $1,399, a $100 increase from the M2 Pro version. Both models <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini\">go up for preorder today</a> and will begin arriving on November 8.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/apples-first-mac-mini-redesign-in-14-years-looks-like-a-big-aluminum-apple-tv/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/10/apples-first-mac-mini-redesign-in-14-years-looks-like-a-big-aluminum-apple-tv/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f57b0c278bc7a1a7dfaf37566f7caed107074b89a689d4e8129d865ea6d790df","category":"Tech"}
