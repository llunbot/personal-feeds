But this week is different. Aside from two more missions carrying Starlink satellites, SpaceX is preparing to send a four-person crew to the International Space Station early Friday.</p>\n<p>The crew launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida will deliver NASA commander Jasmin Moghbeli, European Space Agency astronaut Andreas Mogensen, Japanese astronaut Satoshi Furukawa, and Russian cosmonaut Konstantin Borisov to the space station for a half-year stay. This mission, known as Crew-7, will be SpaceX's 11th astronaut flight and the company's seventh operational crew rotation mission for NASA using a Crew Dragon spacecraft.</p>\n<p>Bill Gerstenmaier, SpaceX's vice president of build and flight reliability, says these crew missions are special. SpaceX and NASA managers met Monday for a flight readiness review, a customary milestone before every crew launch, to deliberate on any problems that could affect the upcoming mission.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962279#p3\">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962279&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"192167859a392ef1c3a4f3e824c736b82aafd1174ab543a4f39c5a968916a0be","category":"Tech"}
