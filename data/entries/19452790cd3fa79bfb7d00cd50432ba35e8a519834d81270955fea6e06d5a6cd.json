That's according to the Weibo-based leaker Fixed Focus Digital. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-17-Pro-Dual-Tone-Rectangle-Slimmer-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn a post on Monday, the Chinese leaker <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5821279480/P8hITmmjN\">claimed</a> that suppliers say the iPhone 17 is adopting a \"process overhaul,\" suggesting that Apple has developed new manufacturing techniques to create smoother transitions between different materials. \"The key point is that the connection area between the body's deco [camera bump] and the back cover is a slope rather than a step,\" said the leaker, based on a machine translation. The \"slope\" likely refers to the smooth aesthetic transition between the camera bump and the rear â€“ or where the protruding aluminum lens module meets the back cover. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, Apple is allegedly planning to eliminate the titanium frame, instead <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/\">going back to aluminum</a>. Along with an aluminum frame, the iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to include a half-aluminum, half-glass backing, rather than an all-glass back. The top half of the back will be made from aluminum, while the bottom half will continue to be made from glass to support wireless charging functionality. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear whether Fixed Focus Digital is referring specifically to the iPhone 17 Pro models or the iPhone 17 series per se. Less is known about the design of the standard iPhone 17 model, while the Plus model is expected to be replaced by an iPhone 17 \"Air\" featuring a completely <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/iphone-17-air-2mm-thinner/\">new slimmer design</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the iPhone 17 Pro models, Apple is also believed to be planning for a larger \"rectangular\" camera bump that is made from aluminum rather than glass. Supply chain leaks have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/iphone-17-pro-redesign-backed-by-supply-chain-info/\">backed up</a> a report by <em>The Information</em> about a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/\">camera design change</a>. Leaks coming out of China suggest that the module is an \"elongated oval shape,\" rather than a rectangular shape. The iPhone 17 series is expected to arrive around the usual mid-September time frame.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast week, the account Fixed Focus Digital claimed that the fourth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/01/iphone-se-4-rumored-to-be-named-iphone-16e/\">iPhone SE will be named the iPhone 16E</a>, echoing claims from other sources. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/\">Fixed Focus Digital</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/iphone-17-design-smoother-edge-to-back/\">iPhone 17 Said to Feature More Seamless Camera Bump Design</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-said-to-feature-more-seamless-camera-bump-design.2446775/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"19452790cd3fa79bfb7d00cd50432ba35e8a519834d81270955fea6e06d5a6cd","category":"Apple"}
