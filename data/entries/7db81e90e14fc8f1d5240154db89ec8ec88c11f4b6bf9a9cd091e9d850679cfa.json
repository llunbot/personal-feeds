Battery health remains at 100 percent at 101 cycles and battery life has been impressive, but this is the ‌iPhone 16‌ with the biggest battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCamera Control has been a hit or miss feature. It's useful for opening the camera quickly to snap photos, but digging into the extra menus with swipes and gestures is clunky and takes too long.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> is about the same, and it's not always super useful. One of the better features is Clean Up, which removes unwanted images from photos. Clean Up has improved over time since it was first introduced in iOS 18.1, and it's more useful than it was initially. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a> is fun, but it needs improvement because a lot of simple requests just don't pan out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnsurprisingly, the camera has been great, especially the improved 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens that Apple added. Photographic Styles adds useful customization options, and it's easier to make quick edits that give your images a uniform look.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHave an ‌iPhone 16‌?
