They chose from a list made up of the companies that ranked in the top 25% in last yearâ€™s surveys, plus those that finished in the top 20% of their industry. Anyone could vote for any company in any industry.</blockquote>To see the full ranking of the World's Most Admired Companies, visit <a href=\"https://fortune.com/ranking/worlds-most-admired-companies/\"><em>Fortune</em>'s website</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fortune-com/\">Fortune</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-most-admired-company-17th-year/\">Apple Tops 'World's Most Admired Company' List for 17th Consecutive Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tops-worlds-most-admired-company-list-for-17th-consecutive-year.2418046/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ee3568ab1248c93e0240372058caeee6ba642a958f716b97ece5f9ab68f8e2ce","category":"Apple"}
