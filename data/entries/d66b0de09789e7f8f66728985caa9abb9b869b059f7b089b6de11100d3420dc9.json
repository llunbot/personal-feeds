In the last decade, Apple has had major media events in six Octobers, and we expect this year will be the seventh as Apple gears up to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1064916/apple-october-event-date-time-mac-ipad.html\">announce new Macs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s not just about new hardware. For years, Apple’s big operating system releases have come in September but with a few missing features that roll out in later updates, and October is when we expect the first one. This year that is especially relevant, as iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 will deliver the first <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369986/apple-intelligence-siri-features-coming-after-ios-18-launch.html\">Apple Intelligence features</a>. Here’s everything we expect in a busy month from Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Apple hasn’t announced it yet, we expect an event in October to announce new M4-based Macs. It’s always possible that these Macs will be released directly to the web without a special event, though rumors suggest there are more than enough new products for a keynote:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A new Mac mini:</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">Mac mini</a> is due for its first <em>real</em> design change since the introduction of the unibody aluminum Mac mini in 2010. It is expected to be a lot smaller, though perhaps a little taller. Think of it more like a big Apple TV than its current frame that measures nearly 8 by 8 inches. The new Mac mini should be available with M4 and M4 Pro processors, front-facing USB-C ports, and possibly no more USB-A ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>M4 MacBook Pros:</strong> We’re expecting <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303108/m4-macbook-pro-release-date-price-specs-rumors.html\">updates to the MacBook Pro</a> to feature the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. It’s basically a processor upgrade from the M3 MacBook Pro line of today, but the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2472373/m4-macbook-pro-leak-reveals-key-upgrades-coming-to-base-model.html\">entry-level model</a> could get a RAM boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mac Studio with M4 Max and M4 Ultra:</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2204696/m3-mac-studio-design-processor-specs-price.html\">Mac Studio</a> is still languishing back on the M2 generation, so it’s in desperate need of an update. We haven’t heard to expect one, tough…the latest rumor for says it won’t be coming until 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mac Pro: </strong>This is another Mac that never even got an M3 version, but like the Mac Studio we don’t think Apple will update the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320613/m3-m4-ultra-mac-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html\">Mac Pro</a> until 2025 when an M4 Ultra is available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Updated iPads:</strong> Apple updates some of its iPads on an almost yearly basis, and we think they’ll introduce the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2024-release-date.html\">11th-gen iPad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">7th-gen iPad mini</a>, both with the A17 Pro processor or possibly an A18. It would be a misstep for Apple to use an earlier processor that does not support Apple Intelligence, so we expect 8GB of RAM on board too.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Find out <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products.html\">what else might be coming from Apple in 2024 and 2025</a>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is promoting the latest iPhones with Apple Intelligence as a major selling point, but Apple Intelligence is not yet available. The first update to add some AI features will come in October, and Apple is likely to begin testing the iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS 15.2 updates that add even more features before they are released later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS and iPadOS 18.1:</strong> Along with a few other tweaks, this update brings the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2412089/ios-18-1-beta-release-date-apple-intelligence.html\">first Apple Intelligence features</a>, including Writing Tools, notification and email summaries, and Siri improvements that include more resilient prompts and a new edge-glow interface. We may see the introduction of the new AirPods Pro hearing features with iOS 18.1, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS Sequoia 15.1:</strong> That first tranche of Apple Intelligence features comes to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS Sequoia</a> at the same time, but so does another nice upgrade—drag-and-drop support when using iPhone Mirroring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in TK.
