That production rate would only be about 4 percent faster than the roughly 44,000 units per day Sony shipped on average in the system's first 7.5 months on the market. That's despite <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/chip-shortage-may-threaten-playstation-5-supplies-at-christmas/\">a February statement from Sony Interactive Entertainment President Jim Ryan</a> suggesting that supply chain improvements would mean \"by the time we get to the second half of [2021], you’re going to be seeing really decent [PS5 production] numbers indeed.\"</p>\n<h2>Are shortages here to stay?</h2>\n<p>The modest increase in PS5 production in the coming months likely won't be enough to put a dent in widespread PS5 shortages, which are causing units of the system to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ps5stockalerts\">sell out almost immediately</a> when they hit retail shelves. But Totoki's new statement suggests those shortages are driven more by intense demand than by Sony's inability to secure the chips it feels it needs in the near term (and while scalpers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/scalpers-arent-the-main-reason-you-cant-find-a-new-console/\">certainly aren't helping</a> that situation, healthy demand from consumers seems to be driving the market in total).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785085#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785085&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c8b87837e2fe63f778ea5dabf6c110491231088dfd211f0f93fb057211172b4f","category":"Tech"}
