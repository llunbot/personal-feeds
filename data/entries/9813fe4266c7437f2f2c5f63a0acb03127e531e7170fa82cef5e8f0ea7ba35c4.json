The <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y9ef7wwd\" target=\"_blank\">Surface Laptop Go 3</a> and the Surface Go 4 are externally identical to their predecessors, but both are getting respectable internal upgrades that should provide enough power for budget-minded PC buyers. But only the laptop will be available to the general public; the new Go tablet will only be offered to Microsoft's business customers.</p>\n\n    <div>\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                <h3>Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 3                                                </h3>\n                        <div>\n                                                            <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y9ef7wwd\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                    From $800 at Microsoft                                </a>\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                                <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y9ef7wwd\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <div>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<p>The Laptop Go 3 is getting a new higher starting price of <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y9ef7wwd\" target=\"_blank\">$800</a>, which is $200 higher than the starting price of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/review-microsofts-surface-laptop-go-2-has-a-lot-of-problems-but-i-like-it-anyway/\">Laptop Go 2</a>. That said, the $600 configuration of the Laptop Go 2 was essentially impossible to recommend, thanks to its 128GB SSD and (especially) its paltry 4GB of RAM. The new base config comes with a serviceable 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD, with a 16GB RAM upgrade available for another $200. These upgrade prices are steep and arguably take the Go out of the \"budget laptop\" category, but they do have the benefit of making it much more usable, and the laptop costs the same amount as the 8GB/256GB version of the Laptop Go 2.</p>\n<p>The Laptop Go 3 is available for preorder now in four different colors and will launch on October 3.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969999#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969999&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9813fe4266c7437f2f2c5f63a0acb03127e531e7170fa82cef5e8f0ea7ba35c4","category":"Tech"}
