Well, one of Google's biggest rivals, OpenAI's ChatGPT, is apparently coming for the premium phone space occupied by Google's voice assistant. Mishaal Rahman at <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/chatgpt-replace-google-assistant-3399920/\">Android Authority</a> found that the ChatGPT app is working on support for Android's voice assistant APIs and a system-wide overlay UI. If the company rolls out this feature, users could set the ChatGPT app as the system-wide assistant app, allowing it to pop up anywhere in Android and respond to user questions. ChatGPT started as a text-only generative AI but received <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/chatgpt-goes-multimodal-with-image-recognition-and-speech-synthesis/\">voice and image input capabilities</a> in September.</p>\n<p>Usually, it's the Google Assistant with system-wide availability in Android, but that's not special home cooking from Googleâ€”it all happens via public APIs that technically any app can plug into. You can only have one app enabled as the system-wide \"Default Assistant App,\" and beyond the initial setting, the user always has to change it manually. The assistant APIs are designed to be powerful, keeping some parts of the app running 24/7 no matter where you are. Being the default Assistant app enables launching the app via the power button or a gesture, and the assist app can read the current screen text and images for processing.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"The Default Assistant App settings. \" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-980x1057.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-scaled.jpg\">The Default Assistant App settings. </a> (credit: Ron Amadeo)</p></div>\n<p>If some Android manufacturer signed a deal with ChatGPT and included it as a bundled system application, ChatGPT could even use an always-on voice hotword, where saying something like \"Hey, ChatGPT\" would launch the app even when the screen is off. System apps get more permissions than normal apps, though, and an always-on hotword is locked behind these system app permissions, so ChatGPT would need to sign a distribution deal with some Android manufacturer. Given the red-hot popularity of ChatGPT, though, I'm sure a few would sign up if it were offered.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993933#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993933&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"40661f1d75a29d1e07d3c5d282385506dcabe4ca2477f3aaecb33b34796b090d","category":"Tech"}
