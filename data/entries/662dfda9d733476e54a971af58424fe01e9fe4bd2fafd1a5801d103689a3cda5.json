Also known as the Ivanti EPM, the software runs on a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome OS, and Internet of Things devices such as routers. SQL injection vulnerabilities stem from faulty code that interprets user input as database commands or, in more technical terms, from concatenating data with SQL code without quoting the data in accordance with the SQL syntax. CVE-2023-39336, as the Ivanti vulnerability is tracked, carries a severity rating of 9.6 out of a possible 10.</p>\n<p>“If exploited, an attacker with access to the internal network can leverage an unspecified SQL injection to execute arbitrary SQL queries and retrieve output without the need for authentication,” Ivanti officials wrote Friday in a <a href=\"https://www.ivanti.com/blog/security-update-for-ivanti-epm\">post</a> announcing the patch availability. “This can then allow the attacker control over machines running the EPM agent. When the core server is configured to use SQL express, this might lead to RCE on the core server.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994088#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994088&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"662dfda9d733476e54a971af58424fe01e9fe4bd2fafd1a5801d103689a3cda5","category":"Tech"}
