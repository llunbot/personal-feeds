This eliminates metal-on-metal contact, corrosion, and creaking.

The system of a spindle O-ring, seals on the bearing/bushing gutter, inner low-contact &amp; outer bearing races, shell O-rings, and a labyrinth-style end cap seal “ensures smooth spinning in sunshine, rain, snow, and mud alike”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wolf Tooth sent over one of their new orange T47 bottom bracket for my upcoming Scarab Cycles Darién build!

(Photo / Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A No Creaking Promise</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wolf Tooth claims there’ll be no creaking from these bottom brackets. The reason is that custom bushings separate the bearing inner race and crank spindle to eliminate any metal-on-metal contact, which is the leading cause of BB creaks. This bushing will also help enhance bearing longevity with a mating interface to the bearing gutter seal for maximum weatherproofing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-components-bottom-bracket.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-components-bottom-bracket.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-components-bottom-bracket.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-components-bottom-bracket-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-components-bottom-bracket-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-components-bottom-bracket-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-components-bottom-bracket-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-components-bottom-bracket-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-components-bottom-bracket-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wolf-Tooth-components-bottom-bracket-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They are also available in several colors to help you get matchy-matchy with all of your other Wolf Tooth anodized bits.
