{"title":"The Downfall of Brydge","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/04/brydge-keyboards-out-of-business-update/","date":1683316445000,"content":"\n<p>Chance Miller, reporting for 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Brydge, a once thriving startup making popular keyboard\naccessories for iPad, Mac, and Microsoft Surface products, is\nceasing operations. According to nearly a dozen former Brydge\nemployees who spoke to <em>9to5Mac</em> , Brydge has gone through\nmultiple rounds of layoffs within the past year after at least two\nfailed acquisitions.</p>\n\n<p>As it stands today, Brydge employees have not been paid salaries\nsince January. Customers who pre-ordered the company’s most recent\nproduct have been left in the dark since then as well. Its website\nwent <a href=\"https://www.brydge.com/\">completely offline</a> earlier this year, and its social\nmedia accounts have been silent since then as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The whole report is a hell of a read. Impressive original reporting from Miller and his colleagues at 9to5Mac. Here’s just one gut punch among many in the story:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In December, Brydge held its annual Christmas party at a local\nrestaurant. [Co-CEOs] Mander-Jones and Smith had set a budget for the party,\nthe people said, and they stuck to that budget. At the end of the\nnight, one of the CEOs put his card down for the bill. His card\nwas declined, and a Brydge employee paid the bill instead, the\npeople said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/05/downfall-of-brydge\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6f5e1bd501e251be401f6509861ee303a5d6533a4cacd40f1567948571073e01","category":"Tech"}
