Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the CEO of Novo Nordisk will testify before lawmakers later this year on the \"outrageously high cost\" of the company's diabetes and weight-loss drugs—Ozempic and Wegovy—in the US.</p>\n<p>CEO Lars Jørgensen <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-announces-ceo-of-novo-nordisk-to-voluntarily-testify-before-help-committee/\">will appear</a> before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), which is chaired by Sanders, in early September. The agreement came after a conversation with Sanders in which the CEO reportedly \"reconsidered his position\" and agreed to testify voluntarily. As such, Sanders has canceled a vote scheduled for <a href=\"https://www.help.senate.gov/chair/newsroom/press/news-chairman-sanders-announces-help-committee-vote-to-subpoena-novo-nordisk-inc-president\">June 18 on whether to subpoena Novo Nordisk</a> to discuss its US prices, which are considerably higher than those of other countries.</p>\n<p>The independent lawmaker has been working for months to pressure Novo Nordisk into lowering its prices and appearing before the committee. In April, Sanders <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Letter-from-Sen.-Bernard-Sanders-to-Novo-Nordisk.pdf\">sent Jørgensen a letter</a> announcing an investigation into the prices and included a lengthy set of information requests. In May, the committee's investigation released a report suggesting that Novo Nordisk's current pricing threatens to \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/outrageously-priced-weight-loss-drugs-could-bankrupt-us-health-care/\">bankrupt our entire health care system</a>.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032005#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032005&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e8431d5609c068864d4197aaed8827c34144e4039f58bec5dcc9390f11b15e1c","category":"Tech"}
