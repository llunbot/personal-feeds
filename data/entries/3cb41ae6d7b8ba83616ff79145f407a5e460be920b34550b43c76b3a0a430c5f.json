Following the trends of Apple's chip identifiers, the latest discoveries are believed to correspond to the \"A19,\" \"M5 Pro,\" \"M5 Max,\" and \"M5 Ultra\" chips, suggesting that work on these processors is underway.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's Tatsu Signing Server (TSS) verifies firmware files by issuing unique certificates called APTickets, which contain specific details, with no third-party logs. In an effort to identify unreleased ApChipIDs, TSS requests were made for every possible identifier. Those that did not return an invalid identifier seemingly point to an unreleased chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAmong the discovered ApChipIDs, the identifier 0x8150 is believed to correspond to the A19, while 0x6050, 0x6051, and 0x6052 are believed to represent the M5 Pro, M5 Max, and M5 Ultra, respectively. This inference is made based on the logical sequence and patterns of previously released chips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAssuming that Apple continues to release new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models every year, the A19 could debut in 2025's ‌iPhone‌ 17 Pro models. For now, Apple's first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a> chip, the A17 Bionic, is believed to be just weeks away from announcement in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, sporting major performance and efficiency improvements over all of the Apple silicon chips from recent years that are based on TSMC's 5nm process.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/a19-and-m5-chips-discovered/\">'A19' and 'M5' Chips Discovered on Apple Backend Server</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/a19-and-m5-chips-discovered-on-apple-backend-server.2399210/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3cb41ae6d7b8ba83616ff79145f407a5e460be920b34550b43c76b3a0a430c5f","category":"Apple"}
