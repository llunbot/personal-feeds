{"title":"Playdate Delayed Until Early 2022","link":"https://lists.play.date/w/C1CCc0cxLPvgKc6tC8jVmg","date":1636832213000,"content":"\n<p>Panic, in an update to those who’ve pre-ordered the Playdate:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And so, we shipped 5,000 finished Playdates <em>back</em> to Malaysia to\nbe given new batteries. How did that feel? Not great!!!</p>\n\n<p>The good news: we’ve already received the new batteries from the\nnew supplier, and they’re looking really impressive — they’re\nexactly what we’re hoping for, if not even better than before.\nWe’re extremely confident the new supplier can give Playdate the\nbattery life we designed, and you deserve.</p>\n\n<p>And there’s one huge silver lining: we’re extremely glad that we\nfound this potential issue <em>before</em> shipping you a Playdate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With lots of pre-orders in place, we immediately placed an order\nat our factory for all the parts needed for 2022 units and beyond.\nThe response was… sobering. Many of our parts have been delayed\nsignificantly. In fact, we can’t get any more of Playdate’s\ncurrent CPU for — you’re not going to believe this — two years.\nLike, 730 days.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you’ve heard about the “global chip shortage” everyone’s\ntalking about? We’re here to say it is very real. Covid-19 caused\nan ever-cascading set of worldwide supply chain failures that are\nleading to many, many electronic parts being simply… gone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The good news on that front is that they’ve already designed a new logic board using a different, but equivalent, CPU that <em>is</em> available. More good news: the Playdate SDKs (there are two — the full SDK using C and Lua, and a web-based graphical you-don’t-even-have-to-be-a-programmer-to-make-a-game tool called Pulp) are close to shipping.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, shipping any project is hard. Shipping hardware is <em>really</em> hard. And shipping hardware amidst this pandemic-induced global supply chain fiasco is just crazy hard. Valve’s Steam Deck — sort of the anti-Playdate — <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/22774884/steam-deck-valve-delay-handheld-pc-feb-2022\">is delayed into early 2022 too</a>, and both Sony and Nintendo <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/nintendo-cuts-switch-sales-forecast-on-chip-shortage.html\">have cut production estimates</a> for the PlayStation 5 and Switch consoles.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/13/playdate-delayed-until-early-2022\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"22a9c255941dd1e2eea4d1309d78e180f1b427d5ddba9a1bfb315136ee2921e7","category":"Tech"}
