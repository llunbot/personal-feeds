However, <a href=\"https://api.starlink.com/public-files/Commitment%20to%20Space%20Sustainability.pdf\">in a statement</a>, the company said, \"The Starlink team identified a common issue in this small population of satellites that could increase the probability of failure in the future.\"</p>\n<p>This only represents a small fraction of the Starlink megaconstellation, which SpaceX has been launching on Falcon 9 rockets over the last half-decade. To date, SpaceX has put nearly 6,000 satellites into orbit a few hundred kilometers above the planet. This rapid growth in the company's constellation has raised widespread concerns about the cluttering of low-Earth orbit and the potential for a profusion of debris.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003729#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003729&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1a076048ab9c7d079db24173e6e846b4eccc019b2c10bfdf2b0a42a89b8280d2","category":"Tech"}
