{"title":"Nate Silver on the Demise of FiveThirtyEight","link":"https://www.natesilver.net/p/a-few-words-about-fivethirtyeight","date":1741281266000,"content":"\n<p>Nate Silver, writing at his Silver Bulletin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Last night, as President Trump delivered his State of the Union\naddress, the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-to-cut-nearly-6-staff-across-abc-news-disney-entertainment-networks-8af04b40\">reported</a> that ABC News would\nlay off the remaining staff at 538 as part of broader cuts within\ncorporate parent Disney. Having been through several rounds of\nthis before, including <a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/some-personal-news\">two years ago</a> when the staff was cut by\nmore than half and my tenure expired too, I know it’s a brutal\nprocess for everyone involved. It’s also tough being in a business\nwhile having a constant anvil over your head, as we had in pretty\nmuch every odd-numbered (non-election) year from 2017 onward at\n538/FiveThirtyEight. I don’t know all of the staffers from the\nmost recent iteration of the site, but the ones I have met or who\nI overlapped with are all extremely conscientious and hard-working\npeople and were often forced to work double-duty as jobs were cut\nbut frequently not replaced. My heart goes out to them, and I’m\nhappy to provide recommendations for people I worked with there.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that, I wasn’t inclined to say too much more, but it felt\nweirder not to say anything at all. And it’s easier to say\nsomething here than filter it through a reporter or something.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/06/silver-fivethirtyeight\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"80228517ce845e2c50c678fa6a38df461d805f7ad2a8d5cd408965dead49d512","category":"Tech"}
