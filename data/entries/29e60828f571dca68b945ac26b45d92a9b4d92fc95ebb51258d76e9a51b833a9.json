In internal testing, Apple has found that heart rate data is \"more accurate\" on the Apple Watch compared to AirPods, but he said the AirPods \"aren't terribly far off.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/06/what-to-expect-from-powerbeats-pro-2/\">upcoming Powerbeats Pro 2 will also offer heart rate monitoring</a> during workouts. Based on our iOS 18 code findings, you will be able to connect the Powerbeats Pro 2 to gym equipment like a treadmill to measure heart rate, and the data will be visible in the Health app and other supported apps on the iPhone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple previously announced that the Powerbeats Pro 2 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/04/beats-teases-powerbeats-pro-2/\">will be released in 2025</a>, but it is not entirely clear when the AirPods Pro 3 will launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs a longer-term goal, Gurman reiterated that Apple plans to add small cameras to future AirPods to enable unspecified AI-powered features. This project is now a \"priority\" for Apple, but likely still a few years away from completion, he said.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/22/airpods-pro-3-heart-rate-feature-rumor/\">Apple Reportedly Working on AirPods Pro 3 With Heart Rate Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-working-on-airpods-pro-3-with-heart-rate-feature.2445925/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"29e60828f571dca68b945ac26b45d92a9b4d92fc95ebb51258d76e9a51b833a9","category":"Apple"}
