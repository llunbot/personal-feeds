That's according to July's numbers from <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/xiaomi-becomes-1-smartphone-brand-globally-first-time-ever/\">Counterpoint Research</a>, which has Xiaomi in first with 17.1 percent of the global market, Samsung in second with 15.7 percent, and Apple in third with 14.3 percent.</p>\n<p>Counterpoint says Xiaomi's market share grew 26 percent month-over-month. Counterpoint Research Director Tarun Pathak explains why, saying, “Ever since the decline of Huawei commenced, Xiaomi has been making consistent and aggressive efforts to fill the gap created by this decline. The OEM has been expanding in Huawei’s and HONOR’s legacy markets like China, Europe, Middle East, and Africa. In June, Xiaomi was further helped by China, Europe, and India’s recovery and Samsung’s decline due to supply constraints.”</p>\n<p>Huawei <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/huaweis-phone-sales-plummet-42-percent-in-q4-2020-its-now-in-sixth-place/\">has been plummeting</a> in the market share charts as the effects of the multi-year US export ban caught up with the company.
