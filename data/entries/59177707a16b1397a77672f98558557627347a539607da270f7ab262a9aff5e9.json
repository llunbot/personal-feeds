It reckons that the bike is also a good tool for smoother ultra-MTB races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It suggests that you can either see the Ignite GTX as a more capable gravel bike or a faster mountain bike and aims to provide a turnkey solution for riders who would otherwise custom build their own alpine gravel bike. Ridley suggests that the Ignite GTX is a good option for races and bikepacking routes such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/atlas-mountain-race\">Atlas Mountain Race</a>, the Great Divide and the Trascordilleras.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ridley already has an Ignite in its range, but that’s a hardtail XC MTB. The Ignite GTX gravel bike shares much of that bike’s geometry, with flex stays to increase comfort and a slacker 70 degree head tube angle to add stability, although even that’s not as slack as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/argonaut-supernaut-gr3-review\">Argonaut Supernaut GR3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s MTB-like tyre clearance too: 2.3 inches. That’s 58mm for non-mountain bikers. Ridley says that wider tyres lead to lower resistance and a reduced risk of flats, although they ride slower. But add in drop bars and the rider can get more aero, while it says that the lower speeds in these more technical races make highly tuned aerodynamics less critical than in many gravel races, where the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-race-bikes\">best gravel racing bikes</a> are increasingly aero tuned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-bike-geometry-handling\">geometry </a>includes a longer wheelbase to add stability, a higher bottom bracket to improve obstacle clearance and a higher stack for a more comfortable ride position. It’s designed to allow the use of a suspension fork.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+2\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-2-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>And monster crosser spec</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"730\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ridley-Ignite-GTX-3-730x970.webp\" alt=\"Ridley Ignite GTX\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ridley-Ignite-GTX-3-730x970.webp 730w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ridley-Ignite-GTX-3-226x300.webp 226w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ridley-Ignite-GTX-3-768x1020.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ridley-Ignite-GTX-3-1157x1536.webp 1157w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ridley-Ignite-GTX-3-1542x2048.webp 1542w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ridley-Ignite-GTX-3-750x996.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ridley-Ignite-GTX-3-1140x1514.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ridley-Ignite-GTX-3-scaled.webp 1928w\" /><figcaption>Ridley </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Ignite GTX is fitted with a Ritchey Venturemax bar with a wide 24 degree flare and a short reach and drop. At the hoods, the three bar sizes have a width of between 42cm and 46cm, while at the drops this extends out to 54.7cm to 58.7cm to offer added control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spec-wise, Ridley offers its new bike with SRAM Rival 1 and Apex 1 11-speed, as well as Rival/GX Eagle AXS 12-speed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-gravel-gearing-how-to-get-lower-gears\" target=\"_blank\">mullet </a>and Shimano GRX 1×12-speed groupsets. You get suitably MTB-style Vittoria Barzo 2.25 inch tyres on wheels from Ridley’s Forza component brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course it wouldn’t be a drop bar MTB without a suspension fork, which in this case comes from Rockshox and offers 100mm of travel with a bar-mounted lockout, up from the more typical 30mm or 40mm for gravel bike suspension forks. There’s a rigid fork option too for gravel bike purists, with the fork length designed to be suspension-corrected.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n
