MagTag is the ultra-slim, <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-with-apple-find-my?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-1706&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-works-with-apple-find-my-app-25-05-02&amp;utm_term=SALE-327501\" target=\"_blank\">credit card–sized tracker that slides into your wallet</a> or bag and keeps tabs on your stuff, without bulking up your pockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike chunky AirTags that feel like you’re carrying a pebble in your pants, MagTag is just 1.5mm thick. It syncs flawlessly with Apple’s FindMy app, so whether your bag is in your living room or halfway to another continent, <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-with-apple-find-my?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-1706&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-works-with-apple-find-my-app-25-05-02&amp;utm_term=SALE-327501\" target=\"_blank\">you’ll know exactly where it is</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Left something behind? MagTag sends you a heads-up alert before your valuables get too far, and if you’re <em>really</em> scrambling, a loud beep will guide you to victory (or at least your backpack). It even has a built-in keyring hole so you can tag keys, lanyards, or anything else you’re prone to misplacing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s wirelessly rechargeable and lasts up to 5 months per charge. It’s also IP68 waterproof, so whether you’re caught in a downpour or accidentally drop your wallet in a puddle (again), your MagTag keeps working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slimmer than an AirTag, rechargeable, and smart enough to keep your life together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grab <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-with-apple-find-my?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-1706&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-works-with-apple-find-my-app-25-05-02&amp;utm_term=SALE-327501\" target=\"_blank\">a MagTag (or two) while it’s on sale for $32.99</a> (reg. $59.99).</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp2.stackassets.com/d4ae964c5f6c24fd2884d377c9419a7db1ab3937/store/bba54c79cfcc980df622114edb3c9b8149e0525bce8c9f709c99fd8d0668/sale_327501_primary_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>MagTag Ultra Slim Tracker Card – Works with Apple Find My App<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-with-apple-find-my?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-1706&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=magtag-ultra-slim-tracker-card-works-with-apple-find-my-app-2025-05-06&amp;utm_term=SALE-327501\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com/?utm_content=PS-1706&amp;utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=Referral\"><em>StackSocial</em></a><em> prices subject to change.</em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ac3734a3d07723a08de90c6d0ac1ea66655b2c25f5e482714377afa0ce81de91","category":"Apple"}
