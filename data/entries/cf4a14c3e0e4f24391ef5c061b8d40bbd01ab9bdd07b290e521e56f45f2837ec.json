Luckily, Robyn Davidson and Ewan Wilson specialise in turning the frogs of the bottomless abyss into ravishing royalty so you’ve got a wealth of reading material to drown out the fading wails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robyn recapped the pro-cycling week that was in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-il-lombardia\" target=\"_blank\">Pro Log</a> while Ewan stared pensively through the cycling world’s sliding doors to imagine a world where <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-if-tadej-pogacar-didnt-exist\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar was merely a jumble of letters</a> and question whether his 2024 season – back in the universe where he does exist – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pogacar-vs-merckx\" target=\"_blank\">was better than the Cannibal’s best</a>. Felix Lowe’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-how-to-fix-ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">piece on the perpetual Ineos omnishambles </a>– deepened by Pidders-gate – has been drawing intense debate over on our Facebook page. James and Will also chatted to <em>the</em> Peter Sagan about cycling real bikes and cycling imaginary bikes for the latest edition of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/peter-sagan-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">the Cyclist Magazine Podcast</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the more practical stakes, Katherine Moore has been running the rule over some new lights, with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/lezyne-micro-drive-800-strip-drive-300-led-lights-review\" target=\"_blank\">Lezyne Micro Drive 800+</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/exposure-sirius-mk10-tracer-mk3-reakt-pack-lights-review\" target=\"_blank\">Exposure Siriius Mk10 and the TraceR Mk3</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ravemen-fr300-and-cl05-lights-review\" target=\"_blank\">Ravemen FR300 </a>light sets all reviewed.

When I was about seven years old, on a family holiday on the Isle of Wight, I watched, open-mouthed, as two lads rolled up next to our campsite on their heavily laden bikes. Within a few minutes they were cooking food, drinking beers, and putting up a tent. I turned to my parents and said, ‘Can I do that?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t even imagine the kind of rudimentary pannier setup those lads were rocking back in the 90s, but boy could they have done with some Tailfin innovation. With its headquarters in Bristol, this bike luggage brand knows a thing or two about keeping your kit safe and dry when the elements are telling you that you’re eight metres below sea level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The launch of the Tailfin Bar Bag System completes its bikepacking set, so you can tail to snout in Tailfin. It comes in four sizes (two each for drop or flat handlebars) and the focus is on stability, adjustability and speed of mounting, thanks in part to its WaveLock closure and X-Clamp attachment system.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/tailfin1-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/tailfin1-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/tailfin1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/tailfin1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/tailfin1-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/tailfin1-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/tailfin1-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/tailfin1-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/tailfin1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/tailfin1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/tailfin1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The pictured bag extends from 4L to 9.1L, features a 1.6L expandable pocket, and Tailfin provides very specific instructions to ensure there is no head tube rubbing. It’s compatible with round handlebars, is 100% waterproof, and comes with additional mounts for bike computers, lights and cameras.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full disclosure, the setup is like a miniature flatpack project, but thankfully you only need to do that once – plus I only swore four times in the process, which is my own little KOM. Once you’re up and running, the bag works brilliantly. The waterproofing is faultless and the wide entry point means accessing kit is easy. Plus, the additional pockets and attachments ensure that you don’t need to come up with some wizardry to keep your usual endurance accoutrements – namely head units, lights and charging points – still functioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"http://tailfin.cc\" target=\"_blank\">Tailfin (£230)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/peter-sagan-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 116: Peter Sagan, highs and lows of a triple World Champ</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-if-tadej-pogacar-didnt-exist\">What if Tadej Pogačar didn’t exist?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-il-lombardia\">Pro Log: Pogačar and Pidcock make headlines at Il Lombardia;

As well as being stuffed with lightweight and 100% recycled Primaloft synthetic insulation, the surface of the vest has a DWR coating to brush off light showers so it’s pretty handy in the moderate to poor weather we Brits experience on a day-to-day basis. It packs down easily into a jacket pocket, meaning it’s useful when you aren’t quite sure how cold the atmosphere beneath that grey sky is going to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favourite part is the cycling-centric two-way zip, so you can ambi-zip to your heart’s content.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"http://rapha.cc\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha (£140)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Suunto Sonic Headphones</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/DSC02210-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/DSC02210-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/DSC02210-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/DSC02210-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/DSC02210-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/DSC02210-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/DSC02210-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/DSC02210-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/DSC02210-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/DSC02210-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/DSC02210-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The advent of bone-conducting technology means it’s now far safer to ride while listening to audio.

Be that as it may, I’m now a total convert to pocketed bibs as it essentially allows you to be less organised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel is here to stay – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/stuff-of-legends-the-rough-stuff-fellowship\" target=\"_blank\">not that it ever wasn’t here</a> – and British brand Le Col has decided to throw their off-road hat into the ring with the launch of its ARC range.

Le Col says the chamois has impact absorption technology (as you’d expect) and features a bamboo-blend top sheet that is said to be quick drying. There are pockets for days – with the usual leg pouches for gels and Tabasco topped up by a pair of rear pockets above the derrière.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ARC Lightweight Rain Jacket is made in partnership with laminate producer Pertex, using its PFAs-free membrane to provide waterproofing and breathability. Le Col claims the fabric weighs just a claimed 83g so it’s ideal for stuffing away in a pocket on longer rides. Its less-common feature is the hood, which is big enough to accommodate a helmet so you can keep your entire top half dry. Sure, it might not be the most aero or svelte look in the world, but staying dry is a decent payout.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"http://lecol.cc\" target=\"_blank\">Le Col (£210 and £280)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p><em><strong>Ad feature</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Daysaver’s Essential8 packs 8 tools into just 33 grams</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"2048\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/Daysaver-image-scaled.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/Daysaver-image-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/Daysaver-image-240x300.jpg 240w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/Daysaver-image-776x970.jpg 776w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/Daysaver-image-768x960.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/Daysaver-image-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/Daysaver-image-1639x2048.jpg 1639w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/Daysaver-image-750x937.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/1999/02/Daysaver-image-1140x1425.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The smallest and lightest bike multitool with uncompromising functionality.

All in all: a destination I would recommend.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/peter-sagan-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 116: Peter Sagan, highs and lows of a triple World Champ</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-if-tadej-pogacar-didnt-exist\">What if Tadej Pogačar didn’t exist?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-il-lombardia\">Pro Log: Pogačar and Pidcock make headlines at Il Lombardia; Teammateless Zoe Bäckstedt rides to third on GC; Velo d’Or nominees announced; Cyclocross bust-up</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pogacar-vs-merckx\">Pogačar vs Merckx: Who had the best season ever?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/fizik-tempo-beat-shoes\">In the Drops: Do-it-all Fizik shoes, do-it-all Panaracer tyres, easy chain waxing kit, new Shokz headphones and Magdalena Bay</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/rapha-insulated-vest\">In The Drops: Rapha Insulated Vest, edgy Le Col gravel kit, adaptable Tailfin bar bag, safety-conscious Suunto headphones and the US of A</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Laurence Kilpatrick &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"cf4a14c3e0e4f24391ef5c061b8d40bbd01ab9bdd07b290e521e56f45f2837ec","category":"Cycling"}
