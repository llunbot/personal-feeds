However, for reasons that remain unclear, WhatsApp decided to disable them shortly after their initial release. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature is currently making its way through beta testing again via TestFlight, so expect it to roll out to all WhatsApp users in the coming days.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/whatsapp-testing-clear-badge-unread-messages/\">WhatsApp Re-Testing 'Clear Badge' Feature for Unread Messages</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-re-testing-clear-badge-feature-for-unread-messages.2449684/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7bcb55dd6e00df0114fbdc73fb3264f152d854ce9e57d3a3e603ede069286b2b","category":"Apple"}
