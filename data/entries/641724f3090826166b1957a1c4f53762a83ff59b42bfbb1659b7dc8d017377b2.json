The device, carrying the model number A3211, matches the specifications seen in the FCC listing. Certification listings such as these are necessary steps before a product can be brought to market, and their appearance typically signals a launch within weeks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nImages included in the NCC listing provide additional views of the new Beats Pill's design, which retains the familiar pill-shaped aesthetic of its predecessors. The front of the device is entirely covered by the speaker grille with prominent \"Beats\" branding. There are four physical buttons on the top and a USB-C port is located on the rear. The new model also includes a lanyard hole on the side. The device is expected to be available in three colors: Black, Gold, and Red.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBasketball star <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/20/lebron-james-unreleased-beats-pill/\">LeBron James</a> and Formula 1 driver <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/unreleased-beats-pill-daniel-ricciardo/\">Daniel Ricciardo</a> were among the first to be spotted with the new Beats Pill over the past month. These sightings were followed by the speaker's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-beats-pill-ios-17-5/\">appearance in the iOS 17.5 Release Candidate</a>. While Apple has not officially announced the new Beats Pill, the multiple certifications and celebrity sightings indicate that its launch is almost certainly very soon. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/24/new-beats-pill-speaker-spotted-database/\">New Beats Pill Speaker Spotted in Another Database as Launch Nears</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-beats-pill-speaker-spotted-in-another-database-as-launch-nears.2427283/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"641724f3090826166b1957a1c4f53762a83ff59b42bfbb1659b7dc8d017377b2","category":"Apple"}
