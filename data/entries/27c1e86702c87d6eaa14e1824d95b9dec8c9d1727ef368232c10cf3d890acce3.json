These prices are available to all shoppers and do not require a coupon code.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 256GB model is on sale for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3BVWJ6Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$829.00</strong></a> and the 512GB model is available for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3CGXWN4%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$1,029.00</strong></a>. These deals are only available on Amazon right now, and the retailer has each model on sale in all four colors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3BVWJ6Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$170 OFF</div>13-inch M2 MacBook Air (256GB) for $829.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3CGXWN4%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$170 OFF</div>13-inch M2 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,029.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing the introduction of the M3 MacBook Air, Apple knocked the price of the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air down by $100, and it's still selling them alongside the M3 model. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-air-generations-compared/\">main difference between the two generations</a> lies in the performance upgrade that the M3 chip brings, so if your priority is saving money you stand to benefit from Amazon's steep discounts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/studio-display-purple-february.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nSecondly, Amazon has again dropped the price of the Apple Studio Display (Standard Glass) down to <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\"><strong>$1,299.99</strong></a>, down from $1,599.00. This is the model with the tilt-adjustable stand, although you can find the same deal on the VESA mount adapter model right now on Amazon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$299 OFF</div>Apple Studio Display (Standard Glass) for $1,299.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Apple Studio Display is a 27-inch monitor that features 5K resolution, supports up to 600 nits of brightness, P3 Wide color for vivid colors, and True Tone to match the white balance of the display to the lighting in the room.
