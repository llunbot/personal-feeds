{"title":"Apple Pencil 3 Could Feature Magnetic Tips for Different Drawing Styles, Sketchy Rumor Claims","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/","date":1696259788000,"content":"The third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> could be available with a range of interchangeable tips to emulate different drawing styles, according to a sketchy rumor shared by the X (formerly Twitter) user known as \"<a href=\"https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1708118363631743055?s=20\">Majin Bu</a>.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/m2-ipad-pro-apple-pencil-hover.jpeg\" alt width=\"1280\" height=\"596\" />\r<br />\nThe next-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌ will apparently come with different tips for drawing, technical drawing, and painting that connect magnetically. Majin Bu did not share any further details about the device. After a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil-3/\">flurry of rumors</a> in 2021, rumors about a third-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌ model noticeably died down and nothing has been heard about the product until now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn March 2021, the leaker known as \"Mr. White\" shared an image purporting to depict a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-allegedly-leaks/\">next-generation Apple Pencil prototype</a> that featured a shorter design, glossy finish, and a larger, deeper tip. Apple was believed to have worked on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/apple-working-on-smaller-apple-pencil/\">smaller Apple Pencil</a> designed for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/16/apple-planned-iphone-apple-pencil/\">$49 model for the iPhone</a>, but both products never emerged and are said to have been canceled entirely.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is worth noting that while Majin Bu often aggregates and shares information related to Apple's plans, they do not have a solid track record. The current ‌Apple Pencil‌ is the second-generation version introduced alongside the 2018 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, meaning that it is one of the oldest Apple devices still on sale. As such, it is fairly likely that Apple has plans to launch a third-generation model at some point, and the company still <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/17/apple-pencil-color-sensor-patent/\">files patents</a> on new technologies for the accessory, but the latest rumor should still be taken with a pinch of salt until it is corroborated.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/\">Majin Bu</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139\">iPad Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/\">Apple Pencil 3 Could Feature Magnetic Tips for Different Drawing Styles, Sketchy Rumor Claims</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips-for-different-drawing-styles-sketchy-rumor-claims.2405953/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3e5d84b69aee65d7cba8890e4d992425a6e080a10a6c89a7cd616260a5fd0d88","category":"Apple"}
