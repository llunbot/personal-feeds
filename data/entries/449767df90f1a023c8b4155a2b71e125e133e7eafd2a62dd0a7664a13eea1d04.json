Liv has updated its Flourish bike line to maximize comfort for women cyclists. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Flourish line has been around since at least 2016, aimed at female cyclists looking for a comfortable commuter bike. For its latest models, Liv “meticulously custom-designed” each size of the line, using women’s “body dimension data and riding experiences to deliver an ideal geometry for most women,” the company said in a press release. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hem-weight-clipped-to-a-dress.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hem-weight-clipped-to-a-dress-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hem-weight-clipped-to-a-dress-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hem-weight-clipped-to-a-dress-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hem-weight-clipped-to-a-dress-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hem-weight-clipped-to-a-dress-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hem-weight-clipped-to-a-dress-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hem-weight-clipped-to-a-dress.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Each bike in the Flourish line even includes a hem weight for comfortable riding in a dress. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyclists can choose from the existing Flourish model, with rim brakes, or the new Flourish Disc, with disc brakes. Both come in a variety of colors, models and sizes, the company said, offering riders a bike it calls “chic and practical.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We created the Flourish for women seeking a bike that is not only enjoyable but also effortless to ride around town,” Meg Hung, road category manager for Liv, said in the press release. “Whether it’s commuting to work, meeting friends, or making a quick trip to the store, riders will find that the Flourish provides thoughtful functionality.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Liv-Flourish-Disc-0-in-Silver-Pine.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Liv-Flourish-Disc-0-in-Silver-Pine-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Liv-Flourish-Disc-0-in-Silver-Pine-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Liv-Flourish-Disc-0-in-Silver-Pine-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Liv-Flourish-Disc-0-in-Silver-Pine-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Liv-Flourish-Disc-0-in-Silver-Pine-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Liv-Flourish-Disc-0-in-Silver-Pine-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Liv-Flourish-Disc-0-in-Silver-Pine.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Liv’s new Flourish, with the Pine color.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Liv Flourish: Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main update to the Flourish bikes is found in the frame redesign, which aims for a “modern” appearance, as well as a better fit. There’s also a size L frame now, which accommodates riders up to 182cm tall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only difference between the Flourish and the Flourish Disc is in the brakes. Otherwise, the line shares the same features. These include an <a href=\"https://www.giant-bicycles.com/global/aluxx-slr\" target=\"_blank\">ALUXX-grade</a> step-through aluminum frame, and a <a href=\"https://www.bike-discount.de/en/selle-royal-essenza-plus-saddle\" target=\"_blank\">Selle Royal Essenza+</a> saddle. There’s five entries under each nameplate, and the two single speed variants each get a Gates Carbon belt drive.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Selle-Royal-Essenza-saddle.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Selle-Royal-Essenza-saddle-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Selle-Royal-Essenza-saddle-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Selle-Royal-Essenza-saddle-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Selle-Royal-Essenza-saddle-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Selle-Royal-Essenza-saddle-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Selle-Royal-Essenza-saddle-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Selle-Royal-Essenza-saddle.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>The Flourish comes with a Selle Royal Essenza+ saddle. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessories include the complete set of usual suspects, including fenders, kickstand, and a chain cover. Curatively, Liv includes a hem weight (for keeping that skirt arranged properly) that mounts to the frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Select models also feature other accessories like lights, a rack, and a basket.
