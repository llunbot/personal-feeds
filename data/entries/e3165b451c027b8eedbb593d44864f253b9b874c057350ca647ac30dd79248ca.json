Developed from scratch around the eEWS-dominating Bosch powertrain, the new Canyon Strive:ON is race-ready for the UCI World Cup EDR-E electric enduro series. Featuring a tough but light carbon frame inspired by the success of Canyon’s recent Spectral:ON eMTB, this new enduro-racing ebike is designed to fly fast down the most demanding timed stages in mountain biking, then zoom back up the ascents, with super fast pit crew battery swaps along the way. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Canyon Strive:ON CFR carbon enduro race ebike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_photo-by-Boris-Beyer.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_photo-by-Boris-Beyer-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Strive:ON CFR eMTB, race-ready carbon enduro ebike, photo by Boris Beyer, Fab's bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_photo-by-Boris-Beyer-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_photo-by-Boris-Beyer-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_photo-by-Boris-Beyer-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_photo-by-Boris-Beyer-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_photo-by-Boris-Beyer-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_photo-by-Boris-Beyer.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.

control on the technical timed uphill race sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bosch Enduro-powered</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a

Bosch CX Race motor, enduro race-ready geometry was probably the biggest driving factor in creating the Strive:ON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, it seemed that the most-apt geometry comparison might have been the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2022-canyon-spectralon-cfr-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Spectral:ON CFR</a> (<em>which has 155mm rear/150mm fork travel</em>) because of the evolved similarities between the regular Strive &amp; Spectral. But this new Strive:ON is much more a speed &amp; gravity-oriented ebike than an all-mountain one. And befitting of such, it takes a longer and slacker approach, while sticking with a 29″ front / 27.5″ rear mullet wheel setup. In fact, we can’t really compare it to the old aluminum Torque:ON bikepark ebike either, as that gets a major upgrade to match this enduro ebike today, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_geometry.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_geometry-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Strive:ON CFR eMTB, race-ready carbon enduro ebike, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_geometry-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_geometry-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_geometry-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_geometry-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_geometry-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_geometry.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What that means is a gravity slack 63.5° headtube angle, a full 1.5cm longer in Reach than the Spectral:ON or the alloy Torque:ON (<em>now up to 500mm for a Large</em>), longer 445mm chainstays for a bit more stability, and just 25mm of bottom bracket drop to help clear obstacles and technical trails. Plus, it gets an incredibly steep 78° seat tube angle, as getting rider weight forward for timed stage technical climbs is critical to being able to maintain front wheel grip and to limit spinning out the rear wheel. And that more forward position is key while climbing to balance the overall slower handling of the ebike’s additional weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>eEnduro Tech Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_frameset-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_frameset-detail-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Strive:ON CFR eMTB, race-ready carbon enduro ebike, frameset detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_frameset-detail-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_frameset-detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_frameset-detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_frameset-detail-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_frameset-detail-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-Canyon-StriveON-CFR-eMTB_race-ready-carbon-enduro-ebike_frameset-detail.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From a technical side, I was a bit surprised that the e-Strive does NOT include the ShapeShifter geometry-altering tech that makes the regular Strive unique.
