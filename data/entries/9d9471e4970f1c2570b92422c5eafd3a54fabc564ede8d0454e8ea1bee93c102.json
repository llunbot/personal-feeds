Some users have continued to experience Wi-Fi issues on iOS 17.1.1, so perhaps iOS 17.1.2 will include the same <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/ios-17-2-beta-addresses-wifi-issues/\">fix for Wi-Fi connectivity issues</a> that Apple already included in the iOS 17.2 beta. Some users have also experienced minor bugs related to push notifications, HomeKit, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 16.1.2 was released during the week after U.S. Thanksgiving last year, so there is precedent for a bug-fix update being released this week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.1.2 would be the second bug-fix update for the iPhone this month after iOS 17.1.1, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-ios-17-1-1/\">fixed a BMW wireless charging issue</a> affecting the iPhone 15 lineup, and an issue preventing the Weather app widget from showing a snow icon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing iOS 17.1.2, Apple is expected to release iOS 17.2, which has been in beta testing for around a month now. The update includes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-2-beta-features/\">many new features and changes</a>, including Apple's Journal app, support for spatial video recording on iPhone 15 Pro models, a Translate option for the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro models, the ability for Apple Music subscribers to collaborate on playlists, an iMessage Contact Key Verification security option for high-profile individuals, additional Weather and Clock widgets, and more.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/27/ios-17-1-2-coming-soon/\">iOS 17.1.2 Update for iPhone Likely to Be Released This Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-2-update-for-iphone-likely-to-be-released-this-week.2412148/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9d9471e4970f1c2570b92422c5eafd3a54fabc564ede8d0454e8ea1bee93c102","category":"Apple"}
