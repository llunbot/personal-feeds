But Apple does include features that you’ll want to use regularly as soon as you discover them, and macOS Sequoia is no exception in this case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the top six features in the latest Mac operating system, macOS Sequoia. Sequoia has many more features, but these are the ones that will convince you to press that download button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about macOS Sequoia, check out the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS Sequoia superguide: Everything you need to know about the Mac update</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677467/how-to-get-mac-ready-new-macos-update.html\">How to get your Mac ready for macOS Sequoia</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">How to install macOS Sequoia on your Mac</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>iPhone mirroring</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iphone-mirroring.gif?w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone Mirroring Sequoia\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<div><figure><img alt=\"iPhone Mirroring Sequoia\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<div><figure><img alt=\"iPhone Mirroring Sequoia\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Mac users tend to also use iPhones, and while iCloud helps with syncing between the two platforms, there’s still a clear line of separation between the two. With iPhone Mirroring, that line blurs quite a bit, allowing users to access their iPhones directly from their Macs—literally. The feature allows you to see your iPhone’s screen on your Mac to check notifications, launch apps, and do anything else you’d do if your phone was in your hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use this feature, you do need to meet some requirements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your Mac must be an M-series model or an Intel Mac with a T2 chip</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The iPhone must have <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a> installed</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth need to be on</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With iPhone Mirroring, your iPhone appears on your Mac and you can use it as if was in your hands–well, almost, because using a mouse/trackpad on your Mac is different from an iPhone touchscreen. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2404049/how-iphone-mirroring-lets-you-access-your-iphone-on-your-mac-in-macos-sequoia.html\">Get all the details on iPhone Mirroring</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>Window tiling</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/macos-sequoia-windows-tiling-green-button.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"macOS Sequoia windows tiling green button\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<div><figure><img alt=\"macOS Sequoia windows tiling green button\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<div><figure><img alt=\"macOS Sequoia windows tiling green button\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You see that mess of windows you have open on your Mac right now? It’s going to get a lot better with macOS Sequoia’s window tiling. When you drag a window to the edge of the screen, you’ll find a place on the desktop where you can slot that window. You can sort your windows and make it easier to find the one you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sequoia’s window tiling has some limits, but it’ll be good enough for most people. If not, there are an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365751/macos-sequoia-windows-tiling-dont-ditch-that-tiling-app.html\">array of third-party windows tiling utilities available</a> that extend the capability.

(Yes, this site included.) You can now make them disappear with a click in Safari in macOS Sequoia (and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a>). With Distraction Control turned on, all you have to do is point abnd click on an element, and poof! It’s gone.

Or you use the same password for all your accounts because it’s too difficult to remember all those complicated letters, numbers, and symbols. Don’t do that anymore! Get started with good security habits by using the new Password app in macOS Sequoia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Passwords app  ties into Safari and it’s also on iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, so your passwords are accessible no matter which platform you are using. If you Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, extensions are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you already use a third-party password manager, bravo! You probably won’t abandon it. Check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2426299/apple-passwords-app-ios-18-macos-replace-password-manager.html\">hands-on with the iOS 18 Passwords app</a>–but the Sequoia version is nearly identical. </p>\n</div></div>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>Better Notes app</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/sequoia-notes.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Sequoia Notes app\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<div><figure><img alt=\"Sequoia Notes app\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<div><figure><img alt=\"Sequoia Notes app\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Notes has become my go-to app for both little bits of stuff I need to stash and for long-form notes–that’s probably true for you, too. With Notes in macOS Sequoia, Apple has added several new features to make it even more useful:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You can now record audio clips within a note.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Notes can create a searchable transcript that’s in sync with the audio.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sections are collapsible to make it easier to scan your note.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Math expressions are calculated within your note.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support for color highlights to make text stand out.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>Retro ‘Macintosh’ wallpaper</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/sequoia-macintosh-wallpeper-orange.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"sequoia macintosh wallpeper orange\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<div><figure><img alt=\"sequoia macintosh wallpeper orange\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n<div><figure><img alt=\"sequoia macintosh wallpeper orange\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I saved the best new feature for last. (I’m exaggerating, but this is pretty cool.) Apple always adds new wallpaper in major macOS upgrades, but the one in Sequoia is a new surprise. The new “Macintosh” wallpaper artistically showcases old UI elements of the original Mac operating system in an array of colors. It looks fantastic and is a wonderful ode to the Mac’s origins. The “Macintosh” wallpaper can also be used as a screen saver.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n<div><div></div><div>\n<h2>What about Apple Intelligence?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Why are none of the AI-based features called Apple Intelligence not on this list? They’re not ready yet–Apple announced that Apple Intelligence will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369986/apple-intelligence-siri-features-coming-after-ios-18-launch.html\">start to roll out AI features</a> with macOS 15.1 next month, with more to come across 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few Apple Intelligence features are in the Sequoia 15.1 beta that is currently in beta testing. The features it includes are summaries, writing tools, photo search, and more. It doesn’t have any ChatGPT-based features, which will come next year.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div></div>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c71d0e8e9068627bc7ab234eb201a65894dc38b45a60d1a656d529a8aff42f7a","category":"Apple"}
