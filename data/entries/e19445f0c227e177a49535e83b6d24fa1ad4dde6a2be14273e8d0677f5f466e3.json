Spatial Audio is supported according to the code, but we don't know what other features to expect at this time. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are three colors in the files, including black, pink, and blue. We can expect some of the changes that were brought to the Beats Studio Pro last year, such as improved sound quality and support for Personalized Spatial Audio. The headphones will support the same gestures as the Studio Pro, with a press on the \"b\" button to play/pause and answer calls, a double press to skip songs, and a long press to activate <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>. Apple will also likely swap the old micro-USB port for a new USB-C port to bring the headphones in line with the rest of its products. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Here are some videos of the new Beats Solo 4 <a href=\"https://t.co/I9MwTDUUaR\">https://t.co/I9MwTDUUaR</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/nx8wdP23At\">pic.twitter.com/nx8wdP23At</a></p>â€” Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1762559410654822768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nApple first released the Solo 3 headphones way back in 2016, and while there have been multiple color updates, nothing else has changed since then.
