Nearly every icon on your home screen reveals a menu of options when you touch and hold. These have varying degrees of usefulness, but one that I’ve found most helpful and that many people were unaware of is touching and holding the Settings app itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This reveals a menu with items for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Cellular, and Battery, the four most common reasons you’re likely to consult the Settings app. Tap any of these options, and you’re taken directly to the Settings section for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re trying to connect Bluetooth headphones, switch Wi-Fi networks, or change Cellular details, you’re right where you want to be.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-settings-touch-hold.png\" alt=\"iOS Settings: Touch and hold to see options for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Cellular Data, and Battery\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-settings-touch-hold.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1179w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-settings-touch-hold.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-settings-touch-hold.png?resize=300%2C297&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-settings-touch-hold.png?resize=768%2C761&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1014\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>A useful shortcut is to touch and hold the Settings icon on the home screen.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iOS Settings: Touch and hold to see options for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Cellular Data, and Battery\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-settings-touch-hold.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1179w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-settings-touch-hold.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-settings-touch-hold.png?resize=300%2C297&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-settings-touch-hold.png?resize=768%2C761&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1014\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>A useful shortcut is to touch and hold the Settings icon on the home screen.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iOS Settings: Touch and hold to see options for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Cellular Data, and Battery\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-settings-touch-hold.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1179w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-settings-touch-hold.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-settings-touch-hold.png?resize=300%2C297&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-settings-touch-hold.png?resize=768%2C761&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1014\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>A useful shortcut is to touch and hold the Settings icon on the home screen.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use the Control Center as a shortcut. Swipe to reveal it, then touch and hold the lozenge in the upper-left that contains all the network icons. This reveals a larger lozenge with loads more information. You can see at a glance what Wi-Fi network your iPhone is connected to, the last Bluetooth connection your iPhone made (by app or device), and how AirDrop and Personal Hotspot are configured. The Airplane Mode icon shows On or Off, but that’s also easily seen by its color, so the text label is extra.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-network-lozenges-sbs.png\" alt=\"iOS Control Center Network\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-network-lozenges-sbs.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-network-lozenges-sbs.png?resize=300%2C191&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-network-lozenges-sbs.png?resize=768%2C488&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"650\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>The Control Center network lozenges let you access network settings quickly.
