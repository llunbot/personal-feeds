Over at Amazon, it just got a brand new best price as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX23V2ZK\">13-inch laptop dives down to $850</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX23GFMJ/\">15-inch model gets a price cut to $1,050</a>, a savings of $250 and the lowest price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed the new MacBook Air with an M3 chip</a>, we gave it a 4.5-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award. Even though we tested the 15-inch model, it’s basically identical to the 13-inch model other than the screen size. And let us tell you—it’s pretty fantastic. The laptop has a spectacular battery life, delivers nice performance no matter what you’re using it for, and is super light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The MacBook Air is a great laptop, especially for users who prioritize mobility. Thanks to Apple silicon, it can handle whatever task you need to do, whether it’s as simple as using a word processor while being online with a gazillion Safari tabs open, or a bit more complex with iMovie and GarageBand, or pro-level work with a video production tool or software development,” we noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M3 MacBook Air features a powerful 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU, making it a versatile device that can easily handle work, fun, and even some gaming. And with an all-day battery life, you won’t have to worry about taking your charger along if you don’t want to carry any extra weight. And speaking of weight, the MacBook Air is incredibly light as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an outstanding deal for a top-tier laptop that combines performance and portability, so make sure you get one as soon as possible because we can’t know how long this deal will be available. So go ahead and grab one one today.</p>\n\n\n<span>The MacBook Air M3 is down to a new best price of $850</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX23V2ZK\" target=\"_blank\">Get it at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ef45d0c904d336b972f3fa6168fe5f06201f209d3772b395310de12539e7e78a","category":"Apple"}
