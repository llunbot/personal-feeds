But as we speculated in our write-up of what ended up being the show’s series finale, an expensive show with a huge cast, tons of complicated costuming and effects, and extensive location shooting only makes mathematical sense if it’s a megahit, and <em>The Wheel of Time</em> was never a megahit.</p>\n<h2>Adapting the unadaptable</h2>\n<p>I was sad about the cancellation announcement because I believe this season was the one where the show found its footing, both as an adaptation of a complex book series and as a fun TV show in its own right. But I wasn't <em>surprised</em> by it. The only thing I found surprising was that it took this long to happen.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/it-was-probably-always-going-to-end-this-way-for-amazons-wheel-of-time-show/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/it-was-probably-always-going-to-end-this-way-for-amazons-wheel-of-time-show/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8dd2768bd22be4ed2f8b0b06d1e49bd9a737e1cb36b2fcd00ad89ceb0ed98bea","category":"Tech"}
