{"title":"Apple’s Burned Trust","link":"https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/1433250588909780995","date":1630628514000,"content":"\n<p>fJohn Siracusa, on Twitter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sure, your “reader” app can include one (1) approved link to your\nwebsite … but will you be allowed to have any text near that link\nexplaining why someone might want to tap on it, or is that still\nforbidden? This is where we are, mentally, when considering App\nStore rules in 2021.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I heard from one reader in the racket wondering if Apple is going to require these apps to <em>also</em> offer Apple’s IAP to be allowed to include a link to a website. I have another friend, who works on a popular subscription app that <em>does</em> use IAP, who’s wondering if they’re going to be <em>allowed</em> to also have a link to their website now, and doubting it.</p>\n\n<p>That’s how much trust Apple has burned.</p>\n\n<p>The spirit of Apple’s settlement with the Japan Fair Trade Commission is clear: these “reader” apps are going to be permitted to link users to their websites for signing up and buying media like e-books, movies, and music. Within that spirit, <em>of course</em> they’re going to be allowed to have text explaining this, and <em>of course</em> they’re not going to be required to <em>also</em> offer Apple’s IAP for these same purchases.</p>\n\n<p>But very reasonable, smart people are genuinely skeptical that Apple is going to adhere to the spirit of this settlement.</p>\n\n<p>Call me a fool, but I think Apple is going to follow through and do the right thing by these apps. There are a lot of negative adjectives that I’d apply to Apple regarding the App Store. <em>Greedy</em>, <em>inconsistent</em>, <em>frustrating</em>, <em>shortsighted</em>, <em>capricious</em>, <em>officious</em>, <em>technically illiterate</em>. Did I say <em>greedy</em>? But one thing Apple is not and never has been is devious. Apple does not play tricks. And the JFTC would not take kindly to tricks.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/02/apples-burned-trust\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ac766ddfa19ec41989c95e8ae75abab31754dac4581eb81c830377bd450db1f3","category":"Tech"}
