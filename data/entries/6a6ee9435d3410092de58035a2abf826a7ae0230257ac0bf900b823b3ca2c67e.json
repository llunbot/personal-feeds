First, we got a batch of late-spring and summer midrange GPU launches, including AMD's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-amds-269-rx-7600-is-a-good-1080p-card-but-the-rtx-4060-looms/\">Radeon RX 7600</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amd-rx-7700-xt-and-7800-xt-review-closing-out-the-fine-i-guess-gpu-generation/\">7700 XT, and 7800 XT</a>, plus Nvidia's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/geforce-rtx-4060-review-not-thrilling-but-a-super-efficient-299-workhorse/\">GeForce RTX 4060</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-nvidias-399-rtx-4060-ti-is-mostly-a-step-forward-but-only-a-small-one/\">4060 Ti</a>. Second, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/starfield-impressions-putting-the-vast-back-in-vast-cosmos/\">Bethesda's <em>Starfield</em> finally dropped</a>, prompting a whole bunch of people to ask \"can my PC run <em>Starfield</em>?\"</p>\n\n<p><em>Starfield</em> <a href=\"https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/60442\">isn't an exceptionally demanding</a> PC game, at least not by the standards set by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/the-last-of-us-first-pc-port-is-riddled-with-apparent-performance-issues/\">buggy PC ports</a> like <em>The Last of Us</em>. But it will give any PC more than 3 or 4 years old a serious workout, and it should serve as a decent yardstick for building a PC that can run this console generation's games fairly well.</p>\n<p>This guide will focus on just minor tweaks to our spring PC builds, since other component pricing hasn't changed much and there haven't been major CPU introductions since then (Intel's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/next-gen-core-and-core-ultra-cpus-lose-an-i-as-intel-shuffles-its-branding/\">don't-call-them-14th-generation</a> Core processors may be out within a few months, but on the desktop they'll be a mild refresh of 13th-gen, which was already a mild refresh of 12th-gen).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966077#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966077&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6a6ee9435d3410092de58035a2abf826a7ae0230257ac0bf900b823b3ca2c67e","category":"Tech"}
