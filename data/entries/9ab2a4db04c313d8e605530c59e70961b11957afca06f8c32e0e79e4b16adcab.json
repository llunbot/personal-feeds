Even the iconic Beats \"b\" logo button for controlling media is in neon green, and there's a hidden neon green creeper on the inside of the headband.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/beats-solo-4-minecraft-logo.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nMinecraft branding extends to the case for the Solo 4 headphones, with the Beats logo and raised Minecraft pixelated patterns in neon green on the front panel. As with the standard versions of the Solo 4 headphones, the nylon case zips open to allow the folded headphones to slide in, and there are small pockets inside for the included USB-C to USB-C and 3.5mm to 3.5mm cables.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/beats-solo-4-minecraft-live.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWith the purchase of the Beats x Minecraft Special Edition Solo 4 headphones, customers will also receive a unique code that can be redeemed for an in-game headphone character creator item in Minecraft.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/beats-minecraft-characters.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAs a refresher, the Beats Solo 4 on-ear headphones support Bluetooth, wired USB-C, and wired 3.5mm connections, as well as support for Personalized Spatial Audio. They offer up to 50 hours of battery life when connected via Bluetooth, and a Fast Fuel charge gives you up to five hours of playback with just ten minutes of charging. There's no active noise cancelation included, but the on-ear design does help to block out a decent amount of ambient sound.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA proprietary Beats chip platform offers tight integration for both iOS and Android users, including support for one-touch pairing, automatic setup across devices via <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> or Google, and support for Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> and Android's ‌Find My‌ Device services. iOS users also get access to always-on \"Hey <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>\" functionality and support for Audio Sharing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nAs part of the Beats x Minecraft collaboration, there's a new promotional animated short film featuring \"Wake Up,\" the latest track from Imagine Dragons, and Minecraft content creator TinaKitten is curating a Spatial Audio playlist on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>.
