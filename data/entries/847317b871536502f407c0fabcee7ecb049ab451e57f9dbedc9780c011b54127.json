{"title":"Also From the Archive: ‘“Beta” Is Not an Excuse’","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2006/11/beta_excuse","date":1736306601000,"content":"\n<p>2006 post from yours truly that applies perfectly <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/bbc_news_apple_intelligence_notification_summaries\">to Apple Intelligence today</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The sentiment here is that it’s somehow unfair to developers\nto treat software labeled “beta” with the same critical eye\nas non-beta software. That’s true, in the case of actual beta\nsoftware, where by “actual beta” I mean “not yet released,\nbut close”.</p>\n\n<p>Released vs. not-released is the distinction that warrants\ncritical restraint. Film critics don’t write reviews of rough\ncuts. Book critics don’t review non-final manuscripts of novels.</p>\n\n<p>Released software that is labeled “beta” is still released\nsoftware, and is fair game for the same level of criticism as any\nreleased software. You can’t “semi-release” your 1.0 just because\nyou want it out there but aren’t yet finished. Being semi-released\nis like being semi-pregnant. [...]</p>\n\n<p>What exactly is meant by software that is released, but labeled\n“beta”? That there are missing features? <em>All</em> software has\nmissing features. I’ve never met a single developer working on a\nsignificant software project who has completely zeroed out the\nfeatures-to-do list. Knowing how to draw that line between\nfeatures that make it for this release and features postponed for\nlater is a big part of the art of shipping.</p>\n\n<p>No, what “beta” means in this context is “buggy”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Read through to the end, and I even have a badge (courtesy my friend <a href=\"http://bryanbell.com/\">Bryan Bell</a>) that Apple could use <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/06/snell-apple-intelligence-notification-summaries\">to more clearly label</a> Apple Intelligence notification summaries.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/07/beta-is-not-an-excuse-archive\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"847317b871536502f407c0fabcee7ecb049ab451e57f9dbedc9780c011b54127","category":"Tech"}
