{"title":"★ On Apple Fitting a Headset Announcement Into the Always-Packed WWDC Keynote","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2023/05/bajarin_wwdc_headset","date":1684522837000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/benbajarin/status/1659593595643662336-vhv6gL8w\">Ben Bajarin on Twitter</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If Apple is releasing a VR/AR headset this year, it makes more\nsense for a dedicated event or bundle it with a Mac event in\nthe fall.</p>\n\n<p>There is too much ground to cover at WWDC, and 30 min is not\nenough to tell the full product story.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve been thinking about this too. The WWDC keynote is <em>always</em> packed. And in recent years, Federighi has gotten Apple’s software factory into such disciplined shape that there are always major updates to every single platform. There are going to be major new features to announce and demo for iOS/iPadOS 17, MacOS 14, and WatchOS 10. I suspect we’re going to see new Mac hardware announced. If it’s just the 15-inch MacBook Air, that’s an easy announcement: it’s a MacBook Air with a bigger display. But if it’s the M-series Mac Pro (finally), <em>that’s</em> going to demand some presentation time. <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-events-video/id275834665?i=1000565413850\">Last year’s keynote</a> ran 1h:48m; <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23141939/apple-wwdc-2022-biggest-announcements-ios-16-macbook-air-macos-watchos\">here’s a rundown from The Verge</a> of the major announcements.</p>\n\n<p>But I do think the headset is going to be announced at WWDC. There’s just too much smoke for there not to be a fire. And, seemingly, Apple isn’t quietly trying to dampen expectations for the headset behind the scenes. The same thing happened with the iPhone before Macworld Expo 2007 — there were rampant rumors that the Apple phone was finally coming, and no one hearing from sources that it wouldn’t.</p>\n\n<p>Apple does not like for keynotes to run longer than two hours. The glaring exception that springs to mind was the WWDC 2015 keynote, which ran a grueling 2h:25m. That was the one with a long section on Apple Music with Jimmy Iovine on stage. Probably the worst WWDC keynote ever, and the only one that ever felt under-rehearsed.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the thing though: post-COVID keynotes aren’t just pre-recorded, they’re very tightly edited. I suspect we’ll get a keynote that still comes in under 2 hours even with an entire 40-minute-ish segment announcing both the headset and xrOS. It’ll just go fast. Fitting the headset and xrOS developer frameworks into the old-style on-stage WWDC keynote would have posed a problem. I don’t think it’s a problem with the new “keynote movie” format.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-2023-05-19\">1</a></sup> We won’t come out of the keynote thinking it was too long; we’ll come out of it with our heads spinning because it’s going to cover so much, so fast.</p>\n\n<div>\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>And if I’m right, I bet this is one of those years where after the keynote is over, and people start poring over everything Apple puts on the web, we discover a surprising number of very cool iOS and MacOS features that didn’t make it into the keynote. Anything and everything from the OSes might get cut to make time for the headset, xrOS, and Mac hardware announcements. There’s a whole second State of the Union technical keynote in the afternoon where features cut from the main morning keynote can go. <a href=\"#fnr1-2023-05-19\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"09b9e54ad9e1826b11359a44bb821ead11a6b2a9df845840b9e7af98715899b5","category":"Tech"}
