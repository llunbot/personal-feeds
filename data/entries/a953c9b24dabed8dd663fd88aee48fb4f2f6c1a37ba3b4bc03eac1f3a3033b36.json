For households with multiple smart home platforms or different smartphone brands, it means the Matter lights can be controlled from any device. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor Hue Bridge owners who control only Philips Hue lights via Apple's Home app or the Hue app, nothing changes. For Android and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users who own third-party lights with Matter support, they will now be able to set up and control these accessories via the Hue Bridge, provided they own a Matter border router, such as an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> 4K, ‌Apple TV‌ HD (fourth generation), Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nPairing codes for Matter-compatible accessories can be requested in the Hue app by tapping the plus button in the Settings -&gt; Smart Home screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen Matter was officially launched in November 2022, Philips Hue declared itself a supporter of the new smart home standard. At the time, parent company Signify said a software update that would bring compatibility to its Philips Hue lineup would be available to all users in the first quarter of 2023, but the update was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/philips-hue-delays-matter-support-update/\">delayed</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple added support for Matter on the ‌iPhone‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and ‌Apple TV‌ with iOS 16.1, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a>, and tvOS 16.1 last year, with a ‌HomePod‌ or ‌Apple TV‌ required to control Matter accessories in the Home app or with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/philips-hue/\">Philips Hue</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/matter/\">Matter</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/philips-hue-matter-update-now-available/\">Philips Hue Bridge Matter Support Update Now Available</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/philips-hue-bridge-matter-support-update-now-available.2403433/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a953c9b24dabed8dd663fd88aee48fb4f2f6c1a37ba3b4bc03eac1f3a3033b36","category":"Apple"}
