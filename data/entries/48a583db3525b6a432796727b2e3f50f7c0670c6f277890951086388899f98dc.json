{"title":"Pro team history: Alcyon","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-team-history-alcyon","date":1742407259000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-team-history-alcyon\">Pro team history: Alcyon</a></p>\n\n<p>It was approaching half past one on the afternoon of 13th May 1906 when a 20-year-old rider called Marcel Cadolle, who had turned professional just months earlier, sprinted under the finishing banner in Ville d’Avray to claim the 16th edition of the Bordeaux-Paris Classic.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cadolle, who had been in the saddle for 19h 26min, had spent much of the race at the head of affairs before making his move immediately after the control at Dourdan. There, with around 40km to go, he had jumped from his bike and swiftly scribbled on the control sheet before remounting and hurriedly riding away from Henri Cornet and Louis Trousselier, winners of the Tour de France in 1904 and 1905 respectively, and the only riders able to have remained with the young Cadolle.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Here [Cadolle] is already at the foot of the terrible hill that rises up at the exit of the city and where he will play his last card,’ stated Victor Breyer’s report published the next day in <em>L’Auto</em>. ‘In fact, the ex-amateur scales the hill as if the finishing banner is at the top. At the summit a quick glance allows him to see Cornet and Trousselier more than 200 metres away, and there he is, off at full speed on the terrible Dourdan to Versailles leg.’  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cadolle would gain nearly five minutes on Cornet and nearly 15 minutes on Trousselier over the final 40km.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘What an admirable display of energy the winner gives here,’ continued Breyer, ‘climbing all these climbs, tumbling dizzyingly down the descents, always going, as if he were heedless of the 20 hours of racing which put lead in his legs, pushing, yelling without respite and without stopping amidst the cheers of a double line of enthusiasts, to rise only once he has crossed the banner which indicates the end of his gigantic raid.’  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cadolle’s win marked a remarkable first few months in the professional ranks for the 20-year-old, who had also finished second in Paris-Roubaix four weeks earlier. But history shows that the 1906 edition of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/oldest-cycling-races\">Bordeaux-Paris</a> is actually more noteworthy for loudly announcing the arrival of a new sponsor within the professional peloton for which Cadolle had just recorded its first major win.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Here is a newcomer, barely two years old, already a happy rival of the oldest and most renowned [brands],’ wrote <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/in-praise-of-tour-de-france-founder-henri-desgrange\">Henri Desgrange</a> of this new outfit. Little did Desgrange know that this ‘newcomer’ would soon come to dominate his most famous race and later perhaps even contribute to the switch to national teams at the Tour.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>From newcomer to conqueror </h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"727\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-143372887-727x970.webp\" alt=\"black and white image of François Faber after winning the tour de france holding flowers\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-143372887-727x970.webp 727w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-143372887-225x300.webp 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-143372887-768x1025.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-143372887-1151x1536.webp 1151w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-143372887-1535x2048.webp 1535w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-143372887-750x1001.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-143372887-1140x1521.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-143372887-scaled.webp 1919w\" /><figcaption>Luxembourg’s François Faber became the first Alcyon rider to win the Tour de France in 1909, a year in which the team won 13 out of the 14 stages.</figcaption><figcaption>Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The sponsor that had secured that Bordeaux-Paris win in 1906 was Alcyon, a brand that had been founded by Edmond Gentil in Neuilly-sur-Seine in the early 1900s. In the late 1800s Gentil had been working for Peugeot, but after falling out with his employer he set up his own company in 1902 manufacturing bicycles, later adding motorcycles to the range. At its peak, Gentil’s bicycle production reached some 100,000 units a year.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1905 Alcyon entered the professional peloton and one year later was sponsoring a squad that, as well as Cadolle, included notable riders such as Hippolyte Aucouturier (two-time winner of Paris-Roubaix in 1903 and 1904) and Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq (third in the 1905 Tour de France and the rider who, three months after Cadolle’s Bordeaux-Paris win, would bring Alcyon its first Tour stage win). By 1907 the team had added both Trousselier and Eugène Christophe, and 12 months later recorded a suite of impressive spring victories, claiming Milan-San Remo, Paris-Roubaix and Bordeaux-Paris in the space of six weeks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was in 1909 that the team first showed its dominance at the Tour de France. The previous year Marcel Godivier had been the team’s best rider, recording two fourth-placed stage finishes and finishing ninth overall in a race that Alcyon’s rival, Peugeot, had ruled, winning with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-history-petit-breton-makes-it-two-tour-titles\">Lucien Petit-Breton</a>. So Alcyon raided Gentil’s former employer, bringing François Faber and Gustave Garrigou, second and fourth for Peugeot respectively in 1908, into its ranks.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result was transformative. Alcyon won 13 out of 14 stages at the 1909 Tour (only Constant Menager’s Stage 9 win for Le Globe prevented an Alcyon clean sweep) and took the top five places overall, with Faber, nicknamed ‘The Giant from Colombes’, claiming the win in Paris. Alcyon would also go on to win the next three Tours as well, with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-history-lapize-tames-the-pyrenees\">Octave Lapize</a>, Garrigou and Odile Defraye winning in 1910, 1911 and 1912 respectively. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notable wins in other races continued: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-henri-pelissier\">Henri Pélissier</a> winning Lombardia (1913); Marcel Buysse taking the second edition of the Tour of Flanders (1914); Louis Mottiat and René Vermandel (twice) claiming Liège-Bastogne-Liège (1921, 1923 and 1924); Émile Masson winning GP Wolber (1923); Félix Sellier claiming Paris-Roubaix (1925); as well as multiple stages at the Tour and Giro, to name a handful.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+8\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-8-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t until 1927 that Alcyon returned to the Tour’s top step with Nicolas Frantz. Twelve months on, in a Tour that was for the most part held as a series of time-trials, Alcyon swept the podium with Frantz holding the yellow jersey from start to finish. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When, on 28th July 1929, Maurice De Waele rode into Paris as the third successive Alcyon winner of the Tour, the dubious circumstances of his win prompted Desgrange to rethink how his flagship race should be run. De Waele had fallen ill in the Alps – according to <em>Le Miroir des Sports</em> he was only able to digest 300g of sugar and a cup of water before tackling the Galibier – but his team (and others) protected him, blocking the road, reducing the pace and pushing him when commissaires looked elsewhere.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We cut off our arms to help him save the jersey,’ La Française rider Marcel Bidot said. But the Tour was meant to be ridden individually, collaboration forbidden. Desgrange was furious, declaring, ‘My race has been won by a corpse. Why were his opponents so ineffective? What to think of their tactics and the real value of the winner?’  </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/oldest-cycling-races\">The oldest cycling races and how they’ve changed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/remembering-herman-vanspringel\">Remembering Herman Vanspringel, ‘Monsieur Bordeaux-Paris’</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-history-petit-breton-makes-it-two-tour-titles\">Tour de France history: Petit-Breton makes it two Tour titles in 1908</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-history-the-return-of-the-trade-teams\">Tour de France history: The return of the trade teams in 1962</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-tour-de-france-winner-louison-bobet-sealed-his-legend\">How Tour de France winner Louison Bobet sealed his legend</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>In part a reaction to what had happened, two months later <em>L’Auto</em> announced that the 1930 race would be contested by national and regional squads. The race would still be won by an Alcyon rider – André Leducq – albeit riding for France. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-history-the-return-of-the-trade-teams\">Trade teams would not return to the Tour for 32 years</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of more than half a century, Alcyon riders claimed every major <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Classic</a>, including 14 Paris-Roubaix wins – half of those coming in the 1930s alone. As well as those already mentioned, other notable riders who wore Alcyon’s famous jersey included Gaston Rebry, Romain Maes, Sylvère Maes, Paul Maye and Albéric ‘Briek’ Schotte, who won numerous races for the team, including both the Tour of Flanders and World Championships in 1948.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the last word should go to Georges Speicher, who in 1933 and while on Alcyon’s books, became the first rider to win both the Tour and the Worlds in the same year. If that doesn’t seem very impressive given that the World Championships were not introduced into the calendar until 1927, consider that it was a feat not repeated for more than 20 years (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-tour-de-france-winner-louison-bobet-sealed-his-legend\">Louison Bobet</a>, 1954).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘A champion can win everything,’ ran a headline in <em>Paris-Soir </em>in the days following those 1933 Worlds, ‘and Speicher is one.’  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over its long history, Alcyon boasted many of them. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-team-history-alcyon\">Pro team history: Alcyon</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"48a583db3525b6a432796727b2e3f50f7c0670c6f277890951086388899f98dc","category":"Cycling"}
