Apple is working on new M4 versions of the 13-inch and 15-inch ‌MacBook Air‌ models, as well as a new version of the 10.9-inch ‌iPad‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/m2-macbook-air-new-blue.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/15/m4-macs-and-new-ipads-at-next-apple-event/\">expected to refresh</a> the MacBook Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> in October of this year, and it would make sense for a new low-cost ‌iPad‌ to be introduced alongside those devices. Panel shipments that start in October suggest that the low-cost ‌iPad‌ would not be ready for an October event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the ‌MacBook Air‌, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> has said that new models with M4 chips <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/09/when-to-expect-m4-macbook-air-mac-studio-mac-pro/\">will come out </a> in the first quarter of 2025, and on Twitter, he added that the October display shipment timing sounds correct for a Q1 launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>This timing lines up for the MacBook Air, which is now scheduled for calendar Q1. January - March. <a href=\"https://t.co/PeiR2WLHDN\">https://t.co/PeiR2WLHDN</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/05qJCCon29\">https://t.co/05qJCCon29</a></p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1836823803240010161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 19, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe October panel shipment timing is unusual for the ‌iPad‌, so we will need to see what Apple has planned in the coming months. Rumors right now suggest that we can count on an October event that features at least some new Macs and iPads. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/display-shipments-macbook-air-ipad-october/\">Display Shipments for M4 MacBook Air and Low-Cost iPad Expected to Start in October</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/display-shipments-for-m4-macbook-air-and-low-cost-ipad-expected-to-start-in-october.2437070/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4d3dba1547a2998c07f27c1fe416957d3be41c241c085311ae5ed1704efe4a3f","category":"Apple"}
