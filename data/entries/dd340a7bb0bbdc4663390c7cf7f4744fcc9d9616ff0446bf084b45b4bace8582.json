So, I’m sure that this sponsor match we will excel together.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deceuninck’s move to sponsor Alpecin-Fenix comes after three years spent as a title sponsor of the team currently known as Deceuninck-QuickStep. The move represents a step down to the second division, but Alpecin-Fenix has finished as the highest ranked ProTeam by a huge margin for two years running, thus guaranteeing them entry into all WorldTour races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team currently known as Deceuninck-QuickStep, which races at the WorldTour level, has faced uncertainty at times over the past few seasons as Lefevere has sought financial security for the squad with sponsorship commitments. Deceuninck’s departure, however, coincides with a longterm deal with QuickStep floors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Deceuninck bows out, the squad will add one of QuickStep’s products to its name, becoming QuickStep-Alpha Vinyl.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lefevere addressed the news in an interview with <a href=\"https://sporza.be/nl/2021/11/30/patrick-lefevere-over-deceuninck-ik-heb-er-absoluut-geen-probleem-mee~1638298439860/\" target=\"_blank\">Sporza</a>, expressing that he did not take any issue with the move to a different Belgian cycling team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When that term is over and if two parties decide not to continue together, then everyone is free to do what they want,” he said. “I have absolutely no problem with it and I wouldn’t know why I should blame anyone.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/11/deceuninck-signs-on-to-sponsor-alpecin-fenix/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"dd340a7bb0bbdc4663390c7cf7f4744fcc9d9616ff0446bf084b45b4bace8582","category":"Cycling"}
