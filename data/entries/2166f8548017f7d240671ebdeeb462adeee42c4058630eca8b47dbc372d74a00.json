Michael Smith, 52, allegedly used AI to create hundreds of thousands of fake songs by nonexistent bands, then streamed them using bots to collect royalties from platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.</p>\n\n<p>While the AI-generated element of this story is novel, Smith allegedly broke the law by setting up an elaborate fake listener scheme. The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/north-carolina-musician-charged-music-streaming-fraud-aided-artificial-intelligence\">announced the charges</a>, which include wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. If convicted, Smith could face up to 20 years in prison for each charge.</p>\n<p>Smith's scheme, which prosecutors say ran for seven years, involved creating thousands of fake streaming accounts using purchased email addresses. He developed software to play his AI-generated music on repeat from various computers, mimicking individual listeners from different locations. In an industry where success is measured by digital listens, Smith's fabricated catalog reportedly managed to rack up billions of streams.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047451#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047451&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2166f8548017f7d240671ebdeeb462adeee42c4058630eca8b47dbc372d74a00","category":"Tech"}
