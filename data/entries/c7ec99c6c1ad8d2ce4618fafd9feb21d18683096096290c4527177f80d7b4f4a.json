Unfortunately, most of them are for PCs, but there are a lot of Apple-related products at CES, some of them more interesting than others. Fortunately, you don’t have to scour the show floor to find them, because we’ve listed the most interesting one for Apple users right here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a broader interest in CES, you can turn to our sister publication, PCWorld, and its <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/ces\">complete coverage of CES</a> (which is very PC centric). But if you’re only interested in the best stuff Apple users will care about, read on.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>LG UltraFine 32U990A 6K monitor</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/LG-screenshot.png?w=1200\" alt=\"LG UltraFine 6K Display\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>LG</p></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Production-minded users will want to pay attention to this new <a href=\"https://www.ces.tech/ces-innovation-awards/2025/lg-ultrafine-6k-monitor-model-32u990a/\">LG Ultrafine 32-inch display</a>–it not only offers a 6K resolution, but it also supports Thunderbolt 5, which means Macs with a M4 Pro or higher chip can take advantage of Thunderbolt 5’s 120Gbps bandwidth. Surprisingly, it uses a Nano IPS Black panel (instead of OLED) with a wide color gamut covering 99.5 percent of Adobe RGB and 98 percent of DCI-P3. Apple works closely with LG on its displays, so this could be a preview of the new Pro Display XDR rumored to arrive later this year.

Maybe you’re tired of doing that, or maybe you have accessibility issues that complicate this unconscious task. With the <a href=\"https://get.autokeybo.com/\">AutoKeybo</a>, the keyboard and input devices switch for you when a built-in camera sees your simple gesture. The top switchable shelf has a full-sized keyboard while the bottom shelf has a keypad and your mouse or trackpad. Imagine that—a keyboard and trackpad for your Mac that’s actually magic.

Its small size makes it ideal for use with an iPhone when shooting video, especially if you’re using the ProRes format, which creates large files and quickly takes up storage space. If offers transfer speeds up to 1050MBps.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>ESR HaloLock MagMouse Wireless Mouse</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/MagMouse.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"ESR MagMouse\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>ESR</p></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re always losing your mouse, The <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lV_DgCAnEYV8oQupxHc9PfBxnFExJyD1Ac7Tdi8xz78/edit?tab=t.0\">MagMouse</a> from iPhone case maker ESR has a base that you can attach to any surface, like a MacBook or a Mac Pro, and when you want to store the MagMouse, you can place it on the base and it magnetically attaches.

The main reason is the five bold colors it comes in— powder blue, sandbox, fresh yellow, pepper, and lavender—but it’s also the funky camera grip-inspired design that “combines the functionality of a high-capacity power bank with the practicality of an ergonomic phone grip.” It also features a 10,000 mAh battery, 7.5W magnetic wireless charging, a retractable USB-C charging, cable, and a tiny LED screen to show battery percentage. When attached to the back of the phone it looks something like an old-school point-and-shoot camera and even has a built-in shutter for quick picture taking.
