Yet, once a cyclist, always a cyclist, and Eric is offering up his famed Campagnolo knife called the Campag Cutter ($350) right now in a limited batch. Made from a Campagnolo headset wrench and bottom bracket spanner, these knives are formed and sharpened to fit in a custom-made sheath. It’s rare that Eric has these, so if you’re into this idea, act now at <a href=\"https://www.wintercutlery.com/product/campag-cutter-limited-run-package-/198\" target=\"_blank\">Winter Cutlery</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/campagnolo-knife/\">Winter Cutlery Campagnolo Knife</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"68a0a2379de37a68a99742aad78a3a45148c3421520ab61cdb7bbda9ffa56ab0","category":"Cycling"}
