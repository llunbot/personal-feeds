In contrast, the iPhone 16 Pro will use the same 48-megapixel custom Sony IMX803 sensor as that found on the current iPhone 15 Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe leaker also claims that this year's iPhone 16 Pro models will feature an upgraded Ultra Wide camera with a 48-megapixel sensor, allowing it to capture more light and result in better photos when shooting in 0.5x mode, especially in low-light conditions. The Ultra Wide lens on the current iPhone 15 Pro models is 12-megapixels.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is the second time we have heard rumors that the iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature a more advanced main camera sensor. The claim was first made in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/iphone-16-pro-max-to-feature-advanced-main-sensor/\">January</a> by \"Digital Chat Station,\" a Weibo user responsible for leaking several accurate details about upcoming iPhone camera technology. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latter source said that the custom Sony IMX903 in the iPhone 16 Pro Max would include advanced features like a stacked design for better performance, a 14-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) for high-quality image data conversion, and Digital Gain Control (DCG) for better dynamic range and noise control. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have also previously heard rumors of a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera coming to both iPhone 16 Pro models. The rumor first originated last <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/iphone-16-pro-rumored-to-feature-48mp-ultra-wide/\">December</a> from Weibo user \"Instant Digital,\" suggesting that this year's Pro devices will be the first to feature two 48-megapixel sensors. If true, the upgrade should mean that both ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models will be able to shoot 48-megapixel ProRAW photos in Ultra Wide mode.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\nToday's claim doubles down on the rumor and further corroborates a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/\">2023 forecast</a> from Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu, who said that the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ will feature a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2025, the iPhone 17 Pro is expected to complete the rear camera array's transition to 48-megapixel sensors, bringing the technology to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto-lens-rumor/\">Telephoto lens</a>, which is currently 12-megapixels on the iPhone 15 Pro models.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/09/10-reasons-to-wait-iphone-17/\">10 Reasons to Wait for Next Year's iPhone 17</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nApple's upcoming iPhone 16 series is expected to be released around mid-September this year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/iphone-16-pro-dual-48mp-cameras/\">iPhone 16 Pro Max to Feature New 48MP Wide and Ultra Wide Cameras</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-max-to-feature-new-48mp-wide-and-ultra-wide-cameras.2426995/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"824c8562afd5b460cecbb6055ac1a5cc1a43f1c7653ab002d62ff879a22c6294","category":"Apple"}
