I want to open this week's report with a hearty congratulations to Rocket Lab for the company's 50th launch since Electron's debut in 2017. This is a fine achievement for a company founded in New Zealand, a country with virtually no space program.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

On Thursday, <a href=\"https://x.com/RocketLab/status/1803870728753942737\">Rocket Lab launched its 50th Electron mission</a>, \"No Time Toulouse.\"  The mission successfully deployed five Internet-of-Things satellites for the French company Kinéis. This is a nice milestone for the company founded by Peter Beck in New Zealand. With this mission, Rocket Lab becomes the fastest company to go from one launch to 50 launches of a privately developed rocket, surpassing even SpaceX. The company's first Electron mission came about seven years ago.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032510#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032510&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e2142c516334ef7d2e44062c59fadfa61e6b731f872d1fa6395d57fc39ecf220","category":"Tech"}
