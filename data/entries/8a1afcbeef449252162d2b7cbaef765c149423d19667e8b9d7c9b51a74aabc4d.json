All of these deals are live on Microsoft's website, but Amazon is concurrently matching or exceeding many of them. We also have Apple's AirPods Pro still on sale, matching its lowest prices tracked. As always, we use tracking sites like <a href=\"https://camelcamelcamel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CamelCamelCamel</a> and <a href=\"https://keepa.com/#!\" target=\"_blank\">Keepa</a> to compare current sale prices to the typical street price to ensure the sales we find are good deals, too.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JgnWMW\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Surface Pro 9</a> 13-inch tablet PC from <strong>$961</strong> ($1,100)</h3>\n<p> The Surface Pro 9 is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/review-surface-pro-9-makes-some-things-better-without-screwing-most-things-up/\" target=\"_blank\">the best tablet-laptop</a> on the market. It uses a backlit detachable keyboard cover and is optimized with a digital pen (the Surface Pen). It's lightweight and has a smaller footprint than most 2-in-1 laptops while packing enough power to edit media and handle light gaming at higher configurations.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JgnWMW\" target=\"_blank\">Surface Pro 9</a> (Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD) is currently on sale for $961. That's just under $100 less than the current entry point for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3nVfJVD\" target=\"_blank\">Apple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro</a> with 128 GB of storage, and more than $200 less than the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3UnBwBA\">256GB iPad Pro</a>. If you need to step up performance, you can double the RAM (16GB) and swap in Intel's Evo i7 processor for $1,400, typically $1,600. Doubling storage on that model will run you $1,600 currently, down from its usual $1,900 price.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930480#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930480&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8a1afcbeef449252162d2b7cbaef765c149423d19667e8b9d7c9b51a74aabc4d","category":"Tech"}
