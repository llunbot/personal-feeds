This week, it's the turn of a related model, built on the same vehicle architecture: BMW's new X2 crossover, or \"Sports Activity Coupe\" in BMW-speak. As we'll find out, the BMW shares more than one trait with the Countryman JCW.</p>\n<p>BMW had an array of X2 M35is, all painted the same \"Frozen Tampa Bay\" shade of green, which starts in the US at $51,400. There's a less-powerful $42,000 X2 xDrive28i coming here as well, but North American customers will not be offered the battery-electric iX2—BMW's product planners evidently didn't think importing the diminutive EV would be profitable. Outside the US, BMW expects 1 in 5 X2s to be electric.</p>\n<p>The first-generation X2 (and the more upright-looking X1) were divisive cars even by BMW standards. The new one is slightly bigger than before, at 179.3 inches (4,554 mm) long, 72.6 inches (1,844 mm) wide, and 62.6 inches (1,590 mm) tall. That translates to more rear legroom and more cargo volume at the back, but it's not a massive machine—a touch bigger than the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/07/the-2019-audi-q3-is-a-compelling-crossover-point-of-entry-to-the-brand/\">Audi Q3</a> but a bit smaller than a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/01/the-2020-mercedes-benz-glb-gets-good-infotainment-but-dont-get-the-ai/\">Mercedes-Benz GLB</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006250#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006250&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
