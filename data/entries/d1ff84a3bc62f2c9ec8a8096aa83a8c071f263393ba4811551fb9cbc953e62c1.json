All of those cat videos have to be stored somewhere, and DNA is a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/04/microsoft-experiments-with-dna-storage-1000000000-tb-in-a-gram/\">great storage medium</a>; it has amazing data density and is stable over millennia.</p>\n<p>To date, people have encoded information into DNA the same way nature has, by linking the four nucleotide bases comprising DNA—A, T,  C, and G—into a particular genetic sequence. Making these sequences is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/researchers-build-a-metadata-based-image-database-using-dna-storage/\">time-consuming and expensive</a>, though, and the longer your sequence, the higher chance there is that errors will creep in.</p>\n<p>But DNA has an added layer of information encoded on top of the nucleotide sequence, known as epigenetics. These are chemical modifications to the nucleotides, specifically altering a C when it comes before a G. In cells, these modifications function kind of like stage directions; they can tell the cell when to use a particular DNA sequence without altering the “text” of the sequence itself. A new paper in Nature describes using epigenetics to store information in DNA without needing to synthesize new DNA sequences every time.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/how-can-you-write-data-to-dna-without-changing-the-base-sequence/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/how-can-you-write-data-to-dna-without-changing-the-base-sequence/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Diana Gitig","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d1ff84a3bc62f2c9ec8a8096aa83a8c071f263393ba4811551fb9cbc953e62c1","category":"Tech"}
