Both the men’s and women’s races include multiple sections on Tuscany’s famous white roads, which give the race its name.</p>\n<p>Both finish with the spectacularly steep climb to the Piazza del Campo in Siena. This includes sections of the Via Santa Caterina, which enters the ancient city and ramps up to a leg-busting 16 per cent gradient.</p>\n<p>The last few races have been in dry conditions, which raises plumes of chalk dust as the riders traverse the <i>sterrato </i>white road sections. If things turn wet, it can lead to epic conditions like those in which Tiesj Benoot won caked in mud in 2018.</p>\n<p>Here’s how to see the action – wet or dry – live on TV, streaming online or on catch-up.</p>\n<h2>2023 Strade Bianche race schedule and favourites</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The women’s route includes eight <em>strada bianca</em> sections.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The women’s race starts at 11.30am CET and includes eight <em>strada bianca</em> sections, totalling more than 30km of the 136km course.</p>\n<p>There are 24 women’s teams of seven riders taking part. This includes the 17 Women’s WorldTour teams, plus seven wildcards.</p>\n<p>Last year, the race was won by Belgium’s Lotte Kopecky, who out-sprinted <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/annemiek-van-vleutens-canyon-aeroad-cfr/\">Annemiek van Vleuten</a> on the final approach to the finish line.</p>\n<p>Having missed out last year, van Vleuten will be looking to take a third title in this, her final season before retirement.</p>\n<p>This could see her join Fabian Cancellara as only the second rider to have won three editions of Strade Bianche and have a marker in her honour placed on a <em>strada bianca</em> segment.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The men’s race includes 63km of gravel roads.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The men’s race covers 184km and takes in 11 off-road sections, totalling 63km. This includes two sections over 11km in length; the shortest is just 800m.</p>\n<p>All 18 UCI Men’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour teams</a> will be represented at the 2023 Strade Bianche, plus there are seven wildcard teams including recently demoted Israel-Premier Tech and Lotto Dstny. That makes a total of 25 taking to the start line, with seven riders in each team.</p>\n<p>Last year’s winner was Tadej Pogačar, who won from a solo break with 50km to go. This year, he’s opted for a last-minute schedule switch to Paris-Nice, which starts on the next day.</p>\n<p>Fresh from his win in the cyclocross world championships, Mathieu van der Poel, who won in 2021, or his eternal rival Wout van Aert, the 2020 winner, should be hot favourites.</p>\n<h2>How can I watch Strade Bianche 2023 live in the UK?</h2>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Strade Bianche is a chaotic, exciting and (usually) oh-so-dusty highlight of the racing calendar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP via Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Eurosport will show live coverage of both the men’s and women’s editions of the 2023 Strade Bianche.
