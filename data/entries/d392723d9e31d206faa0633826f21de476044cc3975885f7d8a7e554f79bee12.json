This can be distracting, as it overrides other local features that would likely be of greater interest. Perhaps you were trying to find a Five Guys restaurant once, and now you seem to be followed by them wherever you navigate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google lets you remove these shared listings but finding the location isn’t easy at all.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-shared-map-google-map-typewriters-bordered.png?w=1022\" alt=\"shared google maps\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-shared-map-google-map-typewriters-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1183w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-shared-map-google-map-typewriters-bordered.png?resize=256%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 256w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-shared-map-google-map-typewriters-bordered.png?resize=768%2C902&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-shared-map-google-map-typewriters-bordered.png?resize=1022%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1022w\" width=\"1022\" height=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>You can navigate deeply in the Google Maps app to disable showing shared locations for each map you’ve essentially “subscribed” to.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Google Maps app in iOS or iPadOS:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Tap the Saved icon at the bottom of the main view.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap the Maps icon in the main view.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select a shared map.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>View Map Legend</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap any checked item to remove it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no way to unshare these locations within the app. However, you can navigate to the right spot in a browser and remove them from your list of Maps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Google’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/?hl=en&amp;xcust=1-1-1972583-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">My Maps</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click the <em>Not Owned</em> link in the top navigation list.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hover over a map and click the vertical three-dot icon ⫶ and then choose <em>Remove from View</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-google-maps-removed-nonowned-browser-bordered.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Google Maps removed nonowned browser bordered\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-google-maps-removed-nonowned-browser-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1682w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-google-maps-removed-nonowned-browser-bordered.png?resize=300%2C99&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-google-maps-removed-nonowned-browser-bordered.png?resize=768%2C254&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-google-maps-removed-nonowned-browser-bordered.png?resize=1200%2C397&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-google-maps-removed-nonowned-browser-bordered.png?resize=1536%2C508&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"397\" /><figcaption><p>Use a Web browser to navigate to Google’s My Maps and remove maps you no longer want to appear as even an option in your Google Maps app.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Lynn.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
