Now you’re riding the Tour de France Femmes. Is your physio work now part-time or still full-time?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Natalie Grinczer: It’s part-time, I’m balancing both. I was going to say that physio is my trade and cycling is my hobby, but I think it probably takes too much time to be just a hobby!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does that work in terms of structure? Can you plan shifts around riding a race?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I’m contracted for X number of hours per week and per month. I’m so lucky that my work is flexible. I present them with when I’m in the country and all my shifts are concentrated in that space, because I wouldn’t have enough annual leave otherwise. Although I’m not full-time, it feels that way sometimes. I’m in admission prevention so I work in the community and it’s a lot of elderly care and long-term disability, not sports-related.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to eventually work as a sports physio, as I know what athletes need. At the moment I just need to concentrate on me and not other athletes, as we’re quite demanding. It’s nice to have patients that I can chat to about things unrelated to sport. It gets a bit hectic with the travelling though, I can tell you that. One time, I think last year, I landed back from Switzerland for an eight-hour shift and my dad had to drive me straight there from the airport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>With work as a physio and training, how do all of these things slot together?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our rota system at work is shifts from either 8am to 4pm, or 12pm to 8pm. When I’m doing shifts, training will either be two or three hours of polarised training either side and my days off in the week are used for longer training days. It keeps me on the straight and narrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you relax? When is your downtime?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When everything’s done and I’ve eaten, it’s about 8pm and I just lie down. I don’t see my friends, though I’m lucky that my parents live five minutes away. It’s fine when it’s going well, but you can imagine when you might have a bad race, then it’s a double-edged sword.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mid-season moves don’t happen very often. How did yours come to fruition – moving from the French Continental team Stade Rochelais Charente-Maritime to Lifeplus-Wahoo?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the team I was on, we only found out just after Nationals that they were having financial difficulties. We were told to start looking elsewhere for 2024 as they couldn’t fund our racing for the rest of the season. I’d just done all this racing from January to June and was experiencing a really nice race block. Then it was nothing. That was stressful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom [Varney, Lifeplus-Wahoo boss] contacted me just regarding any thoughts for 2024, so we were generally talking about that beforehand. Then when I found out about the shortfall of my previous team, I messaged him to let him know the situation and asked whether there were any opportunities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was also reaching out to other teams but it was really bad timing as it was near the start of the Giro d’Italia Donne so everyone was away and no one was responding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You raced the Tour de France Femmes last year. Minus the team change, what is the biggest difference for you now going into the second edition?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s quite sudden as Stade Rochelais Charente-Maritime weren’t racing the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a>. We didn’t recon any of the courses. I can see the road book and profiles, but I hadn’t physically covered any of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\" target=\"_blank\">the stages</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even just to be here is lucky in my eyes. I had some quite nice results in the first half of the year, and some of the riders that were in our 1.1 races are here in France, so it’ll be interesting to see how I’ll fare. I know what to expect because it’s the biggest race of the year and everyone goes in there really hot. In terms of results? Honestly, I can’t say. I’ll just try and take whatever results that come.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/back-where-it-belongs-inside-the-tour-de-france-femmes\">Back where it belongs: inside the Tour de France Femmes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-favourites\">Who are the favourites for the 2023 Tour de France Femmes?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/british-riders-tour-de-france-femmes\">Who are the 10 British riders at the Tour de France Femmes 2023?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\">Tour de France Femmes 2023: Everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p><strong>How would you describe your riding style?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I worked quite a lot on short, high power efforts to be able to make splits this year. It worked. I’m not coached – I just like to do different training and see how that translates. Apart from the Tour de Normandie Féminin, which wasn’t really a race for that, I have managed to be in the first 25 in every race I’ve been in since January. I’ve been making the splits but then, being on a smaller team, maybe no one’s expecting me to do anything necessarily. I just need to be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess it’s that progression to the point of saying, ‘OK, I’ve been in this situation before. What opportunities are about? What can I do now?’ Instead of maybe being a bit conservative, being open to taking a bit more risks is important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is that one of your goals for yourself in terms of personal development?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I think it’s about once you’ve cracked getting into that small group, you’re just in a smaller race, aren’t you? It’s just a different race situation. It’s about being confident enough to try some things out. If it doesn’t work out, try something else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is there a stage or an opportunity with the team that you’re looking forward to during this Tour de France Femmes? Or is it more embracing every moment as it comes?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes it’s like that, especially after last year. I’m not going to take each day for granted. I’m definitely not going to hide away until tomorrow because your race can be taken away at any moment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting into a lone breakaway is not what I’m looking for, rather just taking that initiative each day and looking for opportunities, helping out teammates and working for our goals. Trying to excel every day to the best of what I can do is what I’m trying to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And Lifeplus-Wahoo have gifted <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/watch-tour-de-france-femmes-free-gcn\" target=\"_blank\">10,000 free GCN+ passes</a> to watch this year’s Tour de France Femmes as well.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. It makes it more accessible to people who don’t want to subscribe for a year for something they may not use again. We really <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-tour-de-france-femmes\" target=\"_blank\">need people to see</a> what we’re doing to increase the sponsorship, the interest, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you were going to skip ahead two years, where would you like to be in your in your career, either on or off the bike?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ooo, that’s difficult to say. I would like to have at least one year, give it a good crack being full time in WorldTour races and go from there. In the future, I would like to do some DS work, or notable physio or biomechanics work. As a rider, I’d really like to experience the highest level and have a bit more time to look into all the details. Especially time-trialling or riding at altitude so I feel like it’s a bit more level when I go to the start line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m just grateful that Lifeplus-Wahoo had a space for me. It was such a stressful time and it just fits so well. I’m really looking forward to the next half of the season and what kind of opportunities present themselves. A few weeks ago, I certainly didn’t think I’d be riding the Tour de France Femmes.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/lifeplus-wahoo-natalie-grinczer\">‘I’m not going to take each day for granted’: Q&amp;A with Lifeplus-Wahoo’s Natalie Grinczer</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"46fd45e8358154ef1ee51becd8c784a8a880bcc07c16f03194a4731100beac8b","category":"Cycling"}
