That is the hard-to-believe plan from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/nothing-phone-2-hands-on-pro-repair-styling-without-the-functionality/\">upstart phone manufacturer</a> \"Nothing,\" which says the new \"<a href=\"https://us.nothing.tech/pages/nothing-chats\">Nothing Chats</a>\" will allow users to use \"iMessage on Android\" complete with a blue bubble sent to all their iPhone friends.</p>\n<p>Nothing Chat will be powered by Sunbird, an app developer that has claimed to be able to send iMessage chats for about a year now, with no public launch. According to a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/14/imessage-on-android-nothing-sunbird/\">Washington Post</a> article with quotes from the CEOs of Nothing and Sunbird, Nothing will \"start\" rolling out \"an early version\" of Nothing Chats with iMessage compatibility on Friday. The only catch, supposedly, is that you'll need a Nothing Phone 2.</p>\n<p>Is this for real or a publicity stunt? Apple is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/epic-deposition-shows-how-differently-google-and-apple-treat-messaging/\">on record</a> saying that iMessage on Android would only serve to weaken Apple, and it doesn't want to do that. Surely, any Android OEM offering \"iMessage\" support would immediately have the project shut down by Apple.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983702#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983702&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a0281ddb830636c7e41ecd00efa1b9792a480fe37a4f6595b1487dc3c98a6236","category":"Tech"}
