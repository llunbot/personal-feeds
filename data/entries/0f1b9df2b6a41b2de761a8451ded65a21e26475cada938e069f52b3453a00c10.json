Introducing the M4 chip in an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> and only six months after the previous chip generation would be unprecedented moves, but there is evidence to suggest that it is a plausible possibility. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/will-the-new-ipad-pro-really-have-m4/\">Will the New iPad Pro Really Have the M4 Chip?</a></li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's \"Let loose\" event is expected to focus on the unveiling of redesigned ‌iPad Pro‌ models with OLED displays, two new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> models, a high-end Magic Keyboard accessory, and a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>.
