It was a long way, but as with so many jobs, occasional travel was the cost of doing business. That was true especially when your business was robbing people of their cryptocurrency by breaking into their homes and threatening to cut off their balls and rape their wives.</p>\n<p>St. Felix, a young man of just 25, had tried this line of work closer to home at first, but it hadn't gone well. A September 2022 home invasion in Homestead, Florida, was supposed to bring St. Felix and his crew piles of crypto. All they had to do was stick a gun to some poor schlub's head and force him to log in to his online exchange and then transfer the money to accounts controlled by the thieves. A simple planâ€”which worked fine until it turned out that the victim's crypto accounts had far less money in them than planned.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051106#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051106&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"428eac17291c45b9f2095edaff5c2333dee566a0624788bc2088df18bc887b30","category":"Tech"}
