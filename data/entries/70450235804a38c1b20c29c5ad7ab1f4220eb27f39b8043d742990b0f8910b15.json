It almost certainly means that iPadOS 18 would drop support for iPad models powered by the regular A10 Fusion chip, including the sixth-generation and seventh-generation iPads.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe post was spotted by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613\">Aaron Perris</a>, and it has since been deleted. However, this was likely because the account prefers to keep a low profile, and many of its previously-deleted posts contained accurate information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf this rumor is accurate, iPadOS 18 would be compatible with the following iPad models:<ul><li>iPad Pro: 2018 and later</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPad Air: 2019 and later</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPad mini: 2019 and later</li>\r<br />\n<li>iPad: 2020 and later</li></ul>Apple is expected to announce iPadOS 18 at its annual developers conference WWDC in June, and the update should be released to all users with a compatible iPad in September. So far, key new features rumored for the update include <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/\">new generative AI functionality for Siri and more</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/\">RCS support in the Messages app</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe same source also expects iOS 18 to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/ios-18-compatible-iphones-rumor/\">compatible with the same iPhone models as iOS 17</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/ipados-18-compatible-ipads-rumor/\">iPadOS 18 Rumored to Drop Support for These iPad Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-18-rumored-to-drop-support-for-these-ipad-models.2420545/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"70450235804a38c1b20c29c5ad7ab1f4220eb27f39b8043d742990b0f8910b15","category":"Apple"}
