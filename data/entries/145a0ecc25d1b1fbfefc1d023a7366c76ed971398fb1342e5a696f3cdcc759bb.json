The studio released a \"motion poster\" earlier this week set to a moody cover of John Williams' \"Superman March,\" as well as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbE8n146umc\">a teaser</a> for a teaser for the film.

It kinda worked, especially since Superman's dog Krypto makes an adorably welcome appearance.</p>\n<p>Gunn describes his take as less of an origin story and more of a journey, with Superman struggling to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage and aristocratic origins with his small-town, adoptive human family. Gunn tapped David Corenswet to play Clark Kent/Superman, at 25 a bit more established than the young cub reporter of <em>Smallville</em>, for instance. Rachel Brosnahan plays Lois Lane, Skyler Gisondo plays Jimmy Olsen, and Nicholas Holt is arch-nemesis Lex Luther. (Holt's son shaved his head for the role.) Luther's sidekicks are played by Sara Sampaio as Eve Teschmacher and Terence Rosemore as Otis.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/krypto-steals-the-show-in-superman-teaser/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/krypto-steals-the-show-in-superman-teaser/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"145a0ecc25d1b1fbfefc1d023a7366c76ed971398fb1342e5a696f3cdcc759bb","category":"Tech"}
