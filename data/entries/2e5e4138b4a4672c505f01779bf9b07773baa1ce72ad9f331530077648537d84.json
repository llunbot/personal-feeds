And sure enough, iOS 15.2 began its beta test period just a day after iOS 15.1 was released on October 25, 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is typical of these releases, it is first available only to registered developers. The public beta typically follows within a day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New features in iOS 15.2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15_2-release-notes&amp;xcust=1-1-547488-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple’s release notes</a>, iOS 15.2 brings the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/&amp;xcust=1-1-547488-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">App Privacy Report</a>, which is basically a new interface for the <em>Record App Activity</em> feature.
