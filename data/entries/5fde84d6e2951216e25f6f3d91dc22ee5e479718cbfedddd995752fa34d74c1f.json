Upon launching the Paramount+ app on the device, users can select the new environment, which takes them to the familiar setting of Bikini Bottom featuring locations such as SpongeBob's pineapple house, Patrick Star's rock, and Squidward Tentacles' house.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen users start streaming content on Paramount+, the environment adapts.

The character himself appears, sitting down with popcorn.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe update to the Paramount+ app also introduces an interactive game where users can catch jellyfish. By looking at jellyfish and tapping their fingers together, users can catch them with a net that appears on the screen. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nYesterday, Disney+ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/disney-plus-immersive-environment-iceland/\">introduced a new Iceland environment</a> in collaboration with National Geographic, and Apple itself recently added a Lake Vrangla environment, with a Bora Bora option slated for release later in 2024 as part of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/\">visionOS 2</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/\">visionOS 2</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/spongebob-environment-available-on-vision-pro/\">SpongeBob SquarePants Environment Now Available in Paramount+ App on Apple Vision Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spongebob-squarepants-environment-now-available-in-paramount-app-on-apple-vision-pro.2433055/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5fde84d6e2951216e25f6f3d91dc22ee5e479718cbfedddd995752fa34d74c1f","category":"Apple"}
