Starting today, Gemini has a new Canvas feature that lets you draft, edit, and refine documents or code. Gemini is also getting Audio Overviews, a neat capability that first appeared in the company's NotebookLM product, but it's getting even more useful as part of Gemini.</p>\n<p>Canvas is similar (confusingly) to the OpenAI product of the same name. Canvas is available in the Gemini prompt bar on the web and mobile app. Simply upload a document and tell Gemini what you need to do with it. In Google's example, the user asks for a speech based on a PDF containing class notes. And just like that, Gemini spits out a document.</p>\n<p>Canvas lets you refine the AI-generated documents right inside Gemini. The writing tools available across the Google ecosystem, with options like suggested edits and different tones, are available inside the Gemini-based editor. If you want to do more edits or collaborate with others, you can export the document to Google Docs with a single click.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/gemini-gets-new-coding-and-writing-tools-plus-ai-generated-podcasts/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/gemini-gets-new-coding-and-writing-tools-plus-ai-generated-podcasts/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fcc99734cd6353c421f29724fb9dc2af570061bf45a1afddce52b19232455d45","category":"Tech"}
