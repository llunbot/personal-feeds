An approval would also require the Drug Enforcement Administration to reclassify MDMA, which is currently in the DEA's most restricted category, Schedule I, which is defined as drugs \"with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" The category also includes LSD, heroin, and marijuana.</p>\n<p>The public benefit corporation (PBC) that filed the FDA application was created by MAPS, The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which has been supporting this type of work since 1986. The application is based on positive data from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III studies, which were funded and organized by MAPS and MAPS PBC.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991296#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991296&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"270d568e48d7061fbbb2a21f7ae11a4381d7112d9d6773a4f49f4e8638638482","category":"Tech"}
