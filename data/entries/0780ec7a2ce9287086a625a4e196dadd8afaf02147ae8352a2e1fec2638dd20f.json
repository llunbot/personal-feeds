Session Players expand the Drummer capabilities in Logic Pro, with Apple adding a new Bass Player and Keyboard Player, plus a Stem Splitter to extract work with individual parts of a single audio recording.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStem Splitter is designed to allow artists to separate mixed audio into distinct parts: Drums, Bass, Vocals, and Other instruments.
