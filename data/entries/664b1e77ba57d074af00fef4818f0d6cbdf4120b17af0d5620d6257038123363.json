For example, @aaronp613 on X points out that the <a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1929643947678412939?s=46&amp;t=KeNv190kZok_LLb57m5tjg\">WWDC25 hashmoji is now live</a>. In case you’re wondering, it looks like the glossy Apple icon, but it’s interestingly labeled as “BF-14032_WWDC25_HashmojiBefore,” which seems to indicate that there will be another hashmoji after the keynote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More intriguing, however, is a <a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1929688099912638856?s=46&amp;t=KeNv190kZok_LLb57m5tjg\">tidbit</a> posted by @aaronp613, which states that third-party retailers received an email from Apple about “resources to help you talk to customers about what’s possible when hardware and software are designed together.” This can be interpreted in a couple of ways. One way to look at it is tied to the rumored <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2800813/if-you-still-need-convincing-apple-just-confirmed-that-major-ui-changes-are-coming-at-wwdc.html\">new user-interface language</a> that Apple will be implementing throughout its operating systems, and that the company is making a concerted effort to train retailers in the messaging about the changes.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/aaronp613-apple-wwdc-retail.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1188\" alt=\"aaronp613 WWDC25 X post\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/aaronp613-apple-wwdc-retail.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/aaronp613-apple-wwdc-retail.jpg?resize=297%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 297w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/aaronp613-apple-wwdc-retail.jpg?resize=768%2C776&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/aaronp613-apple-wwdc-retail.jpg?resize=1188%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1188w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/aaronp613-apple-wwdc-retail.jpg?resize=1521%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1521w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/aaronp613-apple-wwdc-retail.jpg?resize=2028%2C2048&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2028w\" width=\"1188\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1929643947678412939?s=46&amp;t=KeNv190kZok_LLb57m5tjg\" target=\"_blank\">@aaronp613/X</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to look at it is that Apple is going to release a new hardware device next week and wants to make sure retailers know how to demonstrate it. Could it be the rumored HomeHub or HomePod with an iPad-like display? <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">Reports</a> have said that these devices were on the release schedule for this year, but the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2632155/apples-smart-home-hub-hit-project-by-siri-related-delay.html\">delays with Siri</a> also pushed these products back.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>It’s certainly something to think about until the WWDC25 keynote on Monday at 10 a.m. Pacific, which <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2801430/wwdc-2025-is-ready-to-go-on-youtube.html\">you can watch live</a>.
