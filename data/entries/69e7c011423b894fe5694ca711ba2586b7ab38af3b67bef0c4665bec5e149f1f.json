{"title":"YouTube Premium Quietly Hikes Subscription Prices in the US [Updated]","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/20/youtube-premium-price-hike-us/","date":1689839334000,"content":"Google has quietly increased its YouTube Premium subscription prices for newcomers in the United States (via <em><a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/07/19/youtube-premium-price-increase/\">9to5Google</a></em>).\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/General-YouTube-Feature-1.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nIndividual YouTube Premium subscriptions now cost $13.99 per month, up $2 from the previous $11.99 price. Signing up to a monthly subscription from within the iOS YouTube app has also increased to $18.99, up from $15.99. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnnual plans have gone up from $119.99 to $139.99, introducing a $20 hike, while the student plan has also gone up from $6.99 per month to $7.99 per month. The only plan that is unchanged is the family plan, which is still $22.99 per month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYouTube is also raising the price of Music Premium from $9.99 to $10.99 per month. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle hasn't officially announced the price hikes yet, but the increases are already evident on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/premium\">YouTube's Premium plan sign-up webpage</a>. For non-subscribers, YouTube Premium's 1-month free trial offer is still in place.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPresumably existing subscribers will be informed soon that they will begin paying the new prices at some point, perhaps when their monthly or annual memberships are up for renewal, but we'll have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the United Kingdom and elsewhere, YouTube Premium subscription prices appear to be unchanged - at least for now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYouTube Premium provides ad-free video playback, the ability to play videos while using other apps or while a device's screen is locked, an option to download videos for offline playback, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>Update:</b> YouTube has informed existing subscribers on a month-to-month plan that they will receive at least three months of service at their current price before the price increase goes into effect. Customers are receiving emails about the upcoming price increase, and will be informed again 30 days before the price increase happens.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/\">YouTube</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/20/youtube-premium-price-hike-us/\">YouTube Premium Quietly Hikes Subscription Prices in the US [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtube-premium-quietly-hikes-subscription-prices-in-the-us-updated.2396390/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"69e7c011423b894fe5694ca711ba2586b7ab38af3b67bef0c4665bec5e149f1f","category":"Apple"}
