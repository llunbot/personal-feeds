The news comes as Sonos is expecting to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/app-redesign-blowback-will-cost-sonos-up-to-30-million-ceo-says/\">spend $20 to $30 million</a> in the short term to repair the damage from its poorly received app update.</p>\n<p>In a statement to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220357/sonos-layoffs-august-2024-app\">The Verge</a>, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We made the difficult decision to say goodbye to approximately 100 team members representing 6 percent of the company. This action was a difficult, but necessary, measure to ensure continued, meaningful investment in Sonos’ product roadmap while setting Sonos up for long term success.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sonos reported having 1,844 people in October 2022, per <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/sonos-layoffs-company-cuts-7percent-or-about-130-employees.html\">CNBC</a>. The company also announced layoffs of about 130 people (or 7 percent of its workforce) in June 2023 due to “continued headwinds,” according to Spence. In 2020, Sonos <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1314727/000131472720000032/a8-kitem205filed6x24x2.htm\">laid off</a> 12 percent of employees, which was estimated to be about 174 people.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043533#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043533&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8a0a7d7e3bc9f2675fb5cd6deebd01ec87eab0447110f79db11664e57d156f1c","category":"Tech"}
