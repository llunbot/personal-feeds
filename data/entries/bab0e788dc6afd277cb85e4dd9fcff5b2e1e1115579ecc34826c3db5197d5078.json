The GT-1X and GT-2X are two new Mosaic framesets for riders seeking a big tire, off-road capable titanium adventure bike. Both GT-X frames are designed around a 29×2.25 tire, a gravel-specific or MTB drivetrain, and a geometry that incorporates a longer top tube and shorter stem, allowing the rider to set up their GT-X in a drop bar or flat bar configuration. The addition of optional frame bag and accessory mounts, as well as rack and fender mounts, make the GT-X capable of all-season, all-terrain exploration.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/1-DSC_1253-Edit-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mosaiccycles.com/gt-1x\" target=\"_blank\">The GT-1X</a> utilizes Mosaic’s top-of-the-line, double-butted titanium tubeset. Custom geometry and a rider-specific tubeset are included as “standard” options on GT-1X, making it a truly custom build. The GT-1X is offered in the rider’s choice of Mosaic Paint Layout or the Mosaic Factory Finish.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/6-DSC_1291-Edit-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mosaiccycles.com/gt-2x\" target=\"_blank\">The GT-2X</a> utilizes Mosaic’s simpler straight gauge titanium tubeset. The GT-2X is offered in 7 stock sizes from S-XXL, with custom geometry available as an upgrade. The GT-2X is finished in Mosaic’s standard raw finish, with available upgrade options to a Mosaic Paint Layout or the Mosaic Factory Finish.</p>\n<p>Every GT-X adventure bike is built to order and finished in Mosaic’s Boulder, Colorado facility. Orders can be placed through a Mosaic dealer, and frames carry a 12 week lead time from the date that the details are confirmed, the order is signed off and put into the build queue.</p>\n<p>See more at Mosaic.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"bab0e788dc6afd277cb85e4dd9fcff5b2e1e1115579ecc34826c3db5197d5078","category":"Cycling"}
