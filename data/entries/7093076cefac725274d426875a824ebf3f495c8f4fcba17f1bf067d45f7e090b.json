The new 2025 line-up includes their all-new Women’s Trail &amp; Enduro Apparel line, a new DH &amp; gravity race kit developed with Pivot Factory Racing, and the simple low-cost Ride Kit 1.0 that pairs a set of long-sleeve jersey &amp; pants combined for less than a hundred bucks for kids or adults…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 Leatt expanded mountain bike riding clothing line</h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forgive me, but this is almost gonna seem like a regurgitated marketing press release from a new season of mountain bike riding clothing.

A flexible and supportive waist construction is combined with a 3-layer waterproof and taped seat liner. The result is full freedom of movement as well as complete waterproofing, no matter how muddy the saddle gets. The overall 4-way flex construction has an additional “DeFlextion” reinforcement in the seat area and knee section, making it as comfortable as durable. Storage comes in the form of five zippered pockets, one of which is mesh (from $99 / 109€).</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Like the Trail range, the long and short-sleeved jerseys are made from IceYarn fabric. The prints and colorways are simple and understated, and the finish is super soft for sensitive skin. With laser-cut ventilation and an integrated goggle wiper, these jerseys have all the bases covered at a fair price point (from $65 / 65€).</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Men’s premium Downhill 5.0 line-up</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_Gravity-Line_JakobJewett-photo-by-Bartek-Pawlikowski-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_Gravity-Line_JakobJewett-photo-by-Bartek-Pawlikowski-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Kit, expanded mountain bike riding clothing range, Gravity Pro line\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_Gravity-Line_JakobJewett-photo-by-Bartek-Pawlikowski-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_Gravity-Line_JakobJewett-photo-by-Bartek-Pawlikowski-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_Gravity-Line_JakobJewett-photo-by-Bartek-Pawlikowski-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_Gravity-Line_JakobJewett-photo-by-Bartek-Pawlikowski-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_Gravity-Line_JakobJewett-photo-by-Bartek-Pawlikowski-jpg.webp 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_GravityLine_Bernard-Kerr-photo-by-Bartek-Pawlikowski-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_GravityLine_Bernard-Kerr-photo-by-Bartek-Pawlikowski-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Kit, expanded mountain bike riding clothing range, DH Pro line\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_GravityLine_Bernard-Kerr-photo-by-Bartek-Pawlikowski-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_GravityLine_Bernard-Kerr-photo-by-Bartek-Pawlikowski-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_GravityLine_Bernard-Kerr-photo-by-Bartek-Pawlikowski-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_GravityLine_Bernard-Kerr-photo-by-Bartek-Pawlikowski-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_GravityLine_Bernard-Kerr-photo-by-Bartek-Pawlikowski-jpg.webp 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The 5.0 Gravity models are the result of all of Leatt’s R&amp;D knowledge, plus the experience of the Pivot Factory Racing team. The 5.0 jersey uses state-of-the-art fabric construction technologies – the sleeves are made from a combination of CoWeave and DeFlextion materials. Using a custom-programmed 3D-knit, it has seamless transitions from ventilation areas into reinforcement areas. The sleeves have a tight fit, ideal for aerodynamics, while the torso section is looser to maximize freedom of movement. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The 5.0 Gravity pants also feature a CoWeave and DeFlextion seamless construction in the lower leg. The upper leg is made from a flexible, lightweight 4-way stretch fabric, while the seat area is enhanced with a bonded, waterproof liner. For a perfect fit around the waist, Leatt uses a slimline, lightweight, motocross-inspired Hypalon belt construction. Due to these advanced production techniques and the chosen high-end fabrics, the pants and jerseys aren’t cheap: Pants are $189 / 189€, Jerseys $99 / 99€.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Ride Kit 1.0: ultra-affordable enduro, gravity &amp; DH MTB riding sets</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_Ride-Kit-MTB-1-0-jumping-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_Ride-Kit-MTB-1-0-jumping-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Kit, expanded mountain bike riding clothing range, Ride Kit MYB 1.0\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_Ride-Kit-MTB-1-0-jumping-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_Ride-Kit-MTB-1-0-jumping-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_Ride-Kit-MTB-1-0-jumping-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_Ride-Kit-MTB-1-0-jumping-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_Ride-Kit-MTB-1-0-jumping-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_Ride-Kit-MTB-1-0-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_Ride-Kit-MTB-1-0-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Kit, expanded mountain bike riding clothing range, affordable Ride Kit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_Ride-Kit-MTB-1-0-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_Ride-Kit-MTB-1-0-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_Ride-Kit-MTB-1-0-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_Ride-Kit-MTB-1-0-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_Ride-Kit-MTB-1-0-jpg.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Less than 100 bucks for a jersey and pants set!

The chosen material is still Bluesign-approved, flexible, breathable, and fast-drying. OK, fewer zippers &amp; pockets and a simple moto-style buckle waist closure… but still some laser-cut vent holes and goggle wiper included.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This jersey-pant combo looks and feels way more expensive than it is. The cut and style, featuring minimal branding, makes it great for trail riding, as well. The pants and sleeves come in all black only, and the main body comes in a choice of black, grey, brown, or teal. Recommended retail pricing is: Adults $99 / 99€ and Kids (starting on a body height of 110cm) $89 / 89€ for set of both pants &amp; long-sleeve jersey.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New 5.0 3DF EVO Pads protective gear</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_5-3DF-EVO-Knee-pads-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_5-3DF-EVO-Knee-pads-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Kit, expanded mountain bike riding clothing range, knee protection\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_5-3DF-EVO-Knee-pads-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_5-3DF-EVO-Knee-pads-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_5-3DF-EVO-Knee-pads-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_5-3DF-EVO-Knee-pads-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_5-3DF-EVO-Knee-pads-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_5-3DF-EVO-Knee-pads-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Leatt-MTB-Kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range_photo-by-Richard-Kurowski_5-3DF-EVO-Knee-pads-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(other photos by Richard Kurowski/Leatt)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Leatt’s best-selling pads have been around for 8 years now.

The biggest change has been made to the damping material and its construction, with the introduction of FlexMesh (single density) and FlexMesh Pro (dual-density) padding, a 3D mesh construction. Traditional damping material is heavy and bulky, and has small ventilation holes. Conversely, FlexMesh holes are bigger than the damping material itself, maximizing ventilation (Leatt claims plus 50%) and bringing the weight down by 11%. Flex joints allow for 3D flexing and a comfortable fit. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The hard shells covering the FlexMesh pads are also fully vented, and are available in black and white color options. Prices start at $179 / 189€ for a Chest/Back FlexMesh protector 4.5 Evo, and go up to the maximum protective product, the Body Protector 5.5 Evo (FlexMesh Pro at chest &amp; back, plus additional flanks/rips, shoulder, and elbow protection) retailing at $349 / 379€</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://leatt.com/int/2025mtb\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Leatt.com/2025MTB</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2025-leatt-mtb-kit-expanded-mountain-bike-riding-clothing-range-for-women-men-kids/\">2025 Leatt MTB Gear w/ All-New Women Trail &amp; Enduro line, Affordable Ride Kit 1.0, more…</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"7093076cefac725274d426875a824ebf3f495c8f4fcba17f1bf067d45f7e090b","category":"Cycling"}
