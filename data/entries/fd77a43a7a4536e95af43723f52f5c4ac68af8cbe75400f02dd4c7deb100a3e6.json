The idea of spending time on a turbo trainer, self-flagellating to heavy music while you stared numbingly at a wall, all in pursuit of some intangible fitness gains, seemed like a kind of madness.</p>\n<p>However, thanks to the advent of smart turbo trainers and third-party interactive apps, realising the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/indoor-cycling-benefits/\">benefits of indoor cycling</a> has never been easier or, crucially, more fun.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to invest in an indoor training setup, then you’re in the right place. We’ve put the latest smart trainers through their paces to find out what’s really worth spending your money on.</p>\n<h3>What is a smart trainer?</h3>\n<p>Smart trainers are interactive turbo trainers that connect with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-indoor-cycling-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">indoor cycling apps</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/zwift-your-complete-guide/\">Zwift</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/training-software/trainerroad-training-software-review/\">TrainerRoad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/wahoo-systm/\">Wahoo SYSTM</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rgt-cycling-guide/\">RGT Cycling</a>, to control the trainer’s resistance and replicate hills, headwinds and drafting effects inside virtual worlds.</p>\n<p>These apps can also guide you through power-based <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/hiit-interval-training/\">interval workouts</a>, with the resistance automatically adjusting to keep you in the required <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/training-zones/\">training zones</a> (this is known as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/erg-mode/\">ERG mode</a>).</p>\n<p>Today’s smart turbo trainers work by communicating with third-party apps on smartphones, tablets and computers using wireless ANT+ frequencies or Bluetooth.</p>\n<p>It sounds complicated, but most of these trainers and apps will automatically search for and connect to each other with the click of a button, so in practice, it’s usually very simple.</p>\n<h3>Wheel-on or direct drive?</h3>\n<p>There are two main types of smart trainer: <strong>wheel-on</strong> and <strong>direct drive</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Wheel-on smart trainers</h4>\n<p>Wheel-on smart trainers function like classic, ‘dumb’ turbo trainers – you clamp the rear axle into a support while your rear wheel rests on a roller drum. This drum is connected to a resistance unit that communicates with your chosen hardware and app to control the resistance you feel through the wheel.</p>\n<p>These are typically the cheapest and lightest types of smart trainers, but they can cause wear on your tyres (though specific trainer tyres are available to mitigate this issue), their power measurement is generally less accurate and the ride feel often isn’t as good as direct-drive trainers.</p>\n<p>This is most often the noisiest type of indoor trainer, too.</p>\n<h4>Direct drive trainers</h4>\n<p>Direct drive trainers require you to remove the rear wheel and connect your bike to the trainer via a standard cassette. These are heavier and more expensive than wheel-on trainers, but prices are getting more competitive and they have a number of advantages.</p>\n<p>Outside of the obvious one – a lack of wear on your lovely rear tyre – they also tend to be quieter and offer a more realistic, road-like ride feel. They are also usually much more feature-rich and accurate – in terms of power measurement – than wheel-on trainers.</p>\n<p>Of course, price is always going to be a major consideration. So we’ve tested a range of options to suit as many budgets as possible, but there’s no denying these trainers aren’t cheap.</p>\n<p>However, compared to a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road bike groupset</a> upgrade, or even a new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-winter-road-bikes/\">winter road bike</a>, they can offer good value if you want to be able to consistently and enjoyably train indoors.</p>\n<p>Let’s move on to our pick of the best smart trainers out there right now.

It’s a great plug-and-play solution.</p>\n<p>It comes with an 11-speed Shimano 105 cassette installed, and there are adaptors for 142mm thru-axles and a front wheel riser block included in the box, all of which is especially noteworthy at this price point.</p>\n<p>Ride quality is very good, especially considering it doesn’t have the largest flywheel out there, and we were impressed by its stability when really cranking things up.</p>\n<p>It can simulate gradients of up to 15 per cent and has a maximum power of 1,900 watts, so the very strongest riders might find this unit a little under-specced, but for most people, this will be more than they’ll ever need.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/resistance-trainer/elite-suito-review/\">Read our full review of the Elite Suito</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Saris H3</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Saris H3 tops the brand’s range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><b>Type: </b>Direct drive</li>\n<li><b>Maximum power:</b> 2,000 watts</li>\n<li><b>Maximum simulated gradient:</b> 20%</li>\n<li><b>Weight:</b> 21.3kg</li>\n<li><b>Flywheel: </b>9kg</li>\n<li><b>Cassette included:</b> No</li>\n<li><b>Noise: </b>61dB</li>\n<li><b>Price:</b> £749.99 / $1,099.99 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The H3 sits at the top of Saris’s smart trainer range and builds on the popular H2. Reducing the noise levels was one of Saris’s top priorities and it’s certainly achieved good things with the H3 – at just 61dB at 20mph (measured on an iPhone app), it’s very quiet indeed.</p>\n<p>Ride feel is good, with the stout 9kg flywheel contributing to a very realistic experience. At 21.3kg, it’s also a very solid platform, and while this does make it quite hard to move around, Saris has at least included a handle in the design, which makes things considerably easier.</p>\n<p>The H3 is capable of 2,000 watts of power and 20 per cent gradients. Power figures were within the claimed +/- 2 per cent accuracy, which should be more than enough for most riders. At £749.99, it’s also competitively priced, so there’s a lot to like.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/resistance-trainer/saris-h3-review/\">Read our full review of the Saris H3</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Tacx Neo 2T</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tacx’s Neo 2T smart trainer is its top-of-the-range model.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><b>Type:</b> Direct drive</li>\n<li><b>Maximum power:</b> 2,200 watts</li>\n<li><b>Maximum simulated gradient:</b> 25%</li>\n<li><b>Weight:</b> 21.5kg</li>\n<li><b>Flywheel weight:</b> Virtual</li>\n<li><b>Cassette included:</b> No</li>\n<li><b>Noise:</b> 61dB</li>\n<li><b>Price:</b> £1,199.99 / $1,399.99 / AU$1,899.99 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Neo 2T is Tacx’s top-of-the-range smart trainer, and it’s priced accordingly. It looks like a spaceship and its spec and performance are among the best out there.</p>\n<p>The Neo 2T uses an arrangement of magnets to create a virtual flywheel, and this offers fantastic ride feel, along with the ability to change the level of inertia depending on the virtual terrain. Tacx also claims the Neo 2T power measurement is accurate to +/- 1 per cent, which is up there with the best.</p>\n<p>At this price, it’s a little disappointing that a cassette isn’t included and, at 21.5kg with no carry handle, it’s not the easiest thing to move about. Overall, however, the Neo 2T is about as good as it gets in terms of performance.</p>\n<p>When you consider that it can be used without a power source (making it useful for pre-race warm-ups) and that it’s also one of the quietest trainers available, you have a very compelling package. The only real problem is whether or not you can afford it.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/resistance-trainer/tacx-neo-2t-smart-review/\">Read our full review of the Tacx Neo 2T</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Wahoo Kickr (2020)</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The ride feel of the Wahoo Kickr smart trainer 2020 is fantastic.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><b>Type:</b> Direct drive</li>\n<li><b>Maximum power:</b> 2,200 watts</li>\n<li><b>Maximum simulated gradient:</b> 20%</li>\n<li><b>Weight:</b> 21.5kg</li>\n<li><b>Flywheel:</b> 7.25kg</li>\n<li><b>Cassette included:</b> Yes</li>\n<li><b>Noise:</b> 61dB</li>\n<li><b>Price:</b> £999.99 / $1,199.99 / €1,199.99 / AU$1,699.99 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Kickr is Wahoo’s top-of-the-range model. It offers a fantastic ride feel, thanks to its relatively large 7.25kg flywheel, and it’s also wonderfully quiet.</p>\n<p>Setting the unit up is very easy, with Wahoo including a cassette and a generously sized power cable, so you shouldn’t need an extension lead. Once the bike’s installed, it offers a very solid platform for sprints up to 2,200 watts and gradients up to 20 per cent – these aren’t the highest maximums, but they should be plenty for the vast majority of riders.</p>\n<p>Power accuracy has increased over the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/wahoo-kickr-smart-trainer-2020-review/\">2019 Wahoo Kickr</a>, up from +/- 2 per cent for the previous model to +/- 1 per cent, and the trainer is now able to automatically calibrate itself without a traditional spin down.</p>\n<p>Wahoo also amended the trainer’s supporting feet over the previous design too, to allow for five degrees of lateral tilt and help give a more realistic ride feel.</p>\n<p>The Kickr doesn’t have any absurd headline features or specs, and it doesn’t come cheap, but it does everything you need brilliantly and without fuss.

High maximum power outputs or leg-breakingly steep gradients are nice to have, but far from essential, so don’t be swayed by on-paper spec alone. Do you really need a trainer capable of handling a 2,000-watt sprint?</p>\n<p>If you’ve got lots of money to spend, then, as usual, you’ll have far more options to choose from.</p>\n<p>In our experience, the biggest leap in performance comes around the £500 mark, where direct-drive models start to appear. The ride feel, noise levels and power accuracy all typically take a big step up at this point, and beyond that it’s all marginal gains.</p>\n<h3>Flywheel</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> In theory, heavier flywheels should create a better ride feel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A flywheel helps to create a road-like feel due to the kinetic energy they’re able to store, and the resultant inertia they give – essentially, when you stop pedalling it should feel like you’re coasting on a real road.</p>\n<p>It’s generally considered that the heavier the flywheel, the better the ride feel ought to be, but this isn’t always the case. Construction, materials and design all play a role, and some brands are in fact now using virtual flywheels with magnets.</p>\n<p>Though more expensive, virtual flywheels have the advantage of being able to change the level of inertia depending on the virtual terrain – so climbing should feel different to riding on the flat, just like in the real world.</p>\n<h3>Weight and packability</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some smart trainers, such as this Elite Suito, have legs that fold in for easier storage.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Trainers come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and weights. Wheel-on trainers are, more often than not, the lightest and most packable kind of trainer.</p>\n<p>Direct-drive trainers tend to be much bulkier. Though size and shape can vary wildly – with some models folding up to a very slim form – they tend to all be pretty heavy regardless.</p>\n<p>If you’ve got a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/tips-for-building-the-ideal-indoor-training-space/\">pain cave</a>, it may not matter at all how big and heavy your trainer is. But if you have to set it up and pack it down before and after every session, then you’ll need to take this into consideration, especially if you can’t fold down the supporting legs of a trainer or it lacks a carry handle.</p>\n<h3>Power and gradient</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Wahoo Kickr Climb replicates gradients.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Trainers have different maximum power figures that correspond to the amount of resistance they’re able to generate. They typically range from around 1,500 watts to over 3,500 watts.</p>\n<p>1,500 watts should be plenty for most people, and 2,000-watt models ought to be enough for practically everyone except professional sprinters.</p>\n<p>The gradient figures relate to the maximum incline a trainer can simulate – given in per cent, like on the road. Again, a lower figure isn’t going to hinder your training, it simply means those trainers won’t be able to simulate the virtual world perfectly whenever the gradients go beyond what the trainer is capable of.</p>\n<p>However, many indoor cycling apps, including Zwift, automatically set the difficulty level to 50 per cent, so a 10 per cent ‘real life’ gradient will feel like five per cent on a smart trainer.</p>\n<p>Unless you’re planning to change the app’s difficulty setting, this may mean you don’t need as high a spec as you think.</p>\n<h3>Noise</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wheel-on trainers are more affordable but noisier.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Allen Krughoff / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Indoor trainers used to be notoriously noisy, but there have been vast improvements made over the past few years. Wheel-on trainers are still typically louder than direct-drive trainers, but the gap has narrowed somewhat.</p>\n<p>Direct-drive smart trainers are typically the quietest, with some models being so quiet that the sound from your drivetrain becomes the main source of noise.</p>\n<p>For both types of trainer, though, the noise levels tend to increase as your power output and the flywheel speed go up.</p>\n<p>If you want to be able to do interval training sessions inside your house or flat early in the morning, perhaps before your partner/family/housemates wake up, or after work when they’re trying to watch their favourite series in the next room, a quiet trainer is a must.</p>\n<p>If you have your trainer set up in a garage, on the other hand, it’s less of an issue.</p>\n<h3>Useful accessories</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A heart rate monitor can provide even greater insight into your training.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Once you’ve got all of the essential items, there are still a few extra <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/turbo-trainer-accessories/\">turbo trainer accessories</a> that can make your indoor cycling sessions even more enjoyable.</p>\n<p>First of all, most smart trainers need to be plugged into the mains electricity supply in order to function properly. A good-quality extension lead might therefore be necessary, depending on where you’re going to set up the trainer, because the supplied plugs don’t always have super-long wires.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bluetooth-i-apologize/\">We recommend using Bluetooth</a> to connect all of your hardware together, but if you have ANT+ accessories (such as an older power meter or a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-choose-a-heart-rate-monitor/\">heart rate monitor</a>) that you also want to connect, then you’ll need an ANT+ dongle for your laptop or tablet.</p>\n<p>You might need a riser block for your front wheel. Whether you do depends on the model of trainer, but it’s worth checking – those trainers that need a riser block to level you out don’t always come with one included.</p>\n<p>Even if your trainer doesn’t technically need one to level the bike out, using a front wheel riser block can also increase stability, as it helps to stop your front wheel from moving underneath you. They’re not that expensive, either (unless you want it to be, in which case Wahoo will sell you its<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/wahoo-kickr-climb-first-ride-review/\"> Kickr Climb</a> gradient simulator).</p>\n<p>A trainer mat of some sort – preferably one that’s rubberised underneath to help it stay in place – will help catch your sweat, and will also help dampen vibrations and keep noise levels down, especially if you’re using your trainer on a wooden floor (which tends to amplify the sounds).</p>\n<p>Sweat nets that cover your top tube, steerer tube and stem might also be a good investment to protect them from perspiration and corrosion (also, read our advice on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/using-bike-on-turbo-trainer/\">using a carbon bike on the turbo trainer</a>).</p>\n<p>However, what you really want is a big, powerful fan. Something around 20 inches will do, or if you’re really flash you can get a ‘smart’ fan such as the<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/wahoo-launches-cheaper-kickr-plus-trainer-controlled-fan/\"> Wahoo Kickr Headwind</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re using a laptop or a tablet, a specific stand or table to hold it in front of you is very useful as well, or if you want to use a TV, the Apple TV box is able to use the Zwift app.</p>\n<h2>What about smart bikes?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Smart bikes are expensive, but they do everything a smart trainer does and more.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you’re really dedicated to indoor cycling, there is another tier of smart cycling device available; the smart bike.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/indoor-bikes/\">best smart bikes</a> offer all of the features a top-end smart trainer does, plus more, making them a perfect fit in the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/best-zwift-setups-for-every-rider/\">best Zwift setup</a>. Once assembled, they’ll always be ready and waiting for you to jump on and start pedalling, and they’re essentially maintenance-free too.</p>\n<p>The downsides? First of all, they’re typically very expensive. You’ll also need a dedicated space to use it in, as they’re far too big and heavy to put away for storage when not in use.</p>\n<h2>Why should you train indoors rather than just ride outside?</h2>\n<p>This is a fair question and one that really has a very personal answer.</p>\n<p>However, most of us will probably admit that we don’t enjoy getting wet, cold or dirty.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if you live in a particularly busy part of the world, training indoors can be much safer.
