Vivo took the top spot, thanks to its success in the budget segment of the market.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat's despite both companies selling fewer phones, owing to a 7 percent drop in the overall Chinese market, which is suffering the effects of a nationwide deflation. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, Huawei saw its market share grow to 16.5 percent from 9.4 percent, thanks to the popularity of its home-grown Mate 60 series. Apple recorded a 15.7 percent market share, falling from 19 percent a year ago, according to Counterpoint's data. Overall growth is likely to remain in the red during Q1 2024 on muted spending and a few new product launches, said the analysts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's ‌iPhone‌ struggled during the first few weeks of the year for several reasons, according to Counterpoint. \"Primarily, it faced stiff competition at the high end from a resurgent Huawei while getting squeezed in the middle on aggressive pricing from the likes of OPPO, vivo and Xiaomi,\" said Senior Analyst Mengmeng Zhang. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Although the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> is a great device, it has no significant upgrades from the previous version, so consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now,\" he added.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple resellers in China have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/iphone-sales-china-dependent-promotions/\">increasingly dependent on discounts</a> to shift ‌iPhone 15‌ stock in a market that has entered a general malaise. The discounts followed Apple's own <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/apple-offers-rare-iphone-discounts-china/\">rare price reductions</a> on its website ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in February. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple sales in China dropped 13 percent to $20.8 billion in the quarter ended December, falling short of the $23.5 billion predicted by analysts, and forecasts for a quick improvement in 2024 do not look particularly optimistic.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/\">Counterpoint</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/china-iphone-sales-slump-early-2024/\">iPhone Sales in China Declined 24% in First Six Weeks of 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-sales-in-china-declined-24-in-first-six-weeks-of-2024.2421087/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"da4a1e4fffa04f6ceea7e1ec86ae3be66f1598b1c3280bd6b8f05bb5b03f6aba","category":"Apple"}
