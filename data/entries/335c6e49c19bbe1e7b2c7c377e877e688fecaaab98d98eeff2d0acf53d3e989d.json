But a few things are becoming increasingly clear: The variant spreads stunningly fast, and it can largely circumvent protection from two vaccine doses. However, people who have received a third vaccine dose are well-protected against severe disease.</p>\n<p>In a White House press briefing Wednesday, top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci reviewed the early laboratory and real-world data on vaccine effectiveness. Numerous laboratory studies have all shown that levels of neutralizing antibodies from two doses of a vaccine are significantly lower against omicronâ€”potentially so low that they do not protect against the variant. But studies looking at neutralizing antibodies after a third dose consistently find a substantial increase in protection. One study found a <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.12.21267646v1\">38-fold rise in the level of neutralizing antibodies against omicron</a> after a third dose of an mRNA vaccine.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821067#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821067&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"335c6e49c19bbe1e7b2c7c377e877e688fecaaab98d98eeff2d0acf53d3e989d","category":"Tech"}
