It has dropped internal combustion engines in the process—the new Macan is entirely battery electric, built on a dedicated EV platform. We've been following the car's development for some time, but today's news fills in a lot of the gaps, and it's the first time we've seen the Macan not covered in camouflage. Porsche is launching with two specifications. There's a Macan 4 that starts at $78,800, and a Macan Turbo starting at $105,300.</p>\n<p>Last year <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/porsche-gives-ars-a-look-inside-its-next-ev-the-all-electric-macan/\">Ars took a dive into the engineering</a> that has gone into the new Macan and its underlying architecture, a new platform called PPE or Premium Platform Electric. Developed together with Audi, it uses an 800 V powertrain that's an incremental improvement upon the one you'd find in a Porsche Taycan.</p>\n<p>We <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/porsches-macan-ev-comes-out-in-2024-we-drive-the-prototype/\">also already know it's fun to drive</a>, especially the Macan Turbo. Rear-wheel steering makes it very nimble, and the two-valve dampers do a good job of making you think the car weighs less than it does. The Macan 4 isn't a slouch and can send up to 402 hp (300 kW) and 479 lb-ft (650 Nm) to its wheels, so launching up a highway on-ramp to 60 mph should take 4.9 seconds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998907#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998907&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
