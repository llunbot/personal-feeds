But the deal's state financing requires legislative approval as part of California's annual budget process and is drawing criticism from some lawmakers and a union for journalists.</p>\n<p>Governor Gavin Newsom is on board, <a href=\"https://a14.asmdc.org/press-releases/20240821-assemblymember-wicks-secures-agreement-state-major-tech-companies-support\">saying</a> that the \"agreement represents a major breakthrough in ensuring the survival of newsrooms and bolstering local journalism across California—leveraging substantial tech industry resources without imposing new taxes on Californians.\" The deal \"will provide nearly $250 million in public and private funding over the next five years, with the majority of funding going to newsrooms,\" said an announcement by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, a Democrat.</p>\n<p>A \"News Transformation Fund\" would be created with funding from the state and Google and be administered by the UC Berkeley School of Journalism. The state would contribute $30 million the first year and $10 million in each of the next four years, according to a summary provided to Ars by Wicks' office.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044874#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044874&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"24a6ea01c4da9ff2f8ba6f409082cd3c39d7beaee6031dfa01f2bb6f5bdec6fe","category":"Tech"}
