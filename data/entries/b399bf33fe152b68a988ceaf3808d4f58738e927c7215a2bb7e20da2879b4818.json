{"title":"Samsung Responds, Hand-Wavingly, to Fake Moon Photos Controversy","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23641069/samsung-fake-moon-controversy-english-language-blog-post","date":1679343188000,"content":"\n<p>Jon Porter, The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Samsung has published an <a href=\"https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/feature-stories/how-samsung-galaxy-cameras-combine-super-resolution-technologies-with-ai-technology-to-produce-high-quality-images-of-the-moon/\">English-language blog post</a>\nexplaining the techniques used by its phones to photograph the\nMoon. The post’s content isn’t exactly new — it appears to be a\nlightly edited translation of an article <a href=\"https://r1-community-samsung-com.translate.goog/t5/camcyclopedia/%EB%8B%AC-%EC%B4%AC%EC%98%81/ba-p/19202094?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-GB\">posted in Korean last\nyear</a> — and doesn’t offer much new detail on the process.\nBut, because it’s an official translation, we can more closely\nscrutinize its explanation of what Samsung’s image processing\ntechnology is doing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’ve been a couple of follow-ups on this since <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/11/samsung-moon-photos-fake\">I wrote about it</a> a few weeks ago. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1afpDuTb-P0\">Marques Brownlee posted a short video</a>, leaning into the existential question of the computation photography era: “What is a photo?” Input’s Ray Wong took umbrage at my having said he’d been “taken” by Samsung’s moon photography hype <a href=\"https://twitter.com/raywongy/status/1634713922509979653\">in this Twitter thread</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a clarifying way of thinking about it. What Samsung is doing with photographs of the moon is fine as a photo editing feature. It is not, however, a <em>camera</em> feature. With computational photography there is no clear delineation between what’s part of the camera imaging pipeline and what’s a post-capture <em>editing</em> feature. There’s a gray zone, to be sure. But this moon shot feature is not in that gray zone. It’s post-capture photo editing, even if it happens automatically — closer to Photo<em>shop</em> than to photo<em>graphy</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Where I draw the line is whether the software is clarifying reality as captured by the camera or not. Is the software improving/upscaling the input, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/halidecamera/status/1634734250309353473\">or substituting</a> the input with imagery that doesn’t originate from the camera? Here’s a snippet of a debate on Twitter, from Sebastiaan de With (at the helm of the <a href=\"https://halide.cam/\">Halide camera app</a> account):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One can argue “Well, it’s the moon, it’s always the same” — and\nperhaps that’s true, but the issue is with photographic accuracy.\nIn-fill should be informed by underlying input data and shape the\noutput image; you can argue output shouldn’t reshape the input\nthis significantly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And that’s my point. What if the moon <em>weren’t</em> the same? What if it gets hit by a large meteor, creating a massive new visible-from-earth crater? Or what if our humble friend Phony Stark blows tens of billions of dollars erecting a giant billboard on the surface of the moon, visible from earth, that reads “@elonmusk”? A photo of the moon taken with one of these Samsung phones wouldn’t show either of those things, yet would appear to capture a detailed image of the moon’s surface. A camera should capture the moon as it is now, and computational photography should help improve the detail of that image of the moon as it appears <em>now</em>. Samsung’s phones are rendering the moon as it was, at some point in the past when this ML model was trained.</p>\n\n<p>And that’s where Samsung steps over the line into fraud. Samsung, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iLwsPnywFc0\">in its advertisements</a>, is clearly billing these moon shots as an amazing feature enabled by its 10× optical / 100× digital zoom telephoto camera lens. They literally present it as optically superior to a telescope. That’s bullshit. A telescope shows you the moon as it is. Samsung’s cameras do not.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/20/samsung-moon-shots\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b399bf33fe152b68a988ceaf3808d4f58738e927c7215a2bb7e20da2879b4818","category":"Tech"}
