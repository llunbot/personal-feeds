Will Speck and Josh Gordon (<em>Blades of Glory</em>, <em>Office Christmas Party</em>) will direct and produce. Given that pedigree (zany comedies), it's clear this film won't be a serious historical drama about the struggles of those who traveled the American West.</p>\n<p>In fact, the report not only notes that it will be a comedy—it says it will be a musical, too. \"The movie will feature a couple of original musical numbers in the vein of <em>Barbie</em>,\" according to THR's sources. EGOT winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul will be responsible for the original music in the film.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/apple-is-turning-the-oregon-trail-into-a-movie/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/apple-is-turning-the-oregon-trail-into-a-movie/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"25b16013c2187353d2f7f17f4c4013f0fa0d4e3f7c21d38c155d7fdf90dc91e0","category":"Tech"}
