{"title":"Dodgers Legend Fernando Valenzuela Dies at 63, on the Cusp of the First Yankees-Dodgers World Series Since His Star Turn in 1981","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5808180/2024/10/22/fernando-valenzuela-dead-mlb-dodgers/","date":1729713482000,"content":"\n<p>Andy McCullough, reporting for The Athletic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Fernando Valenzuela, the Mexican southpaw who became an icon in\nLos Angeles during his rookie season with the Los Angeles Dodgers\nand remained a vibrant part of the franchise’s fabric for the next\nfour decades, died Tuesday, the Dodgers confirmed. He was 63. [...]</p>\n\n<p>In 2023, the Dodgers recognized Valenzuela’s indelible place\nwithin franchise lore by altering a club policy in his honor:\nValenzuela became the first Dodger to see his number retired\nwithout reaching the Hall of Fame. Before the ceremony in August\n2023, as his No. 34 took its place at Dodger Stadium in between\nSandy Koufax’s No. 32 and Roy Campanella’s No. 39, Valenzuela\npronounced himself shocked.</p>\n\n<p>“It never crossed my mind that this would ever happen,” Valenzuela\nsaid. “Like being in the World Series my rookie year, I never\nthought that would happen.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m only barely old enough to remember Fernandomania, but it was a genuine nationwide sensation. Everyone knew who “Fernando” was, even people who cared little to nothing about baseball. Every kid I knew, boys and girls alike, wanted a Fernando baseball card (or sticker — baseball stickers were the thing at the time).</p>\n\n<p>In 1978, Valenzuela — the 12th of 12 children in a poor Mexican farming family — was a 17-year-old, pitching in an obscure Mexican pro league. A Dodgers scout who’d gone to evaluate a shortstop on the opposing team instead found himself captivated by Valenzuela’s pitching. Two years later he was an end-of-season call-up in the Dodgers’ big-league bullpen.</p>\n\n<p>Then came 1981. Thanks to a fluke injury to the Dodgers’ intended starter, Valenzuela was their starting pitcher on opening day. He threw a complete game shutout. <a href=\"https://x.com/jeffpassan/status/1848935076634992766?s=12\">He started the season 8-0 with an ERA of 0.50</a>. He pitched all 9 innings in each of those 8 games. His best pitch was a screwball (a breaking ball that curves the “wrong” way) — a bygone pitch no one even throws any more. His physique was more beer league than major league. His windup was comically exaggerated — more like Bugs Bunny than a typical major league pitcher. Down 2 games to 0, he led the Dodgers to victory in game 3 of the 1981 World Series against the Dodgers’ most-despised foe, the Yankees, and the Dodgers won the next 3 games to take the championship. He won both the Rookie of the Year and Cy Young awards. He spoke very little English at the time, but had a charisma that broke any language barrier. He was 20 years old.</p>\n\n<p>I was 8 at the time, and already a very sore loser. Valenzuela was the first athlete I can remember from an opposing team whom I had mixed feelings about. You just couldn’t help but like him.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See More:</strong> “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dqgtpqscT0\">Remembering Fernandomania</a>” — a splendid 11-minute short film MLB produced a few years ago. The film does a great job emphasizing how much Valenzuela meant to the Mexican-American community in Los Angeles. His playing heyday was 40 years ago, but his influence on the Dodgers’ relationship to their then-still-kinda-new home city remains palpable today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And One More:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecdJuWcZuR0\">Watch this clip from 2017</a> and not get goosebumps.
