After a beta period, the official release occurs in the fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors of what macOS 15 will entail are scarce as usual–because software development doesn’t rely on third-party production and manufacturing like hardware does, rumors about macOS don’t happen often. But when rumors do leak, they will be tracked in this article. Here’s everything we know so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated 6/7/24</strong>: Apple may call the macOS 15 AI feature set, Apple Intelligence.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 15 release date: When will macOS 15 arrive?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2013, Apple has released macOS during the fall season in the U.S. The company has established a pattern of releasing iOS first, followed a few weeks later by macOS. Here are the release dates from the past five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>macOS 14 Sonoma: September 26, 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 13 Ventura: October 24, 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 12 Monterey: October 25, 2021</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 11 Big Sur: November 12, 2020</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS 10.15 Catalina: October 7, 2019</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will unveil macOS 15 at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC</a> during a keynote on June 10, where it will show off the biggest new features. Apple will also start the developer beta period at that time, followed by a public beta a few weeks later. Apple releases beta updates semi-weekly before the official release in the fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 15 compatibility: Which Macs will get macOS 15?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No reports have been made about the macOS 15 compatibility list. On average, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1997296/intel-mac-support-compatibility-apple-silicon.html\">Macs get 6.6 years of macOS updates</a>, with models older than that only receiving another year or two of security updates and bug fixes. Also read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673939/this-is-how-long-macs-and-macbooks-last.html\">How long do Macs last</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The compatibility list is becoming a pressing concern for users of Intel Macs. After Apple introduced its M-series Macs, the company said it will continue to support Intel Macs for several years, but it did not offer specifics. The last Mac to switch from Intel to Apple Silicon was the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347010/new-mac-pro-2023.html\">Mac Pro</a> last year. The clock is ticking on Intel Macs, but it’s likely that the last generation of Intel Macs will be on the macOS 15 compatibility list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the current compatibility list for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS Sonoma</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iMac from 2019 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Pro from 2019 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iMac Pro from 2017</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Studio from 2022 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook Air from 2018 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac mini from 2018 and later</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MacBook Pro from 2018 and later</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple launched its first M1 Macs (MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro Mac mini) in late 2020, so some Intel models will still get another year of updates with macOS 15. the most likely candidates to drop support are the 2018 models and the iMac Pro. To find out which version of macOS and older Mac can run take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673697/what-version-of-macos-can-my-mac-run.html\">macOS compatibility list</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 15 name: What will the new version be called?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since Apple stopped using jungle cats with macOS 10.9 Mavericks, it’s used California places to identify its annual OS updates. The last several years have been Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, and Catalina. We’re not sure yet what locale Apple will choose for macOS 15, but it has <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1795091/macos-14-name-skyline-rincon-ios-ipados-features.html\">trademarked several unused place names</a>, including Condor, Mammoth, Redwood, and Sequoia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS 15: Rumored new features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s possible that macOS 15 may not have a lot of new features. Last November, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2129704/ios-18-macos-15-development-paused-to-address-bugs.html\">reported</a> that Apple shifted from developing new OS features to fixing bugs and improving performance. Since that report came a few months ago, Apple may have finished that task and returned to developing new features. Regardless, the switch impacted the development time for new features and that could mean macOS 15 has fewer than originally planned.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>AI everywhere</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Several reports over the past few months have stated that Apple is doing a lot of work towards AI, and that generative AI (using AI to create content) will have a big role in macOS. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2113912/apple-generative-ai-siri-suggested-replies-ios-18.html\">reported</a> in October 2023 that AI will be prominently featured in iOS 18 with macOS following at a later date. That seems to indicate that macOS 15 won’t get as many AI features as iOS 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If macOS 15 doesn’t match iOS 18 feature for feature, it’s not known when Apple will bring those missing features over. It could decide to introduce them in updates throughout the year or wait until macOS 16 in 2025. iOS has long been Apple’s priority, so it won’t be surprising if macOS 15 doesn’t have the same new features as iOS 18. However, it’s nearly certain that macOS will have some new AI features baked in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman reported that Apple is going to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/apple-wwdc-2024-what-to-expect-ai-ipados-18-macos-15-siri-updates-more&amp;xcust=1-1-2360223-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2360223/wwdc24-ai-artificial-apple-intelligence.html\">refer to its AI feature set as “Apple Intelligence.”</a> One key characteristic of these features is that users will have to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2357953/iphone-mac-openai-chatgpt-siri-opt-in-service.html\">opt-in to use them</a>. Gurman also reports that Macs will need at least an M1 chip or later. Apple Intelligence features will mostly be processed on the device, which is different from other platforms where AI processing is done in the cloud. But Apple Intelligence will be able to determine if cloud processing is needed and will use it when appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accessibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A report by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/ios-18-macos-15-accessibility/&amp;xcust=1-1-2265062-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">MacRumors</a> states the macOS 15 will have several new Accessibility features. These include Adaptive Voice Shortcuts, which activates accessibility features by speaking a phrase; a Live Speech enhancement that lets users create categories; and expanded app support for custom font sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Freeform Scenes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/ios-18-macos-15-freeform-app-scenes/&amp;xcust=1-1-2265062-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">MacRumors</a> reports that the Freeform app will get a new feature called Freeform Scenes, which will let the user select specific sections on boards to ease navigation. Scenes will reportedly work with iCloud for sharing and editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Redesigned Calculator app</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2309958/macos-15-new-featrues-calculator-app.html\">AppleInsider</a> reports that Apple is working on a new Calculator app. It may be redesigned to resemble the iOS version, with new features including a history tape, revamped conversions, and a resizable window.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Safari 18</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2320446/safari-ai-features-rumors-ios-18-macos-15.html\">AppleInsider</a> reports that Safari 18, which will be in macOS 15, will include several new features, including AI-enhanced “Intelligent Search,” a “Web Eraser,” and a new page controls menu. An update in 2025 will provide an AI enhancement to Visual Lookup not just in Safari, but throughout the OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Calendar and Reminders sync</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/05/01/apples-ios-18-to-streamline-task-management-with-unified-events-and-reminders&amp;xcust=1-1-2265062-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AppleInsider</a> reports that the Calendar app will allow users to manage reminders from within the Calendar app, which will also have minor UI changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>System Settings UI tweaks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2343754/systems-settings-to-get-an-interface-tune-up-in-macos-15.html\">AppleInsider</a> reports that System Settings will have UI changes to make it easier for users to quickly get to frequently-accessed settings.</p>\n\nMac, MacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9e6ea751575a91ee7af67590be6234c303fe1bd31b4ec3808462f6853147f687","category":"Apple"}
