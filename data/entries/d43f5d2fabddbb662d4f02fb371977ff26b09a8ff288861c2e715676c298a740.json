FDA</em></h2>\n<p>The case began last November in a federal court in Texas when a group of anti-abortion organizations (led by the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine) <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.370067/gov.uscourts.txnd.370067.1.0_1.pdf\">filed a lawsuit against the FDA,</a> claiming that the regulator's approval and regulation of mifepristone was unlawful. As expected, District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk issued <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.370067/gov.uscourts.txnd.370067.137.0_17.pdf\">a preliminary injunction</a> on April 7 revoking the FDA's 2000 approval and ruled that the FDA's actions between 2016 and 2021, which included easing restrictions on the drug's use and access, were also unlawful. Kacsmaryk granted a seven-day stay of the order, allowing time for the government to appeal the ruling and seek a longer freeze. Without intervention, mifepristone could have been wrenched from the market nationwide on April 15.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932588#p3\">Read 45 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932588&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d43f5d2fabddbb662d4f02fb371977ff26b09a8ff288861c2e715676c298a740","category":"Tech"}
