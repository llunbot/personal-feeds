Imagine a passionate nation dishing out a nickname reflective of the flag they’re so proud to represent. The lion has been the symbol of Flanders for almost a thousand years and the flag covers the roadside at bike races in the Belgian region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Johan Museeuw <em>is</em> the Lion of Flanders. It even says so on the entrance to his house.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A stone’s throw</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Museeuw was given the nickname by Belgian reporter Michel Wuyts in the early 1990s. It’s helped by the fact his name rhymes with the Flemish word for lion, ‘<em>leeuw</em>’, but Museeuw is Flanders to the core. He was brought up in Gistel, West Flanders and has never moved out of the region, even when he signed for an Italian team as a professional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I stayed in Belgium my whole career; it’s my country,’ he says. ‘I went everywhere on training camps but my base was always Belgium and I didn’t have plans to move to another country.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-02-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Johan Museeuw ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-02-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-02-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-02-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-02-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-02-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-02-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-02-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-02.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>These days he lives just off the Oude Kwaremont climb at the aptly named Cobblehouse, which he also runs as a guesthouse for people to stay, ride and hang out with him… which is what I’m here to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Cobblehouse right in the heart of the Tour of Flanders’ headline act of the Kwaremont and Paterberg, we could knock out a short ride taking in all the big bergs and be home before lunch. Except when Museeuw was racing, the race didn’t finish in Oudenaarde, it finished 25km further east in Ninove, and the Muur van Geraardsbergen was the icon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You can’t tell my story without the Muur,’ Museeuw says, but that doesn’t mean he’s not in favour of the change.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"676\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-03-676x970.webp\" alt=\"Johan Museeuw ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-03-676x970.webp 676w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-03-209x300.webp 209w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-03-768x1102.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-03-1070x1536.webp 1070w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-03-1427x2048.webp 1427w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-03-750x1076.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-03-1140x1636.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-03.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>It’s important to choose the right wheel as the Muur reaches its toughest section.</figcaption><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘It’s the same, it’s Flanders, just bigger than it was,’ he says. ‘With the Gran Fondo on the Saturday people are coming from everywhere and so on the Sunday you see people from all over. Flanders is bigger than it was, it’s international. They changed the circuit because it was getting bigger and Ninove wasn’t able to hold a big race like that. Oudenaarde is really the centre of the Flemish Ardennes and it’s a good spot to have the finish there. After a couple of years I think everybody agreed it was a good move.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Museeuw won the Tour of Flanders three times, but perhaps even more impressive is that he finished in the top three on eight occasions altogether – it’s safe to say he knows how to race the Ronde. However, he’s not one for dishing out his secrets. When I ask about his tactics heading onto the Muur, he simply says, ‘At this point in the race you know how your legs are,’ and, ‘You have to go full gas.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the reality is he never needed to think – racing Flanders came naturally to him.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>The special relationship</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Museeuw was seen as a sprinter in the early part of his career, and after a stint as a domestique he got his first opportunities with Lotto in 1990, winning two bunch sprints at the Tour de France including on the Champs-Élysées. However, outside of team time-trials he wouldn’t win another stage in his career. That’s because in 1991 he established himself as a certified Classics contender.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-04-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Johan Museeuw ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-04-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-04-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-04-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-04-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-04-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-04-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-04-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-04.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In just his second Tour of Flanders, Museeuw got into a four-man move that rode clear, a group that included two former winners in Edwig Van Hooydonck and Rolf Sørenson. Van Hooydonck had instigated the move and attacked again on the Bosberg to go clear, eventually winning by 45 seconds, but Museeuw used his sprinting prowess to lead the others home in second place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If you come second when you’re young at the Tour of Flanders then you’re quite happy,’ he says, ‘but then you think maybe I can win this race in the future.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-05-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Johan Museeuw ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-05-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-05-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-05-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-05-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-05-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-05-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-05-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-05-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-05.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>The Muur van Geraardsbergen is <em>the</em> iconic Flanders climb.

The following year he missed out as the early breakaway held on to the line, but that mistake wouldn’t be made again the year after that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1993 Museeuw had moved to Patrick Lefevere’s GB-MG team and he came into the race not only having won Dwars door België (which later became Dwars door Vlaanderen) a couple of weeks before, but also wearing the Belgian champion’s jersey. He was one to watch.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-06-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Johan Museeuw ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-06-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-06-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-06-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-06-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-06-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-06-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-06-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-06-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-06.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>At the top of the Taaienberg sits the monument to ‘the new Lion of Flanders’ Tom Boonen, who was Museeuw’s teammate in 2003 and 2004.</figcaption><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>He once again found himself in a decisive move that included Van Hooydonck, but after attacking 28km out on Tenbossestraat, Museeuw was alone with Van Hooydonck’s Wordperfect teammate Frans Maassen. The latter sat on, making Museeuw – the better sprinter – do the work, but it wasn’t enough. Museeuw had too much on the finishing straight and won his first Tour of Flanders – and in the Belgian colours too. It’s safe to say he was addicted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If you win then you know the difference between how to be a winner and not,’ he says. ‘Then you try to win another time and another time. That’s cycling.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that came the understanding that he was then the man to beat, but in 1994 he was yet again in the decisive move with a group of four coming to the finale in Meerbeke together. With his pedigree, in that moment Museeuw was expected to defend his title, but Gianni Bugno launched early and pipped Museeuw by the tiniest of margins (it took officials ten minutes to decide the winner).</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-07-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Johan Museeuw ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-07-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-07-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-07-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-07-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-07-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-07-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-07-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-07-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-07.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Museeuw regularly recites, ‘You can’t win the race here but you can lose it’, but after 2024 he concedes Flanders can now be won from the Koppenberg.</figcaption><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘It’s easy to say things afterwards,’ Museeuw says. ‘That year I made a mistake in the sprint, but you can’t do the sprints twice. In cycling you can only do something once and when it’s not the right decision, it’s over.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Museeuw is ever the pragmatist. While he’s the first to celebrate his wins, he isn’t bitter or regretful about his losses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You have to improve every year. That’s cycling. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Sometimes you win Flanders, sometimes you win Roubaix, sometimes you become World Champion, sometimes you win a World Cup race. Every year is another year and you have to always improve yourself and try to win something.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to 1995, the year Museeuw became immortal. Now in the iconic Mapei colours, he chased back to the front of the race after puncturing just over 50km from the finish and immediately had to follow an attack from Fabio Baldato on the Tenbosse. The pair arrived in Geraardsbergen together and Museeuw attacked up the Muur.

In 1996 he was awarded the Vélo d’Or after winning Paris-Roubaix in a Mapei 1-2-3, the World Championships – on a course that should have been too hilly for him – and the overall UCI World Cup, but he only managed third in Flanders after having mechanical issues on the Muur. He then came an uncharacteristic 13th in 1997 after crashing, in what was a much quieter season on the whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s not always sure that you win, but you come to the start with a very good condition and you think I have so many chances to win today. But there’s always bad luck,’ he says. ‘Every Flanders I did I had a chance to win, but I won just three times. I was always in good shape; I was ready.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"694\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-08-694x970.webp\" alt=\"Johan Museeuw ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-08-694x970.webp 694w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-08-215x300.webp 215w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-08-768x1074.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-08-1099x1536.webp 1099w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-08-1465x2048.webp 1465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-08-360x504.webp 360w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-08-750x1048.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-08-1140x1593.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-08.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>‘No cheating,’ <em>Cyclist</em> is told as we sneak our way up the Paterberg’s gutter.</figcaption><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>His final and record-equalling third win came in 1998, and it was the Tenbosse that once more proved decisive. This time Museeuw went solo and rode alone over the Muur and the Bosberg to victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just a week later, the unthinkable happened. Museeuw’s attempt at doing the Flanders-Roubaix double turned into a true Sunday in Hell when he crashed on the Arenberg. His knee was shattered and he almost had to have his leg amputated after gangrene infected the wound. It could have been the end of his career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However in 1999 he was back, and started the season in good form, coming sixth at Omloop, second at Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne and winning Dwars door Vlaanderen. At Flanders he snuck away with Peter Van Petegem on the Muur after a crash in the group of favourites, and they were joined by Frank Vandenbroucke on the Bosberg. But this time Museeuw’s sprint wasn’t there and he came home third.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-09-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Johan Museeuw ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-09-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-09-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-09-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-09-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-09-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-09-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-09-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-09-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-09.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Local dish <em>geutelingen</em> is like a pancake and goes down very nicely on a ride.

I was still rehabbing to try to reach the same level,’ he says. ‘I knew already before the Muur that I didn’t have the chance to win because I wasn’t feeling really 100% and I knew that it would be very hard for me to win. But anyway I was on the podium and it’s OK.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this part of his career Museeuw found more success in Roubaix than Flanders, winning in France again in 2000. He last season was 2004, but arguably 2002 was his swansong. After only managing 33rd and 16th in the previous two Rondes, Museeuw was back in the thick of the action, creating the split on the Muur to produce the lead group of five going into the finale. But it was his former teammate Andrea Tafi who would take the spoils, going solo in the final few kilometres. Museeuw did win the sprint for second, but it’s not one he celebrates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I don’t look to be second and third, I look to my victories,’ he says. ‘There’s just one thing that counts – it’s to be the winner, and the second and third place is nothing. Nobody asks how many times I was second, how many times I was third.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+8\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Lion’s pride</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Museeuw is a big believer in the phrase, ‘You can’t win the race there but you can lose it.’ He says the same about every climb we ride apart from the Muur and the Bosberg. That’s despite his Tenbosse move in 1998 proving you didn’t need to wait until the final two climbs to make a decisive move, and even he admits nobody thought it was possible to win from the Koppenberg until Mathieu van der Poel did it in 2024. Still, the Muur will always be the icon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘There’s some history there, eh?’ he says. ‘When you ride up, it’s iconic. People do it for the first time and they love it – it’s special. But that hill is not in the race anymore. When I’m riding up now I don’t think about my victories.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-10-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Johan Museeuw ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-10-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-10-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-10-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-10-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-10-1366x2048.webp 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-10-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-10-1140x1709.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-10.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Joe McGorty / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>While he has fun getting the extra attention when Omloop comes around, he’s still a Tour of Flanders man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Omloop is not Flanders. It’s a big race but it’s not the same level. OK, it’s the same final but it’s not the same race,’ he says. ‘The Tour of Flanders is, from the start to the finish line, something special.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I ask, how was he so good at the Tour of Flanders? Was it because his body was attuned to bad weather? ‘That’s all bullshit.’ Was it the team? ‘We were a great team and you need each other to win races, but it’s always the rider that wins.’ Was it the pre-race strategy? ‘You can have a thousand tactical meetings before but it’s always the riders that make the race, as well as the other teams.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, he says, ‘You have to follow the other teams and follow the race, but especially you have to follow your belly. Sometimes it’s not important that you’re very strong, you have to also race with your brain, look what others do and make decisions. You can have a lot of experience but the race is always tactical, and you have to feel it in your belly.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-11-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Johan Museeuw ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-11-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-11-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-11-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-11-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-11-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-11-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-11-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-11-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/johan-museeuw-ride-11.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>On the day <em>Cyclist</em> visits, it’s Museeuw’s first ride of the year at home in Belgium after spending some time training in Calpe.

For me it was more important to win races than it was to be the Lion of Flanders.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That may be true, but being with Museeuw on his home turf, there’s no hiding his status.

Having lived near the coast all his life, Museeuw bought the land in the late 2010s and developed it into his new home, right in the heart of the Tour of Flanders action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connected to the main house is a guesthouse where he hosts visitors for a unique holiday riding with him on the cobbles, picking his brain and drinking wine (curiously for a Belgian, Museeuw doesn’t drink beer). On the outside it’s a pretty normal house, but step inside and it’s basically a museum, packed to the rafters with memorabilia including his trophies, his cobbles, his old jerseys and some of his old bikes – including a still dirty Eddy Merckx bike from Paris-Roubaix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To book your stay, visit <a href=\"https://www.cobblehouse.be/\" target=\"_blank\">cobblehouse.be</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/flanders-ride-johan-museeuw\">In the Lion’s den: Flanders ride with Johan Museeuw</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"dbf43f1119fecf31e4c456f81bdd89a3384c0168e5289b7c39da68b5c14656a7","category":"Cycling"}
