After a shorter wait of just three years, the Olympic Games are back. It’s time to brush off your armchair knowledge of taekwondo and diving and embrace new sports such as climbing and breakdancing, which will make its Olympic debut this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paris is hosting the Games, so for the road riders fresh from the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a>, this will be an easy transition. The cycling events will span the entire length of the games including road racing, mountain biking, BMX and track cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 33rd Olympic Games will kick off on Friday 26th July with an opening ceremony on the River Seine in the French capital. There’s no time to waste as the time-trial events will take place the following day on the 27th July 2024. The track racing will round out the cycling at Paris 2024 on Sunday 11th August.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Paris 2024 Olympics: Key information</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332446251-970x650.jpg\" alt=\"olympic games cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332446251-970x650.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332446251-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332446251-768x515.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332446251-1536x1030.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332446251-2048x1373.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332446251-750x503.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332446251-1140x764.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Date:</strong> 27th July-11th August (cycling events)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Location:</strong> Paris (road cycling), Vélodrome National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (track cycling and BMX), Élancourt (mountain biking), Place de la Concorde (BMX)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Number of cycling events</strong>: 22</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Live UK TV coverage: </strong>BBC, Discovery+</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-2024-gallery\">The 21 best photos from the Tour de France 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/prize-money-2024-tour-de-france\">Who won the most prize money at the 2024 Tour de France?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-over-the-counter-medication-1\">Does cycling have a problem with over-the-counter medication?

In total, 512 athletes will compete across all cycling disciplines during the 2024 Games with 66 medals up for grabs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the last Olympic Games in Tokyo, Great Britain topped the medal table with six golds. The Netherlands came in second with five golds and Switzerland finished in third with one gold medal (and six medals across the board).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Road cycling: Men’s and women’s road race and time-trial </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1234145737-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Ecuador's Richard Carapaz celebrates after crossing the finish line to win the men's cycling road race during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at the Fuji International Speedway in Oyama, Japan, on July 24, 2021.

The road races are often hard to predict, but it will give us a chance to see the riders in their national colours instead of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-sponsors\" target=\"_blank\">their trade kits.</a> There are four gold medals on offer for road racers at Paris 2024. The road schedule kicks off with the time-trials during the opening weekend of the Games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Tokyo 2020, Richard Carapaz of Ecuador took the gold medal in the men’s road race and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> secured a surprise gold medal in the men’s time-trial. No surprise was bigger than Anna Kiesenhofer’s win in the women’s road race though. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/annemiek-van-vleuten\" target=\"_blank\">Annemiek van Vleuten</a> thought she’d won the road race, but she had to settle for silver and a win in the women’s time-trial instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/LHmEuBUyxiutYNxFVSW4hY-1200-80.jpg-970x601.webp\" alt=\"paris 2024 time trial profile\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/LHmEuBUyxiutYNxFVSW4hY-1200-80.jpg-970x601.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/LHmEuBUyxiutYNxFVSW4hY-1200-80.jpg-300x186.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/LHmEuBUyxiutYNxFVSW4hY-1200-80.jpg-768x476.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/LHmEuBUyxiutYNxFVSW4hY-1200-80.jpg-750x464.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/LHmEuBUyxiutYNxFVSW4hY-1200-80.jpg-1140x706.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/LHmEuBUyxiutYNxFVSW4hY-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Paris 2024</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The men and women will tackle the same 32.4km route. Along the way, the race will move eastwards, passing through the Bois de Valenciennes. This park used to host the Tour’s arrival back in the days of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/from-the-archive-in-conversation-with-eddy-merckx\" target=\"_blank\">Eddy Merckx</a> in the 1960s and 70s. From here, the race moves into the city centre again., The course will pass through Place de la Bastille towards the finishing line outside Les Invalides, an old military hospital that now hosts the Musée de l’Armée. The profile is pan-flat and should favour the purists.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/dLVZjkQ77rAmah8BYsbDhS-970x600.jpg\" alt=\"mens road race paris 2024 profile\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/dLVZjkQ77rAmah8BYsbDhS-970x600.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/dLVZjkQ77rAmah8BYsbDhS-300x186.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/dLVZjkQ77rAmah8BYsbDhS-768x475.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/dLVZjkQ77rAmah8BYsbDhS-1536x951.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/dLVZjkQ77rAmah8BYsbDhS-750x464.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/dLVZjkQ77rAmah8BYsbDhS-1140x706.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/dLVZjkQ77rAmah8BYsbDhS.jpg 1813w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Paris 2024</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The road racing will take place on the streets of central Paris. The focal point of both men’s and women’s road races will be the cobbled climb to Montmartre (1km at 6.5%), the much-photographed neighbourhood formerly of French impressionists. The men will take this climb on three occasions over the 273km-long route. The men’s race clocks up a total elevation gain of 2,800m, similar to the Tour of Flanders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The favourites for the men’s race will include the Netherlands’ Mathieu van der Poel, who will be looking to improve his relationship with the Olympics after crashing out of Tokyo 2020. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a> and Mads Pedersen have specifically targeted the Olympics, but their preparation has been altered due to injury and a lack of form.

The women will also negotiate the climb to Montmartre three times. In total, the women’s race takes in 1,700m of altitude gain, similar to their Tour of Flanders. Both races will end just across the river from the iconic Eiffel Tower at Trocadéro. For Tour de France purists, this will be a wildly different arrival to the Tour’s Champs-Elysées finale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the blue ribbon women’s event, Lotte Kopecky will start as the favourite. GC riders <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/elisa-longo-borghini-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Elisa Longo Borghini</a> and Demi Vollering will be co-favourites. Looking beyond these galacticos, Grace Brown and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cecilie-uttrup-ludwig-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig</a> have a solid chance of winning a medal in the road race. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dates of road cycling events</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Women’s time-trial:</strong> Saturday 27th July</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Men’s time-trial:</strong> Saturday 27th July</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Men’s road race:</strong> Saturday 3rd August</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Women’s road race: </strong>Sunday 4th August</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Track cycling: Men’s and women’s team pursuit, sprint, madison, keirin and omnium</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"641\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332814421-970x641.jpg\" alt=\"jason kenny tokyo 2020 olympics\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332814421-970x641.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332814421-300x198.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332814421-768x508.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332814421-1536x1016.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332814421-2048x1354.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332814421-750x496.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1332814421-1140x754.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Track cycling will take place from Monday 5th August to Sunday 11th August. The programme spans 12 events and will take place at the Vélodrome National in the Parisian suburb of Yvelines. This track was opened in 2015 and has previously hosted the 2022 UCI Track World Championships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The events on offer span a smaller amount of races than a typical track programme. Sprint, keirin and the omnium (the cycling equivalent to the decathlon) will be available for individual riders. For teams, the team sprint, pursuit and madison events will offer a chance for collective glory. Track racing often entails a knockout process that includes quarter-finals and semi-finals, so it’s important to follow the track events over the course of the week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Madison will continue its Olympic comeback in 2024 after a successful reintroduction at Tokyo 2020. The main event will be the sprint and keirin events. These races will see some of the highest speeds on the boards at this year’s Olympics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a close battle at the last Olympics, the men’s team pursuit will be closely watched. Denmark and Italy will reopen their rivalry in this four-kilometre-long team effort against the clock.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dates of track cycling events*</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Women’s team sprint:</strong> Monday 5th August</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Men’s team sprint:</strong> Tuesday 6th August</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Women’s team pursuit:</strong> Wednesday 7th August</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><strong>Men’s team pursuit</strong>: </strong>Wednesday 7th August</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Men’s omnium:</strong> Thursday 8th August</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Women’s keirin: </strong>Thursday 8th August</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Men’s sprint:</strong> Friday 9th August</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Women’s madison:</strong> Friday 9th August</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Men’s madison: </strong>Saturday 10th August</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Men’s keirin:</strong> Sunday 11th August</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Women’s sprint:</strong> Sunday 11th August</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Women’s omnium: </strong>Sunday 11th August</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>*Dates listed are for the gold medal races (some events span multiple days)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mountain biking: men’s and women’s cross-country</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"626\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330707163-970x626.jpg\" alt=\" Cycling - Mountain Bike - Olympics: Day 3\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330707163-970x626.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330707163-300x194.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330707163-768x496.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330707163-1536x992.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330707163-2048x1323.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330707163-750x484.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330707163-1140x736.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption> Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Olympics offer a stripped-back mountain biking schedule. After being added to the Olympics in 1996, mountain biking at the 2024 Games only comprises one race: the cross-country. There will be no downhill events at Paris 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this race, the competitors will ride circuits around Élancourt south of Paris. The details of the course are unknown, but the race should take around 90 minutes to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reigning champion of the men’s race is <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tom-pidcock\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Pidcock</a> of Great Britain. He will be there to retain his title, however, the Yorkshireman suffered a Covid contraction during the Tour de France earlier this month. The gold medalist for the women from Tokyo 2020 was Jolanda Neff of Switzerland. She is also scheduled to compete at Paris 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dates of mountain biking events</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Women’s cross-country:</strong> Sunday 28th July</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Men’s cross-country:</strong> Monday 29th July</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>BMX: men’s and women’s freestyle and race</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"687\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1331703607-970x687.jpg\" alt=\"olympics bmx events paris 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1331703607-970x687.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1331703607-300x213.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1331703607-768x544.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1331703607-1536x1088.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1331703607-2048x1451.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1331703607-120x86.jpg 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1331703607-750x531.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1331703607-1140x808.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1331703607-190x136.jpg 190w\" /><figcaption>Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BMX is the newest cycling discipline to enter the Olympics. It has only been a part of the Olympic cycle since Beijing 2008. In Paris, the BMX events will take place outside the Vélodrome National in Yvelines and at a freestyle arena on the Place de la Concorde.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The BMX events at Paris 2024 cover two different race types. The first of these, the freestyle, is all about showing off. Riders will roll around a skate park-style stage in an attempt to wow the judges with their jumps and tricks. The event made its Olympic debut at the 2020 Olympics and will be one of the more extreme Olympic events at the 2024 Games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the week, the BMX schedule will focus on the race event. The premise for this is simple. Riders will race head-to-head around a short track filled with steep corners and bumps. It’s a high-adrenaline event filled with tricks and spills. There’s a demanding technical nature to this event which will only last around one minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last time, Great Britain swept the golds in the women’s events courtesy of Beth Shriever and Charlotte Worthington. For the men, Dutchman Niek Kimmann won the men’s race and Australia’s Logan Martin won gold in the freestyle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dates of track cycling events*</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Men’s freestyle: </strong>Wednesday 31st July</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Women’s freestyle:</strong> Wednesday 31st July</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Men’s race:</strong> Friday 2nd August</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Women’s race:</strong> Friday 2nd August</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>* Dates listed are for the gold medal races (some events span multiple days)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where to watch the cycling at Paris 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"633\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-970x633.jpg\" alt=\"anna kiesenhofer tokyo 2020 gold medal\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-970x633.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-300x196.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-768x501.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-1536x1002.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-2048x1336.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-750x489.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1330515456-1140x743.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Olympics will be available on free-to-air television across the world. In the UK, this is provided by the BBC. RTÉ will be showing the cycling at Paris 2024 over in Ireland.
