Officials will take more time to consider their options for how to proceed with the mission after discovering the small helium leak on the spacecraft's service module.</p>\n<p>The space agency did not describe what options are on the table, but sources said they range from flying the spacecraft \"as is\" with a thorough understanding of the leak and confidence it won't become more significant in flight, to removing the capsule from its Atlas V rocket and taking it back to a hangar for repairs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026155#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026155&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f4560cc71ee2ca982a70a7b3721f729401f38c2f9d7160388630b0f034f1b123","category":"Tech"}
