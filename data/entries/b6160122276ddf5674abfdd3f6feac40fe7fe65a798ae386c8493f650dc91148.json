Compared to a modern MacBook, the battery is inferior. I got\n6 hours in mixed use yesterday. The screen is only barely\nadequate to run at retina-like 2× for smooth looking fonts. Linux\nis far less polished than macOS. But somehow it just doesn’t\nreally matter.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, 6 hours is enough for regular use. If I’m doing more\nthan that in a single stint without getting up, I’ll be paying for\nit physically anyway. And the somewhat cramped resolution has made\nme fall in love with full-screen apps again, like I used to do\nwith that 11” MacBook Air.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the Mac-vs.-Wintel rivalry was <em>the</em> tech rivalry. Other rivalries came and went, like Netscape-vs.IE, Word-vs.-WordPerfect, Quark-vs.-Pagemaker, C-vs.-Pascal, but the main event was always Mac-vs.-Wintel. When the smartphone revolution occurred that rivalry was eclipsed by iPhone-vs.-Android. But it’s still there.</p>\n\n<p>I’m fascinated following DHH’s switching saga. And my personal devotion to and reliance upon MacOS is such that, if the best-available MacOS-running laptop I could find got me only 6 hours of battery life, I’d accept it. I certainly remember getting <em>less</em> than 6 hours of battery life with a PowerBook. I specifically remember when it was dicey whether you could get through a coast-to-coast flight using a fully-charged Mac laptop. I lived. But nowadays, I wouldn’t fret boarding a coast-to-coast flight with my MacBook Pro only half-charged.</p>\n\n<p>Apple silicon has spoiled me. I don’t even turn the display brightness down when running my MacBook Pro on battery power. I literally just don’t worry about it. It’s like two competing alternative universes when it comes to performance-per-watt. Presumably that’s what Microsoft seeks to change with Windows-on-ARM and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/09/microsoft-surface-event-arm-chips\">these imminent new Surface laptops based on new chips from Qualcomm</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/28/dhh-framework-13\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b6160122276ddf5674abfdd3f6feac40fe7fe65a798ae386c8493f650dc91148","category":"Tech"}
