That’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-introduces-universal-derailleur-hanger-concept-and-its-brilliant/\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Derailleur Hanger</a>, and to SRAM’s credit at this point, it <em>is</em> nearly universal. That’s great news if you happen to break a derailleur hanger since spare should be easier to come by. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC06750-2.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC06750-2-1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth UDH\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC06750-2-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC06750-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC06750-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC06750-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC06750-2-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC06750-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC06750-2-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC04070-2.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC04070-2-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth UDH\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC04070-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC04070-2-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC04070-2-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC04070-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC04070-2-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC04070-2-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WT25_UDH_DSC04070-2-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While SRAM offers their own UDH replacement hanger, more and more companies are starting to offer their own replacements – like Wolf Tooth Components. By fully CNC machining the hanger from 6061-T6 aluminum, WTC claims their hanger has a stiffer construction with more crisp shifting. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a
