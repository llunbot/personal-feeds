The company said the alignment pin and a shear pin fitting assembly performed as designed during the mated portion of the flight, and only the alignment pin detached after the spaceship was released from the mothership.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001425#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001425&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"94da8b05e0b592fefc81f3846ee185ad16f7368d6b62f5022bbb333ac97a4d3c","category":"Tech"}
