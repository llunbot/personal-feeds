The option is probably intended to help multiple users identify which lens inserts belong to them, rather than be a novel way to personalize the device, since they are very small and there is no other engraving option for the Vision Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple offers two versions of the ZEISS Optical Inserts at different price points. \"ZEISS Optical Inserts — Readers\" are available for $99, while \"ZEISS Optical Inserts — Prescription\" are available for $149. The inserts attach to the Vision Pro lenses magnetically, allowing for precise viewing and eye tracking. Purchase requires a valid prescription from an optician.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPre-orders of the Vision Pro started earlier today and the device goes on sale in the United States on Friday, February 2.\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/free-engraving-available-with-vision-pro-inserts/\">Free Engraving Available With Apple Vision Pro ZEISS Lens Inserts</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/free-engraving-available-with-apple-vision-pro-zeiss-lens-inserts.2416786/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a367890faac7d22336ee1cedfe30ef65a16a15f7a7ebfbc06970b32c2b3c6f07","category":"Apple"}
