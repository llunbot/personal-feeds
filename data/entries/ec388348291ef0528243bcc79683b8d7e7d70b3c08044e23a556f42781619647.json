Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>LAS VEGAS—Audi's sleek four-door electric sedan, the e-tron GT, has just received its midlife refresh. Usually, a midlife refresh is mostly cosmetic, intended to prevent the model from feeling too stale in the marketplace. But this time Audi has kept the visual changes to a minimum. There are new wheels and a new interior, as well as redesigned front and rear fascias, although the changes are quite subtle. Instead, there's been a comprehensive reengineering effort under the skin.</p>\n<p>Perhaps not quite as comprehensive as the Polestar 2 refresh—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/now-rear-wheel-drive-the-single-motor-polestar-2-is-better-than-ever/\">which swapped front-wheel drive for rear</a>—but there are now new motors and a new battery pack, which bring with them increased range, a reduced 0–60 mph time, and even faster fast-charging. Audi says it has also worked on the driving dynamics, including adding the same active suspension system we recently experienced in the Porsche Panamera.</p>\n<p>As before, the e-tron GT comes in two specifications, but now the base model is the $125,500 S e-tron GT. This now offers 670 hp (500 kW), a 148 hp (110 kW) improvement on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/the-2022-audi-rs-e-tron-gt-shows-badge-engineering-is-nothing-to-fear/\">last year's model</a>. That drops the 0–60 mph time from 4 seconds down to 3.3, but the 51-mile ( 82 km) increase to its range—now 300 miles (482 km) on a single charge—is probably going to be the most enticing improvement for potential buyers. That's courtesy of a new 105 kWh (gross, 97 kWh usable) battery.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/2025-audi-rs-e-tron-gt-more-range-more-power-still-drives-like-an-audi/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/2025-audi-rs-e-tron-gt-more-range-more-power-still-drives-like-an-audi/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
