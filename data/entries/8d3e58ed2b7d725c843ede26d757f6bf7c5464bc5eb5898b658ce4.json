This means the so-called \"iPhone 17 Pro\" could be the first model with Face ID hidden under the display, but he still expects there to be a hole in the display for the front camera on the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYoung's revised timeframe contradicts a report from Korean publication <em>The Elec</em> claiming that under-display Face ID <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/iphone-16-pro-to-feature-under-display-face-id/\">would launch on the iPhone 16 Pro next year</a>. Young is typically accurate, so the technology is more likely to be at least two years away.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the meantime, it has been widely rumored that Apple will expand the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/18/dynamic-island-all-iphone-15-models-rumor/\">Dynamic Island to all four iPhone 15 models</a>, after introducing the feature on the iPhone 14 Pro models last year. If and when iPhones with under-display Face ID finally arrive, it is possible that the Dynamic Island will remain an optional software feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYoung previously claimed that the iPhone could adopt an all-screen design with both Face ID and the front camera moved under the display <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/10/all-iphone-15-models-pill-and-hole-rumor/\">in 2026 at the earliest</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/face-id/\">Face ID</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/under-display-face-id-2025-ross-young/\">Under-Display Face ID on iPhone Still at Least Two Years Away, Says Analyst</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/under-display-face-id-on-iphone-still-at-least-two-years-away-says-analyst.2383233/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8d3e58ed2b7d725c843ede26d757f6bf7c5464bc5eb5898b658ce4","category":"Apple"}
