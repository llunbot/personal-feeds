The European Commission on Wednesday <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_1794\">announced</a> a <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/document/afb20917-5a6c-4d87-9d89-666b2b775aa1_en\">proposal</a> it has adopted that would implement long-term repair requirements on electronics makers if the European Parliament and Council approve it.</p>\n<p>The regulation would apply to any devices with repairability requirements in the EU, including vacuum cleaners, washer-dryers, welding equipment, servers, and data-storage devices. The EU is currently hammering out <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/eu-regulators-want-5-years-of-smartphone-parts-much-better-batteries/\">right-to-repair requirements for smartphones</a> and tablets.</p>\n<p>Already, the EU requires vendors to repair or replace products within two years of purchase for free if the product is defective. The new regulation would require companies to provide a free repair (instead of replacing the product) if doing so would be the same price or cheaper than replacing it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926309#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926309&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1de66c8fcb5cb63e61cde87cbdde9bf16343c022570e2a585c8ca7a9fa934055","category":"Tech"}
