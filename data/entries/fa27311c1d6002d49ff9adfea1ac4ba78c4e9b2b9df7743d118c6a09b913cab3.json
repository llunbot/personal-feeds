The sixth-generation ‌iPad mini‌ was initially introduced in September 2021, so it almost three years old at this point.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has been working on a seventh-generation version of the ‌iPad mini‌, and rumors have suggested that it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/ipad-mini-7-not-expected-before-late-2024/\">could come out this year</a>. The next ‌iPad mini‌ is expected to include an A17 Pro or better chip to support Apple Intelligence, along with updated front and rear cameras. Updates that Apple has been making across its product lineup could also be included, such as Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple today announced plans to hold a fall iPhone-centric event on September 9 to introduce the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models, new Apple Watch models, and new AirPods. It is not clear if Apple will also refresh the ‌iPad mini‌ at that time, but Apple could hold a new version for a second fall event or announcement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe are still counting on several M4 Macs this year, so there will likely be some kind of second announcement. Apple is rumored to be planning to refresh the MacBook Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> with M4 chips, so an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> with a similar A-series chip would fit in with those announcements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple updated the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models with M4 chips earlier this year, and introduced a two versions of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/ipad-mini-stock-dwindling/\">iPad Mini Stock Dwindling at Apple Stores, Refresh Could Be Coming</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-stock-dwindling-at-apple-stores-refresh-could-be-coming.2434457/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fa27311c1d6002d49ff9adfea1ac4ba78c4e9b2b9df7743d118c6a09b913cab3","category":"Apple"}
