{"title":"Readers’ Rides: Simon’s Jones Diamond Frame","link":"https://theradavist.com/2021/11/readers-rides-simons-jones-diamond-frame/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=readers-rides-simons-jones-diamond-frame","date":1636122466000,"content":"<p>This week’s Readers’ Rides comes from Berlin, where Simon shares his Jones Diamond Frame with us. Read on below for Simon’s perspective of his all-terrain build…<span></span></p>\n<p>Here I’ve got my Jones diamond frame for your Readers Bikes section, which is like most of my other bikes more or less inspired by what happens on your site over the years.</p>\n<p>I’m a bit into production-made bicycles if they are kind of special, outstanding, made for niche or were ahead of their time. So a Jones fits perfectly in these criteria but were not easy to find in terms of availability and a good price here in Germany. But luckily I found one!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/oikjibhhdpilmpmo.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I bought the frame a few years ago from someone who is also active in the best german singlespeed forum ever, the Eingangradforum aka die Anstallt. The only lack was the huge chainsuck the frame once had, which not only scratches the paint but also made some deeper marks into the steel of the stays. But after a short chat with Flo from Fern Bicycles, if it needs to be repaired, we decided to leave it like this and just have look at it from time to time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/mpbpjjjgaehfioec.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Then I build it up mostly with parts I had, so I just needed to build the wheelset and get myself an H-bar. Nothing super special, except maybe the tire choice. First, I run the Kenda Saber 29×2.6 which was super lightweight and fast for the size but were not really grippy when it comes loose caused by the maximum reduction of the tread pattern. Then Goetz from Dailybreadcycles here in Berlin, a really good friend of mine and distributer for Rene Herse stuff offered me to test ride the new (back then) Rene Herse Fleecer Ridge Tires, which fit even better to what this bike I think is best for. Going for a fast but comfortable bikepacking trip with the ability to go offroad and even ride some more or less technical trails.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/11/hggildpphkkceain.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Parts to mention a few are the Thomson seatpost, Easton Haven 100mm stem, ODI Longneck grips, Chris King Headset, WTB Koda (150mm wdth) saddle, ZTR Flow rims with DT 350 and Jones hubs, XT shifting, and some old SLX brakes, which I run on several full suspended mtbs before without too much caring over the last few years and are still running perfectly.</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
