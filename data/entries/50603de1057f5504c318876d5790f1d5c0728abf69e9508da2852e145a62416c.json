{"title":"Beta 6 of MacOS 15 Sequoia Now Prompts Monthly, Instead of Weekly, for Screen Recording Permissions","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/14/macos-sequoia-screen-recording-prompt-monthly/","date":1723931047000,"content":"\n<p>Chance Miller, writing for 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/12/beta-6-for-developers-now-available-visionos-2-ipados-18-macos-sequoia-and-more/\">macOS Sequoia beta 6</a>, however, Apple has adjusted this\npolicy and will now prompt users on a monthly basis instead. macOS\nSequoia will also no longer prompt you to approve screen recording\npermissions every time you reboot your Mac.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s initial plan to require authorization weekly prompted a\nlot of blowback from Mac users, including <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/08/apples-permissions-features-are-out-of-balance/\">Jason Snell at Six\nColors</a> and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/08/the_mac_is_a_power_tool\">John Gruber at Daring Fireball</a>. Apple\nseemingly heard all of this feedback and determined that a\none-month approval window is a fair compromise. [...]</p>\n\n<p>A permission request on a monthly basis is certainly better than\none on a weekly basis, but I still think there needs to be a way\nto permanently grant an app screen recording permissions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Agreed. Perhaps the seemingly under-documented <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_persistent-content-capture\">Persistent Content Capture entitlement</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@chockenberry/112922175155649837\">pointed out by Craig Hockenberry</a> (who works on the excellent longstanding Iconfactory utility <a href=\"https://xscopeapp.com/\">xScope</a>, the entire point of which requires screen content capture) could be a part of such an exemption?</p>\n\n<p>I do think, after some off-the-record conversations this week, that both the MacOS and security teams at Apple are trying to get the balance right on these permission issues. I continue to think part of the problem is thinking too small, and requiring what’s effectively whack-a-mole with multiple recurring permission prompts. Playing that game of whack-a-mole monthly instead of weekly is absolutely an improvement. But I still think there ought to be a way to grant a properly notarized app permanent permission.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/17/macos-15-beta-6-monthly-screen-recording-prompts\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"50603de1057f5504c318876d5790f1d5c0728abf69e9508da2852e145a62416c","category":"Tech"}
