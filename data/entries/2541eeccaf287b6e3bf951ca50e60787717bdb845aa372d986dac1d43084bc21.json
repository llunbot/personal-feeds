To commemorate the event and welcome Messi to the league, Inter Miami is hosting an event it calls “Bienvenido Messi” on Sunday, July 16 at 8:30 p.m. ET. Previously, the event had been called “The Unveil” by Inter Miami.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://theathletic.com/4680320/2023/07/10/messi-inter-miami-introduction-gold-cup/&amp;xcust=1-1-1989383-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">The Athletic</a>, users who have signed up for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1382408/mls-season-pass-subscription-apple-tv-plus.html\">MLS Season Pass on Apple TV+</a> will be able to watch the event in its entirety. However, before the start time, the event is being promoted on the main Watch Now section of the Apple TV+ site, which gives the impression that non-holders of MLS Season Pass will be able to watch the event. Apple has not confirmed if an MLS Season Pass is required to watch “Bienvenido Messi.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Messi is scheduled to play his first match for Inter Miami on July 21, which definitely requires an MLS Season Pass to watch on Apple TV+. New subscribers can sign up for the MLS Season Pass for $12.99 per month or $39 for the remainder of the regular season, which runs through October 21. The regular price for a whole, complete season is $12.99 per month or $79 per season with an Apple TV+ subscription or $14.99 per month or $99 per season without a subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MLS regular season will pause following games on Saturday, July 15 for Leagues Cup play and resume on Aug. 20.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/messi-Apple-TV.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Messi Apple TV\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/messi-Apple-TV.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3272w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/messi-Apple-TV.jpg?resize=300%2C178&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/messi-Apple-TV.jpg?resize=768%2C455&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/messi-Apple-TV.jpg?resize=1200%2C711&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/messi-Apple-TV.jpg?resize=1536%2C911&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/messi-Apple-TV.jpg?resize=2048%2C1214&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"711\" /><figcaption><p>“Bienvenido Messi” airs on Sunday, July 16, at 8:30 p.m. Eastern.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Athletic also reports that MLS is in negotiations to have parts of the event broadcast live on Fox and Univision television during the halftime of the CONCACAF Gold Cup final between Panama and Mexico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before Saturday’s announcement, the Inter Miami’s event did not specifically refer to Messi, it was widely presumed that Messi is the person the event is named after. The club did state that The Unveil will feature “exciting entertainment, speeches on the pitch, and more.” Messi signed with the club in June after spending two years with Paris Saint-Germain in France. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Messi is considered one of the greatest soccer players of all time, having won a record seven Ballon d’Or awards, given to the top player in the world. He has won several club championships and led Argentina to a World Cup title in 2022.</p>\n\nApple TV, Streaming Media</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2541eeccaf287b6e3bf951ca50e60787717bdb845aa372d986dac1d43084bc21","category":"Apple"}
