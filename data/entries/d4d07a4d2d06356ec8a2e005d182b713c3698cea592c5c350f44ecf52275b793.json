The Tech Organizer opens up folio style, and both halves are rife with straps and pockets for holding various accessories.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/woolnut-tech-organizer-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are two main stretch mesh straps that can hold a power adapter big enough for the 16-inch MacBook Pro along with smaller accessories like ‌AirPods‌ and flash drives. A small loop at the bottom is able to hold an ‌Apple Pencil‌ or a regular writing implement, and there's a little zip pouch that can be used for smaller items. Inside the zip pouch, there's a slot for an AirTag or an SD card.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/woolnut-tech-organizer-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nA strap in the middle is able to wrangle cords, and then the other side houses two pockets that are big enough to hold large cables, mice, and other similar-sized products. The inside is all lined with a recycled taffeta polyester material, and the whole thing zips up with a smooth, high-quality YKK zipper to keep everything enclosed and protected.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/woolnut-close-ups.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Leather Tech Organizer is the ideal size to tuck into a backpack or a bag, and it can also be carried on its own. It measures in at 8.5 inches long, 5.3 inches wide, and 2 inches tall, and it weighs 8.8 ounces.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/woolnut-tech-organizer-4.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have five of <a href=\"https://www.woolnut.com/shop/accessories/tech/tech-organizer-cognac/\">the Leather Tech Organizers</a> from Woolnut to give away to <em>MacRumors</em> readers.
