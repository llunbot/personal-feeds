These last around ten minutes and are <em>very</em>\npodcast, with an astonishingly convincing audio back-and-forth\nconversation.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s an example podcast created by feeding in an earlier version\nof this article (prior to creating this example).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I listened to the whole 15-minute podcast this morning. It was, indeed, surprisingly effective. It remains somewhere in the uncanny valley, but not at all in a creepy way. Just more in a “this is a bit vapid and phony” way. I think that if you played this example podcast for a non-technical person who isn’t informed at all about the current state of generative AI, that they would assume for the first few minutes, without question, that this was a recorded podcast between two actual humans, and that they might actually learn a few things about generative AI. But given that the “conversation” is literally about creating artificial podcasts like this very example, I wonder how many would, by the end, suspect that they were in fact listening to an AI-generated podcast? It’s quite meta — which the male voice on the podcast even says during the episode.</p>\n\n<p>But ultimately the conversation has all the flavor of a bowl of unseasoned white rice. Give it a listen, though. It’s remarkable.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/30/notebooklm-generated-podcasts\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"035b55615e49e57565a1067d228a9bee11ebb44d3856347bf2f4a8d003f90ad8","category":"Tech"}
