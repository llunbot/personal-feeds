They don’t have Apple’s newest design or features in the 3rd-gen model, but they’ve got everything you want in a pair of buds: fantastic battery life, seamless setup, hands-free Siri, on-device controls, and super-low latency thanks to Apple’s H1 chip. And of course, you’re getting the iconic AirPods design and crisp, clear audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232610/airpods-2nd-generation-review.html\">4.5-star review</a> of the 2nd-gen AirPods, we called them “the best true wireless earbuds around” and praised the long battery life and features. And that was when the price was $159. At this deal, they’re a downright steal.</p>\n\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e1e4fd736466b4bcb5105bb18a375a0daad090a8eefb8965ae64a7646b546fbd","category":"Apple"}
