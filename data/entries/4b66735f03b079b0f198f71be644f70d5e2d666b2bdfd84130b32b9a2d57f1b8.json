From there, you can merge all of your duplicate images together.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt launch, the duplicate detection option did not work with ‌iCloud‌ Shared Photo Library, but that's changing with the iOS 16.4 update. According to Apple, after installing iOS 16.4, you will be able to detect duplicate photos and videos in ‌iCloud‌ Shared Photo Library, merging them to cut down on unnecessary extra images.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 16.4 is set to be released to the public as soon as next week. The update also includes VoiceOver support for maps in the Weather app, a fix for an issue that could cause Ask to Buy requests to fail to appear on a parent's device, a bug with Matter-compatible thermostats, and additional Crash Detection optimizations for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> models.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-photo-library/\">iCloud Photo Library</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/ios-16-4-icloud-shared-photo-library-duplicates/\">iOS 16.4 Expands Duplicate Image Detection to iCloud Shared Photo Library</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-16-4-expands-duplicate-image-detection-to-icloud-shared-photo-library.2384355/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4b66735f03b079b0f198f71be644f70d5e2d666b2bdfd84130b32b9a2d57f1b8","category":"Apple"}
