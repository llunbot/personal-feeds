{"title":"OpenAI Releases New o1 Reasoning Model","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242439/openai-o1-model-reasoning-strawberry-chatgpt","date":1726191780000,"content":"\n<p>Kylie Robison, reporting for The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>OpenAI is releasing a new model called o1, the first in a planned\nseries of “reasoning” models that have been trained to answer more\ncomplex questions, faster than a human can. It’s being released\nalongside o1-mini, a smaller, cheaper version. And yes, if you’re\nsteeped in AI rumors: this is, in fact, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-details-on-openais-strawberry-apples-siri-makeover-larry-ellison-doubles-down-on-data-centers?rc=mshudk\">the extremely hyped\nStrawberry</a> model.</p>\n\n<p>For OpenAI, o1 represents a step toward its broader goal of\nhuman-like artificial intelligence. More practically, it does a\nbetter job at writing code and solving multistep problems than\nprevious models. But it’s also more expensive and slower to use\nthan GPT-4o. OpenAI is calling this release of o1 a “preview” to\nemphasize how nascent it is. [...]</p>\n\n<p>“The model is definitely better at solving the AP math test than I\nam, and I was a math minor in college,” OpenAI’s chief research\nofficer, Bob McGrew, tells me. He says OpenAI also tested o1\nagainst a qualifying exam for the International Mathematics\nOlympiad, and while GPT-4o only correctly solved only 13 percent\nof problems, o1 scored 83 percent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Putting aside the politics and other legitimate social and legal concerns around AI, scoring that well in a difficult math exam is just incredible. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Robison wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I wasn’t able to demo o1 myself, but McGrew and Tworek showed\nit to me over a video call this week. They asked it to solve\nthis puzzle:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“A princess is as old as the prince will be when the princess is\ntwice as old as the prince was when the princess’s age was half\nthe sum of their present age. What is the age of prince and\nprincess? Provide all solutions to that question.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The model buffered for 30 seconds and then delivered a\ncorrect answer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I found this puzzle pretty damn tricky, personally. I pasted it, verbatim, into ChatGPT-4o and it solved it, correctly, the first time. I pasted it into the new o1-Preview model, and it both took longer <em>and</em> gave me the incorrect answer. I replied to o1-Preview, “Are you sure about that answer? Can you try it again?” and this time it gave me the correct answer. Still impressive, but kind of weird that this was OpenAI’s own example puzzle intended to show off the new o1-Preview model.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/12/openai-o1\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ecb3e6672917d81b40d47981a0042db6a5e63339500009d3f80f5cc600688ec8","category":"Tech"}
