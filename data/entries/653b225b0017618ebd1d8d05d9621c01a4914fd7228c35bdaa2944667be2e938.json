While the presence at the broadcasting show hasn’t been officially announced, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://applescoop.org/story/apple-to-attend-nab-show-this-year-after-10-year-absence&amp;xcust=1-1-351934-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed?\">AppleScoop spotted Apple’s inclusion on the attendee list</a>, which also includes Epic Games, Facebook and Spotify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last time Apple appeared at the National Association of Broadcasters Show was in 2011 when it <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/211739/final_cut_pro_x_blog.html\">debuted Final Cut Pro X</a> as a brand-new 64-bit application with a completely new interface.

Apple launched the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349597/apple-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-2021-m1-retina-xdr-review.html?fbclid=IwAR2Obzx_cQ7e6bOnyuscHdrysFFQnp0WgrA0AYTycDsdTcCFCUexPACUkEQ\">M1 iPad Pro with a 12.9-inch XDR display</a> this spring but Apple’s pro video app still isn’t available for the tablet.
