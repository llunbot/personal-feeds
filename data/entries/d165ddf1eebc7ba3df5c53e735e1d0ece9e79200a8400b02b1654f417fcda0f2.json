Unlike carbon and aluminum, steel doesn’t rely on expensive molds or high-volume production. Steel invites creativity, allowing nuance, craftsmanship, and personality to show through. When I came up with the idea for this article, I worried there wouldn’t be enough stories to tell. I was wrong: every factory had an authentic story to tell and a unique strength.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Manufacturing in 60 Seconds</h3>\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered how bikes go from idea to production, here’s a quick breakdown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open Model — The factory designs the product, and any brand can put its logo on it. There is no exclusivity.</li>\n<li>Original Design Manufacturer (ODM) — A collaboration between the factory and the brand. The brand provides a rough design, and the factory helps bring it to market. There is a spectrum of how much engineering each side does. Generally, the designs are exclusive.</li>\n<li>Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) — The brand provides all the drawings, specifications, and tooling, and the factory is responsible for production or, in many cases, a sub-assembly. This is how most large brands operate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The lines between these categories can blur, but that’s the general framework.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-7.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-7.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-7.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-7.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-8.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-8.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-8.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-8.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-9.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-9.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>For example, most of Innova Tire’s business is OEM for large tire brands. The tires on display are not actually for sale; they are open models: off-the-shelf designs where you pick the compound, casing, and graphics. If you want something different, like a 32” XC tire, you can even hand them a napkin sketch, and they’ll bring it to life.</p>\n<p><em>“The reason why we make open business mold is because we believe everyone got their good ideas, and we welcome everyone to make good tires together, under their brand.” — </em>Tony “The Tire Guy” Hsieh, Innova GM</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-10.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Open models and ODM may seem like shortcuts, but they often allow small brands to get started.

While other factories chase volume, Tonjin leans into creativity, specializing in fillet brazing and complex design challenges.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-12.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-12.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-13.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-13.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The open-model steel cargo e-bike on display exemplifies their work. By itself, it is already a complex design, but on closer inspection, you see the unique bends and joints that fluidly integrate the electromechanical components and set Tonjin apart.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-14.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>In particular, the joint at the headtube and rack mount — fillet brazed and filed smooth — is done simply for its beauty. As a framebuilder, a one-off cargo bike with this much design detail is already impressive, but to be able to mass-produce it is on another level.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-15.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-15.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Over the last few years, particularly after the pandemic, Tonjin has diversified, taking on more OEM aluminum frame projects and medical devices. Still, their passion for steel bikes hasn’t faded:</p>\n<p><em>“In the future, we think the general steel bike [market will] not grow very big, but the niche steel market will always remain. The famous brands will always do limited handmade steel frame productions, which will inspire more people to ride and produce steel bikes. One of our brands we work with has a chromoly cargo bike, and it makes me happy to know that they ride this bike every day, get married, take their kids to new experiences, to do happy things on a bike.” — </em>Johnny Chi (founder’s son)</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-16.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-16.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>ORA: High Technology</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://ora-engineering.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ORA Engineering</a> is the most high-tech steel manufacturer at the show. Their booth is a reflection of their work: professional, flawless, and modern. Despite the contemporary appearance, ORA is almost 30 years old, founded by Jim Hsu. Over the decades, they have steadily expanded their capabilities and in-house knowledge.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-17.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-17.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-18.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-18.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>ORA is best known for their titanium frames, but they bring the same meticulous approach to steel. What sets them apart is their in-house butting. They import unique raw materials, like 630 stainless steel from the USA, and develop their own tubing using secret forming recipes. This gives them control over quality and opens the door to creative tube profiles, like their eccentric and asymmetric butting.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-19.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>By revenue, titanium leads. But by volume, steel is still their most popular material. Their business is roughly evenly split across titanium, steel, and aluminum. Like many factories in this article, their business model has evolved: twenty years ago, OEM dominated their work. Today, 70% of their production is ODM, working closely with smaller brands.</p>\n<p><em>“We like working with small brands because they are more creative and have more interesting designs. More challenging for ORA. We feel steel has soul, and we see it in our customers who work with us. It makes us happy to see their success.” — </em>Emily Yu</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-20.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>As you can tell, ORA has a polished, professional presence.

I was searching for an open model with simple, clean lines that would complement the skinny round tubes of steel and titanium bikes.</p>\n<p>How hard could it be?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span><span></span></span><span></span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cockpit suppliers like Zoom, Kalloy, and TranzX make millions of stems per year, yet they only brought their latest e-bike and internally routed stems to the show. Every stem on display was Cybertruck-chic: big, bold, and boxy. They didn’t understand why I was there. To be fair, neither did I.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-22.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-22.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-22.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Tucked away in the corner of the trade show, I stumbled across a small Taiwanese component company: Chuhn-E Industries Co., Ltd. Hidden beneath cute, albeit outdated, aardvark decals was exactly what I was searching for — a high quality, simple, round-body stem with beautiful fillet-brazed-esque transitions to the clamps.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-23.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-23.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-24.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-24.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-24.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>According to Ken, who turned out to be the founder’s son, this stem was developed 10 years ago as a lightweight, simple, high-performance open model — exactly what I traveled all the way to Taipei to find.</p>\n<p>I also learned that Chuhn-E was a small, family-owned and operated business. Like the steel factories I visited, Chuhn-E reminded me that catalogs and websites don’t tell the full story. Culture, history, and craft don’t always come through in a product photo. You have to be there in person to see and feel it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-25.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Lung Yang: The Artisan</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lung-yang.com/eng/about/main.php\" target=\"_blank\">Lung Yang</a> might be the smallest steel factory at the show, but they still manage to produce over ten thousand frames each year.

A true mixture of modern design and traditional craftsmanship. According to Lung Yang, the prototype took over two weeks to build by hand, but with production tooling, they estimate it will only take eight hours. This is a great example of ODM at play: Stevie designs the frame, Lung Yang figures out the tooling and manufacturing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-29.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-29.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-29.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-29.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-30.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-30.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-30.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-30.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-31.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-31.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-31.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-31.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The steel business has remained stable, thanks to long-term partnerships.

In the fast-paced world of consumer goods, you must evolve to survive. They began as a welding subcontractor during the ’80s BMX boom. In the ’80s and ’90s, they produced up to 30,000 frames per month. Now, they produce around 30,000 per year.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-33.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-33.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-34.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-34.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-34.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-34.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>When people think of high-end steel road bikes, they often think of Italy.

Today, 60% is ODM for smaller brands. Although smaller brands can be more work, Maxway enjoys working with them more because they find the people behind the brands more interesting and passionate.</p>\n<p><em>“We think the future of steel is its environmental impact. Every year, this becomes a more important topic. Steel is durable, repairable, and recyclable. But for us, as a factory, steel produces very little waste. All the cutoffs and chips are recycled, and cutting oil is filtered and reused. When we remodeled part of our factory, we even repurposed the steel beams to build racks to store our frames.” – </em>Allen Chiuu, R&amp;D</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-36.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-36.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-36.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Taipei_Cycle_Show-36.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Maxway was founded by YiYi and Meg, a brother and sister team.
