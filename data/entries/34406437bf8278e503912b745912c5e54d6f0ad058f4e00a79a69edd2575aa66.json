Kennedy Jr. became the country's top health official</a>, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already pulled back some of its efforts to protect Americans with safe, lifesaving vaccines. The agency has indefinitely postponed a public meeting of its vaccine advisory committee and killed a campaign promoting seasonal flu shots.</p>\n<p>Last weekend, a Washington Post columnist <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/crampell.bsky.social/post/3licr3yinlc2o\">noted on Bluesky</a> that <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20241217184035/https:/www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html#content-sources\">the CDC's effective \"Wild to Mild\" seasonal flu shot campaign</a> had vanished. The campaign highlighted how the seasonal vaccines can prevent influenza infections from becoming severe or life-threatening. It used animals as an analogy for the diminished threat of the flu virus after vaccination, juxtaposing a lion and a domestic kitten in one ad while showing an elephant and a mouse in another. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html\">The CDC page</a> no longer leads to a \"not found\" landing page, but it wasn't restored either. It now redirects to a 2023 article announcing the campaign, which does not contain the shareable resources found on the original page. The removal is startling given that the US is currently battling one of the worst flu seasons in 15 years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated\">NPR first reported</a> that CDC staff were told in a meeting Wednesday, February 19, the campaign was halted. In a story Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/\">Stat News added more context</a> to the decision. According to the outlet's sources, the Department of Health and Human Servicesâ€™ assistant secretary for public affairs informed the CDC that Kennedy wanted vaccine advertisements to emphasize \"informed consent\" instead.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/rfk-jr-promptly-cancels-vaccine-advisory-meeting-pulls-flu-shot-campaign/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/rfk-jr-promptly-cancels-vaccine-advisory-meeting-pulls-flu-shot-campaign/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"34406437bf8278e503912b745912c5e54d6f0ad058f4e00a79a69edd2575aa66","category":"Tech"}
