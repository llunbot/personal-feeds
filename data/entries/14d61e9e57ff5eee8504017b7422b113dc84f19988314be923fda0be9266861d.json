Hunt certainly thinks so, thanks to a redesigned H_Core-reinforced carbon rim with higher strength-to-weight ratio, more carbon in the rear rim than the front, and a solid wheel build to top it off.

But they still wanted them to be both relatively lightweight and affordable. So, based on the idea that rear wheels tend to take more abuse than the front, Hunt settled on front- &amp; rear-specific carbon rim layups, beads, and wheel builds. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Enduro-H-Core-strongest-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-James-Stokoe_hop.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Enduro-H-Core-strongest-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-James-Stokoe_hop.webp\" alt=\"Hunt Proven Carbon Enduro H-Core strongest mountain bike wheels, rocky trail riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Enduro-H-Core-strongest-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-James-Stokoe_hop.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Enduro-H-Core-strongest-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-James-Stokoe_hop-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Enduro-H-Core-strongest-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-James-Stokoe_hop-1536x853.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Enduro-H-Core-strongest-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-James-Stokoe_hop-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hunt-Proven-Carbon-Enduro-H-Core-strongest-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-James-Stokoe_hop-768x427.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos by James Stokoe/Hunt)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They set their goal to build the strongest rear wheel for aggressive enduro bikes (150-190mm of travel), even at the expense of a few extra grams, knowing they could save a bit of weight on the front while still delivering plenty of strength.
