Spark 2 packs 39 amp sims into $300 Bluetooth speaker","link":"https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/03/spark-2-adds-ai-doubles-its-dsp-power-to-help-your-guitar-rock-out/","date":1741602646000,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.positivegrid.com/products/spark-2?variant=50842628030624\">Spark 2 from Positive Grid</a> looks like a miniature old-school amp, but it is, essentially, a computer with some knobs and a speaker. It has Bluetooth, USB-C, and an associated smartphone app. It needs firmware updates, which can brick the device—ask me how I found this out—and it runs code on DSP chips. New guitar tones can be downloaded into the device, where they run as software rather than as analog electrical circuits in an amp or foot pedal.</p>\n<p>In other words, the Spark 2 is the latest example of the \"software-ization\" of music.</p>\n<p>Forget the old image of a studio filled with a million-dollar, 48-track mixing board from SSL or API and bursting with analog amps, vintage mics, and ginormous plate reverbs. Studios today are far more likely to be digital, where people record \"in the box\" (i.e., they track and mix on a computer running software like Pro Tools or Logic Pro) using digital models of classic (and expensive) amplifiers, coded by companies like NeuralDSP and IK Multimedia. These modeled amp sounds are then run through convolution software that relies on digital impulse responses captured from different speakers and speaker cabinets. They are modified with effects like chorus and distortion, which are all modeled, too. The results can be world-class, and they're increasingly showing up on records.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/03/spark-2-adds-ai-doubles-its-dsp-power-to-help-your-guitar-rock-out/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/03/spark-2-adds-ai-doubles-its-dsp-power-to-help-your-guitar-rock-out/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ab252745e980ec9999aff96ecbb8e7f370866fb411d9f7db5a6c50ba08fe3a0a","category":"Tech"}
