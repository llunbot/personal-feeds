If it made a difference to the electromagnetic waves the device emitted, the regulator said it would bring the model into compliance with European standards applied in France, and the marketing withdrawal order would be lifted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this week, France <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/france-orders-end-to-iphone-12-sales-radiation/\">ordered</a> Apple to halt ‌iPhone 12‌ sales and \"fix\" existing devices over fears the devices emit too much electromagnetic radiation. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ANFR ordered Apple to \"remove the ‌‌iPhone 12‌‌ from the French market from September 12 due to the model exceeding the limit\" for electromagnetic absorption by the body. The agency also told Apple to recall every ‌‌iPhone 12‌‌ it has ever sold in the country.
