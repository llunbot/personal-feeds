The result will essentially add a second fully functional internal drive to the console.</p>\n<p>This is a big step up over the \"cold-storage\" solution <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/playstation-5-game-storage-will-apparently-continue-to-be-a-nightmare/\">that was added to the system</a> in April, which allowed last-gen games to run straight from a standard platter-based external hard drive or SSD via USB—and notably kept players from doing the same for PS5 games. As a result, the feature did little more than let players free up space for PS5 games by storing PS4 games on an external drive... or just letting PS5 downloads collect dust in storage, which Sony said still allowed for faster transfers back to internal storage than redownloading them from scratch. For PS5 players, this did little to alleviate problems with the console's internal 667GB of available space.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795141#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1795141&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Steve Haske","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"54602d124ec256de85bf83f3936a06bae2bf924032842bdd22ebfaf028d90c9e","category":"Tech"}
