Even so, there were still organisms that held on and adapted to survive an otherwise lethal lack of oxygen. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/08/429-million-year-old-trilobite-already-had-modern-like-compound-eyes/\">Trilobites</a> managed to make it through two devastating mass extinctions and still escape any surviving predators.</p>\n<p>As paleobiologists Jorge Esteve of the University of Madrid and Nigel Hughes of UC Riverside found, one trilobite species, <i>Auracopleura koninckii,</i> was especially successful when oxygen in the ocean reached dangerously low levels. This creature persevered because of an unusual adaptation. Like most trilobites, <i>A. koninckii</i> curled its segmented body into a tight ball to avoid being eaten. But it also kept growing more segments with additional legs that doubled as gills.</p>\n<p>Even though the additional segments could not roll up completely, more legs meant more breathing opportunities, which gave this species an advantage when oxygen levels were low.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961817#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961817&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7c54c1e46b6f27f6d56767bbba7480332c25b5a2f388fceaaad29d6e22f89eb3","category":"Tech"}
