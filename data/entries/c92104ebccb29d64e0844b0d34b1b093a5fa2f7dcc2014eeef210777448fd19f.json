Which is why, if you value your sanity, a Hushed Private Phone Line makes a lot of sense.

Or, if you’re dating, then you can give your Hushed number out to any potential partners. That way, if things go sideways, then it’s far easier to change your Hushed number as opposed to your regular one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burner phones <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.popsci.com/burner-phone-number/&amp;xcust=1-1-1654734-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">aren’t just for criminals</a> and spies.
