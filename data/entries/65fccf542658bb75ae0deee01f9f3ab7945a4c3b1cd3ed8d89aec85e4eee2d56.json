He\nfound by testing Figma’s tool that it would repeatedly reproduce\nApple’s Weather app when used as a design aid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Field is right to pull the feature but <a href=\"https://x.com/zoink/status/1808045655082033483\">this explanation</a> is sophistry. The feature is clearly fundamentally flawed. It’s not in need of a tweak. It’s need of being completely scrapped.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/02/figma-disables-make-design\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"65fccf542658bb75ae0deee01f9f3ab7945a4c3b1cd3ed8d89aec85e4eee2d56","category":"Tech"}
