{"title":"HashiTalks 2024: 24-hours of virtual knowledge sharing","link":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashitalks-2024-24-hours-of-virtual-knowledge-sharing","date":1699635600000,"content":"<p>Our 24-hour virtual knowledge sharing event, <a href=\"http://hashi.co/hashitalks-2024\">HashiTalks</a>, returns on Thursday, February 15, 2024, and the <a href=\"sessionize.com/hashitalks-2024\">call for proposals</a> is now open. Join us as experts from the community share how they use HashiCorp tools to codify their infrastructure, secure their data, and deploy their applications both on-premises and to the cloud.</p>\n\n<h2>What is HashiTalks?</h2>\n\n<p>HashiTalks is an annual <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/pro/hugs\">HashiCorp User Group</a> virtual event that follows the sun around the world. It is produced and facilitated by the HashiCorp Community team. We hosted our first HashiTalks in February 2019 as a 24-hour event and since then we have watched community engagement in the event grow across the globe. Attending HashiTalks is an excellent way to engage with our community, learning from international speakers presenting in their local time zones. Viewers have the opportunity to engage live in chat and interact with key community leaders who participate as emcees throughout the event.</p>\n\n<p>The 24-hour HashiTalks event will be held in English with the support of American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters. We also hold several regional events throughout the year in local languages. In 2023 we produced HashiTalks in 10 geographic regions and 8 languages. In addition to our annual 24-hour event and the regional events, we also produced three themed events specifically for builders within our ecosystem, security engineers, and application developers.</p>\n\n<p>For 2024 we’re looking to expand the accessibility of HashiCorp video content by adding new regions and languages, as well as bringing back a previous regional edition. We also plan to freshen up our themed events. We look forward to sharing more details with the community as we finalize our plans.</p>\n\n<h2>Submit to the call for proposals</h2>\n\n<p>The HashiTalks <a href=\"sessionize.com/hashitalks-2024\">call for proposals</a> (CFP) is open to the community. We are looking for 30-minute talks highlighting unique use cases, technical presentations, culture talks, and demos featuring HashiCorp community edition, cloud, and enterprise tooling. HashiTalks is an excellent platform for first-time speakers, as we offer extensive support and coaching. Bring your story about how you use one or more of our tools and we will help you share it.
