If so, you may be interested to know that Google has launched its annual <a href=\"https://santatracker.google.com/\">Santa tracking feature</a>, allowing Santa to be tracked in real time on his journey to the North Pole as he prepares to deliver presents to children around the world.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/santa-tracker-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2096\" height=\"1066\" />\r<br />\nGoogle's Santa Tracker continues a two-decade tradition for the company, allowing excited children (and grown-ups!) to keep up with the jolly gift-giver's travels throughout December 24. On this day, Santa's Village transforms into a tracking experience where children can follow Santa and his reindeer as they merrily go about their important work.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSanta can be tracked using a web browser on iPhone, iPad, or Mac by visiting Google's <a href=\"https://santatracker.google.com/\">official Santa Tracking website</a>. The site features a live map of Santa's current location, his next stop, a live video feed of his journey, and the estimated time that he will arrive in each specific location.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Santa site provides pictures of locations that Santa has already visited, a live count of gifts that have been delivered, and Santa's current distance from your location. There are also a selection of games to play, creative things to do, and videos to watch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther Santa tracking services are also available, such as the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/norad-tracks-santa-claus/id1181633163\">NORAD Tracks Santa Claus app</a> and website, but Google's site is often the most interactive and detailed.
