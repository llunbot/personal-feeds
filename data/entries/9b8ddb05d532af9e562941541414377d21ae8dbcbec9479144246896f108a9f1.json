Our favorite is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX24BN3L\">the 15-inch model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $1,299</a>, but all sizes and configurations of both the 15-inch Air and the 13-inch model have the same discount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means you can get a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHY19N3/\">brand-new M3 MacBook Air with 16GB of storage for as low as $899</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0DLHCWH55/\">the M2 model for a staggering $799</a>. This is the best price we’ve seen for this laptop outside of Black Friday when some models were $250 off. That, however, is not a price we’re expecting to see anytime soon for this MacBook Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This M3 MacBook Air laptop is Apple’s latest model, featuring a powerful chip alongside a hefty 16GB of memory. While the MacBook Pro has a legacy of being the go-to model for professionals, this particular combination should be enough to get any task done, including video editing. We recommend springing for one of the models with a 512GB SSD on board, which is plenty of storage space for whatever it is you need to hold on your computer, from pictures to apps to some light games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing this laptop is famous for, however, is that it’s thin and light, meaning you can carry it anywhere you go without minding it one bit. That day-long battery will also keep you going on your adventures. So go ahead and get your very own <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHY19N3/\">MacBook Air M3 for as low as $899 at Amazon</a> while you still can.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save $200 on the M3 MacBook Air</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX24BN3L\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9b8ddb05d532af9e562941541414377d21ae8dbcbec9479144246896f108a9f1","category":"Apple"}
