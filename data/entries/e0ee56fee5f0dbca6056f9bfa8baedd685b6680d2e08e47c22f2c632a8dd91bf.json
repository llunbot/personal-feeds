Gobik is the Spanish clothing brand that you’ll have seen being sported by Tadej Pogačar and his UAE Team Emirates squad as the Slovenian dominated the 2021 Tour de France, and more recently you’ll have seen the kit on Ineos Grenadiers, Movistar Team and FDJ-Suez riders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how did Gobik come out of nowhere to winning the Tour de France? Well, for starters it didn’t entirely come out of nowhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Gobik</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Gobik was actually started in a garage in Yecla, a town in Murcia in the southeast of Spain, by José Ramón Ortín and Alberto García in 2010. The pair were childhood friends, working at the time in motorbike helmets and architecture respectively, and would ride together in their spare time. One day they decided to make some customised kit for themselves, and they spent the next few years experimenting and refining their ideas. Eventually other cyclists around the town started asking if José Ramón and Alberto could make something for them too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hype had started to build and the whole thing was quickly getting a bit much to be a hobby, so three years since that first creation they quit their jobs to focus fully on Gobik. It’s safe to say it paid off. A little over ten years later Gobik has grown dramatically; it has become a world leader in custom cycling kit production, has dressed champions in road, gravel and mountain biking, launched its own designs, scaled up massively while keeping manufacturing in-house where possible, and it’s by no means settled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s like HP or Apple,’ jokes Gobik’s marketing and sales director Albert Medrano. ‘José Ramón and Alberto are obsessed about quality, even when it was a hobby they were always looking to keep improving the products, choosing better fabrics, changing how to transfer colours, et cetera. They were always non-conformist, they just tried to improve and improve. That’s taken them to now, with around 200 people working at Gobik in Yecla, with 200 more working for the company elsewhere.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-4-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-4.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption>Gobik</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the business started in custom designs, these days it’s a balance, Medrano says it’s a 50/50 split between custom and the collection, and both get specialist treatment at Gobik HQ. ‘When Gobik was a hobby, José Ramón and Alberto were outsourcing production, but when they launched the brand they started producing everything in house and putting all their money back into new machinery, bigger facilities and things like that. It wasn’t planned to build new facilities after a certain timeframe, it happened very organically, but now we’re planning for the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Our latest new facility was finished last year, and we decided to keep the offices in the old building to leave space in the new building to grow the factory even more – we have space to double production, which we’ll need if the demand keeps growing as it has been.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-1-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/gobik-1.jpg 1000w\" /><figcaption>Gobik</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Innovation is a big focus of Gobik’s project, with part of its space already reserved for new machinery being purchasing in order to broaden the possibilities of the designs it can create, and part of the space for a sewing team purely focussed on prototypes and, importantly, pro teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Joining with UAE Team Emirates in 2021 was a huge milestone for the brand. Not only did it bring international exposure but it helped us learn a lot,’ Medrano explains. ‘The technicality of our products jumped exponentially because the demand from the team was way bigger than the demand we’d had before then. And now working with Movistar Team and Ineos Grenadiers, the teams and the riders are asking for a really high level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The teams are lucky to have us as a sponsor though, because since we control everything in terms of production, we can easily do tests and have a back and forth. When we were with UAE we needed to develop the technology a lot, but right now the regular products of our collection are meeting the standards already. But then there are lots of conversations with team directors and riders, so we can have one product for the first race of the season and change and adapt the features throughout the season to keep up with the needs of the riders. We have one person whose job it is to keep in regular contact with the teams to be able to know what they need and keep up with the pace of how that changes.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gobik has already won on the biggest of stages and is everywhere in its native Spain, so the next target it the world. The next part of the company’s growth is international. The phase kicked off with the completion of its new facility and recently continued with a new brand identity under the slogan: ‘What a Ride’, which not only signifies the joy of cycling and the call of the commentators during a race, but also journeys in life. And for Gobik as a business, it’s been a hell of a ride so far, and this is just the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• <a href=\"https://gobik.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to discover more about Gobik and view its full range of cycling clothing</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/gobik\">Gobik or go home: How the Spanish clothing brand went from garage project to global powerhouse</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e0ee56fee5f0dbca6056f9bfa8baedd685b6680d2e08e47c22f2c632a8dd91bf","category":"Cycling"}
