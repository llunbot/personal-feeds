The RambleSwing Pro is 2″ wider than the original RambleSwing, to help accommodate bigger vehicles like full-size trucks and vans. It will still work great for mid-size trucks, SUVs, and crossovers, though. It’s compatible with some new accessories as well, like the <a href=\"https://www.rigdsupply.com/collections/rambleswing/products/hitchingpost%E2%84%A2-includes-accessory-wings\" target=\"_blank\">HitchingPost</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rigdsupply.com/collections/rambleswing/products/license-plate-light-kit-for-rambleswing-pro\" target=\"_blank\">Licence Plate Light Kit</a>. And it rocks the same high-quality build and materials as the original RambleSwing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-first-pic-e1745541742972.webp\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-first-pic-e1745541742972.webp\" alt=\"RiG'd Supply RambleSwing Pro first pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-first-pic-e1745541742972.webp 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-first-pic-e1745541742972-297x110.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-first-pic-e1745541742972-120x44.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-first-pic-e1745541742972-768x284.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / RiG’d Supply)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>OG RambleSwing Review</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the original RambleSwing, next month will mark one year since my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rigd-supply-rambleswing-jeep-swing-away-hitch-adapter-for-bike-rack/\" target=\"_blank\">first look</a> at the OG RambleSwing. Since the review, I’ve put thousands of miles on it and have been using it almost non-stop for most of the last year. It’s been mounted to my Jeep almost permanently. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What makes the RambleSwing so good? </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><br />Well, for starters, I find the whole unit kind of compact when compared to other brands. It seems a bit more “tucked” and out of the way. It also looks more “finished”, if that makes sense. It’s all USA-made and is a more polished-looking product with more “purpose” built into it than others in its class. It doesn’t look thrown together. The zinc-rich primed and semi-gloss powder-coated finish looks untouched after a year of heavy us</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the installation is a bit more involved, and you need a specifically long extension for your socket wrench, the wedge system is well thought out. Plus, once tightened down, RiG’d Supply’s wedge system makes the swing unmovable, even while off-roading in our Jeep. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The simple tethered safety pin means there’s no chance of losing or misplacing it. The integrated step comes in handy on our Jeep as a convenient way to access our rooftop tent to open and close it. The Delrin pads that the bar slides into when closing are amazing. They don’t show any signs of wearing out after countless times of opening and closing the swing. Even with two heavier bikes on the rack, closing the swing is never an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By far, the best feature on the RambleSwing is the RiG’d Supply patented 500 lb compression latch. It’s super secure, and gives you a satisfying, positive feel when latching the swing closed. The bicycle grip makes it comfortable to use. It’s a latching system that outshines others by a long shot. You’ll notice that RIG’d has relocated the latch on the new Pro version–that’s an effort to make it more accessible and easier to use for most vehicles. But on vehicles with a rear-mounted spare tire like the Wrangler, the previous latch and safety pin locations are better, which is one of the reasons why they’re keeping it as an option. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>In Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, the RambleSwing is the best rack swing-out I’ve used so far. The RambleSwing has become a beloved addition to my bike quiver and my adventure gear in general. I have no problem recommending it to anyone in the market for a bike rack swing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-OG-and-boot.webp\"><img width=\"1279\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-OG-and-boot.webp\" alt=\"RiG'd Supply RambleSwing Pro OG and boot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-OG-and-boot.webp 1279w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-OG-and-boot-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-OG-and-boot-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-OG-and-boot-768x769.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>A year later, and no signs of giving up…not even a little. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The RambleSwing Pro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pro also includes the ability to carry some new accessories as well. like the HitchingPost with an Accessory Wing, and a Licence Plate Light Kit for the HitchingPost.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-with-table-e1745541824815.webp\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-with-table-e1745541824815.webp\" alt=\"RiG'd Supply RambleSwing Pro with table\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-with-table-e1745541824815.webp 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-with-table-e1745541824815-297x182.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-with-table-e1745541824815-120x73.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-with-table-e1745541824815-768x469.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the OG RambleSwing, the Pro is also built to take a beating. It is rated for extreme off-roading, so it will keep your bike and gear stable and secure. It can also hold 50 lbs more than the OG RambleSwing, for a total of 350 lbs of load-carrying bliss.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-profile-e1745541787849.webp\"><img width=\"1156\" height=\"610\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-profile-e1745541787849.webp\" alt=\"RiG'd Supply RambleSwing Pro profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-profile-e1745541787849.webp 1156w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-profile-e1745541787849-297x157.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-profile-e1745541787849-120x63.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-profile-e1745541787849-768x405.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t worry, the original RambleSwing will still be offered. The location of the safety pin, combined with its width, makes the OG RambleSwing the perfect size for the Broncos and Wranglers, and FJs out there. However, the new HitchingPost and Licence Plate Kit are not compatible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RambleSwing Pro still uses a tether for the safety pin, but it now has a Fidlock attachment. This allows the pin to easily be removed and used in the open position. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll notice the latch has moved as well. The original RambleSwing’s latch was placed to avoid interfering with the spare tire on Wranglers, Broncos, and FJs. The Pro’s latch was moved to beef up its location and make it more ideal for the swing’s new application for bigger vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-table-top-view-e1745541968854.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"734\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-table-top-view-e1745541968854.webp\" alt=\"RiG'd Supply RambleSwing Pro table top view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-table-top-view-e1745541968854.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-table-top-view-e1745541968854-297x170.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-table-top-view-e1745541968854-120x69.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-table-top-view-e1745541968854-768x440.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Same Cool Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The RambleSwing Pro will also have the same awesome features as the original RambleSwing: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>FlipFlop Technology:</strong> Swing it open to the left or the right by simply installing in the direction that you prefer. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>In-Line-Design: </strong>The swing arm is tightly sandwiched between two Delrin glide plates, ensuring smooth opening and closing, even with 350 lbs loaded up. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wobble-Free System: </strong>The same wedge system that’s used on RiG’d Supply’s UltraSwing is used on the RambleSwing Pro. This eliminated all hitch movement. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The Ultimate Latch:</strong> This is one of the features that sets the RambleSwing apart from the rest. It’s a patented 500 lb compression latch with a comfy bike grip handle. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Integrated Step with Battleship Grip: </strong>This integrated step is great for getting in and out of your truck or SUV. It’s a great little seat too. The step is coated with Jessup grip tape, the same stuff they use on battleships. It can withstand just about everything you can throw at it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hitching Post Accessory</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-hitching-post-e1745541878145.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"940\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-hitching-post-e1745541878145.webp\" alt=\"RiG'd Supply RambleSwing Pro hitching post\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-hitching-post-e1745541878145.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-hitching-post-e1745541878145-297x218.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-hitching-post-e1745541878145-120x88.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RiGd-Supply-RambleSwing-Pro-hitching-post-e1745541878145-768x564.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The HitchingPost accessory wings are a great way to carry your bike plus extra fuel, water, camp tables, and more.
