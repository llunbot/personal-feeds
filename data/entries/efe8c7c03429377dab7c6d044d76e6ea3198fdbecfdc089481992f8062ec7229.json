A few purpose-built chips later, like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/hopper-time-nvidias-most-powerful-ai-chip-yet-ships-in-october/\">H100 Tensor Core GPU</a> (with a price of $25,000-$40,000!) and A100, and Nvidia's stock is up 50 percent this year. At press time, Nvidia's market cap is now $1.8 trillion, beating Amazon ($1.76 trillion) and Google's parent company, Alphabet ($1.77 trillion), to become the world's fourth most valuable company.</p>\n<p>How much further can Nvidia's blazing stock rally go? Next up on the '<a href=\"https://companiesmarketcap.com/\">highest market cap</a>' list is Saudi Aramco, the national oil company of Saudi Arabia, at $2.0 trillion; then Apple, at $2.8 trillion; and another company riding the AI wave, Microsoft, at $3 trillion.</p>\n<p>Nvidia's next earnings report is February 21.

Revenue was up 206 percent from the same quarter last year, and of the company's $18.12 billion in revenue, $14.51 billion was generated by its AI/data center division. Q4 will probably be another record-setting quarter for the company, and coming up in Q2 2024, Nvidia will launch its next-gen AI chip, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/nvidia-introduces-its-most-powerful-gpu-yet-designed-for-accelerating-ai/\">HGX H200 Tensor Core GPU.</a> A <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20230530-11692.html\">TrendForce estimate</a> puts Nvidia's AI server market share at 60–70 percent.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003638#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003638&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"efe8c7c03429377dab7c6d044d76e6ea3198fdbecfdc089481992f8062ec7229","category":"Tech"}
