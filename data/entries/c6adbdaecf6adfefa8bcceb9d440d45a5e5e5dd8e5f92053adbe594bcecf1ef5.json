And after using a foldable-screen laptop as my primary PC for about four weeks, I'm not sure they're ready for prime time.</p>\n<p>I'm leaving my time with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/hps-5000-spectre-foldable-pc-has-a-lot-to-prove/\">HP's first foldable laptop</a> with a sense of anticipation for the future of laptops, which I think would benefit from a resurgence of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/dont-call-it-a-refresh-the-6-most-adventurous-laptop-designs-of-2022/\">creative ideas</a> that cater to the unique ways people use their computers. But I seriously question if the benefits of having a 17-inch screen in a 12-inch laptop body are worth the trade-offs inherent in today's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/the-first-foldable-pc-era-is-unfolding/\">foldable PCs</a>.</p>\n<p>Early participants in the foldable laptop world have an opportunity to define the space, while consumers can decide if this is something they even want. HP's foldable is the most beefed-up option ever, and weeks of use have shown me a lot about what I want and don't want to see when the dust settles.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978971#p3\">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978971&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c6adbdaecf6adfefa8bcceb9d440d45a5e5e5dd8e5f92053adbe594bcecf1ef5","category":"Tech"}
