{"title":"Massive Data Breach at AT&T Exposed Six Months of Call and SMS Records of Nearly All Customers","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/12/business/att-customers-massive-breach/index.html","date":1720809273000,"content":"\n<p>Matt Egan and Sean Lyngaas, reporting for CNN:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The call and text message records from mid-to-late 2022 of tens of\nmillions of AT&amp;T cellphone customers and many non-AT&amp;T customers\nwere exposed in a massive data breach, the telecom company\nrevealed Friday. AT&amp;T said the compromised data includes the\ntelephone numbers of “nearly all” of its cellular customers and\nthe customers of wireless providers that use its network between\nMay 1, 2022 and October 31, 2022.</p>\n\n<p>The stolen logs also contain a record of every number AT&amp;T\ncustomers called or texted — including customers of other\nwireless networks — the number of times they interacted, and the\ncall duration.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, AT&amp;T said the stolen data did not include the\ncontents of calls and text messages nor the time of those\ncommunications.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course the breach didn’t contain the content of phone calls and text messages, because carriers don’t record phone calls and, thankfully, don’t log the contents of text messages. This isn’t an important distinction at all. This is a devastating breach.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/12/att-massive-data-breach\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3a9d4b9dc6051d051e12cf9876e6111c149f0b512ba9ad11c98d2199f463d626","category":"Tech"}
