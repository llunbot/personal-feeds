And of course, it comes in the colorful Hope anodized range, plus a new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hope-tech-carbon-cranks-bronze-color/\" target=\"_blank\">bronze</a> to add a bit more flash to your ride. Plus, they’ve added another lacing option to their light &amp; wide alloy gravel wheels. And from now on, tubeless setup of their carbon road &amp; gravel wheels will be one step quicker and cheaper…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hope RX -15° machined alloy gravel &amp; XC stem </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_facse-plate-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_facse-plate-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hope RX -15° machined alloy gravel &amp; XC stem, blue faceplate\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_facse-plate-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_facse-plate-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_facse-plate-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_facse-plate-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Hope)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine a lightweight machined alloy Hope XC stem, but slammed down to get your bars lower. That’s exactly what you get with the new RX, designing it for “a more aggressive, race-focused geometry”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_blue-from-back-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_blue-from-back-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hope RX -15° machined alloy gravel &amp; XC stem, blue ano\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_blue-from-back-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_blue-from-back-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_blue-from-back-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_blue-from-back-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Splitting the length difference of the 0° XC stem, the new Hope RX stem is available in 80mm only, and -15° rise, and designed for gravel or cross-country. Hope CNC-machines the 2014-T6 aluminium stem in-house in Barnoldswick, UK. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing is the same as the cross-country version, as are the bolt options. Pick up a RX stem with stainless steel bolts for  £105 / $133 / 130€ starting October 1st. Or for about  £30 / 35€ extra you’ll be able to upgrade to titanium bolts. Weights should be ~143g with steel bolts, 131g with ti hardware. The new Hope RX gravel stem comes in black, silver, red, blue, orange &amp; purple ano, plus the newer bronze to match your Hope gravel hubs, headset, and upgraded brake calipers &amp; rotors.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_color-options-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_color-options-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hope RX 80mm x -15° machined alloy gravel &amp; XC stem, color options\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_color-options-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_color-options-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_color-options-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_color-options-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX-negative-rise-machined-alloy-gravel-bike-XC-stem_color-options-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And in reality, if your XC bike needs a bit of rise, you can always run the new RX upside down for a +15° angle as long as you don’t mind it saying “<em>adoy</em>” on the side of your stem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Hope RX24 gravel wheel options</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_MADE-show-bike-photo-by-adamgassonphoto-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_MADE-show-bike-photo-by-adamgassonphoto-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hope RX24 alloy aluminium gravel wheel options, now in 28H\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_MADE-show-bike-photo-by-adamgassonphoto-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_MADE-show-bike-photo-by-adamgassonphoto-297x186.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_MADE-show-bike-photo-by-adamgassonphoto-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_MADE-show-bike-photo-by-adamgassonphoto-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/adamgassonphoto\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Gasson</a>/Hope)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The update to Hope’s “lightest and widest” 700c alloy gravel wheel is a subtle one that’d be easy to miss. Unless you start counting spokes on your buddies’ wheels. Yes, the innovation here is 28 spokes – the perfect compromise between 24 or 32 spokes. All false exaggeration aside… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hope built a reasonably light (<em>from 1780g complete with 24 spokes</em>) 24mm internal x 23mm deep alloy wheelset for gravel riders with their excellent Pro 5 hubs, and initially offered it this past spring also with 32 spokes for heavier riders and loaded bikepacking. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_angled-wheel-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_angled-wheel-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hope RX24 alloy aluminium gravel wheel options\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_angled-wheel-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_angled-wheel-297x248.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_angled-wheel-120x100.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_angled-wheel-768x640.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But then, they realized that something in the middle would provide the best of both worlds in terms of lighter weight and added durability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter 28 spokes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_new-28-hole-lacing-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"724\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_new-28-hole-lacing-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Hope RX24 alloy aluminium gravel wheel options, rim detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_new-28-hole-lacing-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_new-28-hole-lacing-297x179.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_new-28-hole-lacing-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hope-RX24-alloy-gravel-wheel-options_new-28-hole-lacing-768x463.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also available from Oct 1 via Hope dealers, the RX24 gravel wheels now let you choose 24, 28 &amp; 32 double-butted black Sapim Race spokes and straight-pull or traditional J-bend.

It was already designed for tubeless. But now when you buy a RD40 wheelset it will come with Hope’s latest tubeless tape and tubeless valves at no extra cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here built with durable carbon hubs, centerlock Pro 5 straight pull hubs, and 24 black aero bladed Sapim CX-Ray spokes – all from start to finish by hand in Barnoldswick. RD40 wheels sell for £650 / $820 / 825€ front &amp; £725 / $915 / 925€ rear in the hub color &amp; freehub body of your choice through your local Hope dealers from October 1, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HopeTech.com</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hope-rx-adds-colorful-gravel-specific-stem-more-alloy-tubeless-ready-carbon-wheels/\">Hope RX Adds Colorful Gravel-Specific Stem, More Alloy &amp; Tubeless-Ready Carbon Wheels</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"2b145ed56518b033388e6a446cfa4cf030eaaf0a27c49be380e9361c67fbf2e4","category":"Cycling"}
