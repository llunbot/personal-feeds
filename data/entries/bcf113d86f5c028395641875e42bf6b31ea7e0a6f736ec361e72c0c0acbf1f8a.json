The case is easy to put on and take off the ‌iPhone‌, and there are handy shortcut keys for Spotlight search, webpage scrolling, and getting back to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWithings was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/ces-2024-withings-beamo/\">demoing the BeamO</a>, an all-in-one device that can take your temperature, capture an ECG, monitor blood oxygen, and even serve as a digital stethoscope, and there were Qi2 chargers galore from brands like Hyper, Anker, and ESR. Qi2 is the latest charging technology, and it's bringing more affordable 15W wireless charging to the ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTargus was showing off an ambidextrous mouse that can be used by both right and left-handed people, and the company also had a dock that can connect two laptops together with three monitors, serving as a KVM.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSony and Honda had the Afeela electric car on the show floor with its dozens of sensors for driver safety, and Dan also took note of the Barsys 360, a smart cocktail machine that mixes and pours bartender-grade drinks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnsurprisingly, there were a <em>ton</em> of AR/VR devices, some of which seemed to be inspired by the Vision Pro. One standout was the <a href=\"https://www.xreal.com\">XREAL AR Glasses</a>, but they're only compatible with Samsung's latest smartphones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCES is just about wrapped up with the show coming to a close on Friday, but make sure to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/\">check out our CES 2024 hub</a> for anything that you might have missed.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/\">CES 2024</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/12/ces-2024-day-3-recap/\">CES 2024 Day 3: Clicks iPhone Keyboard, Qi2 Chargers, AR Glasses and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-day-3-clicks-iphone-keyboard-qi2-chargers-ar-glasses-and-more.2416160/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bcf113d86f5c028395641875e42bf6b31ea7e0a6f736ec361e72c0c0acbf1f8a","category":"Apple"}
