And as a birthday present, it has designed what it says could be the future of its sports cars—a new design study called Mission X. It's the latest in a series of one-off concepts and technology demonstrators; these give us a good idea of what the German brand is thinking when it comes to high-performance electric vehicles. Should this one go into production, it promises plenty.
