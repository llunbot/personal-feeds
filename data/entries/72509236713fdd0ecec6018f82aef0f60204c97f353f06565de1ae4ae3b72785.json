Users can also create and save their own custom walking and hiking routes, with one-way, out-and-back, and loop routing options to choose from where available. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Maps added topographic maps on the Apple Watch with watchOS 10 last year, and these maps are now available on the iPhone too with iOS 18. Topographic maps and hikes can be saved for offline access with turn-by-turn voice guidance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese features are mostly limited to the U.S., but topographic maps are also available in Japan, according to fine print <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-18-preview/\">on Apple's website</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is how Apple describes all of the features:<blockquote>Apple Maps introduces even more ways to explore the world, including hikes and custom walking routes. Users can browse thousands of hikes across national parks in the United States — filtered by length, elevation, and route type — and save them to use while offline. Users can also create their own custom walking routes with just a few taps to plan everything from a local exercise route to a full-day walking tour in a new city. Additionally, they can save their favorite national park hikes, custom walking routes, and places to an all-new Places Library, and add personal notes about them.</blockquote><em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/\">Aaron Perris</a> exclusively revealed that these features were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/ios-18-topographic-maps/\">coming to Apple Maps on the iPhone</a> earlier this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18 is currently in beta and should be released in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/apple-maps-hiking-features-on-ios-18/\">Apple Maps Rivals AllTrails on iOS 18 With New Hiking Features in U.S.</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-maps-rivals-alltrails-on-ios-18-with-new-hiking-features-in-u-s.2429049/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"72509236713fdd0ecec6018f82aef0f60204c97f353f06565de1ae4ae3b72785","category":"Apple"}
