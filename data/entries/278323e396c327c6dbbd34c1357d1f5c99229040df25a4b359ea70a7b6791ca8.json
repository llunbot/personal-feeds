The 5th generation carbon Troy frames feature increased travel and revised suspension kinematics, more aggressive geometry, a more streamlined frame design, and in-frame storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last fall, I wrote a review of the updated aluminum <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/devinci-troy-gx-axs-12s-review/\">Troy</a></strong>, which impressed me with its suspension performance, trail-appropriate geometry, and in-frame storage. At that time, Devinci confirmed that a 5th-generation carbon version was on the way. The carbon Troys are now ready to ride, so let’s check out all the specs and details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 Devinci Troy Carbon – Frame Features:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump-turn.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump-turn.webp\" alt=\"2025 Devinci Troy Carbon, jump turn\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump-turn.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump-turn-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump-turn-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump-turn-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump-turn-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump-turn-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re not familiar, the Troy is Devinci’s all-mountain bike, offering 150 mm of rear travel and a 160mm fork. This bumps up the new Troy’s travel from the previous version’s 140/150mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gen 5 frame is constructed from Optimum-Strength Carbon. Devinci uses an advanced tuning process combining high-strength and high-modulus carbon layups to achieve a stiff, durable frame. The redesigned Troy Carbon features a sleeker overall design with a straighter top tube. The new design eliminates the upsweep in the previous frame’s top tube where it met the seat tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-linkage.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-linkage.webp\" alt=\"2025 Devinci Troy Carbon, Split Pivot linkage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-linkage.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-linkage-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-linkage-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-linkage-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-linkage-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-linkage-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Troy features Devinci’s Split Pivot suspension linkage. This linkage separates acceleration and braking forces, and offers excellent small bump sensitivity while maintaining strong pedaling efficiency. The Troy’s linkage is also progressive enough to work well with coil shocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-shock-link.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-shock-link.webp\" alt=\"2025 Devinci Troy Carbon, shock and link\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-shock-link.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-shock-link-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-shock-link-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-shock-link-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-shock-link-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-shock-link-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Troy uses a trunnion-mount rear shock, and the rocker link was designed not to require any extra spacers. To ensure long-lasting, smooth suspension performance, Devinci uses Enduro double-lip sealed bearings in their frames’ pivot points. Strategically chosen pivot points feature double-row bearings to increase rigidity.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-flip-chip.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-flip-chip.webp\" alt=\"2025 Devinci Troy Carbon, flip chip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-flip-chip.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-flip-chip-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-flip-chip-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-flip-chip-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-flip-chip-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-flip-chip-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All frame sizes are compatible with 29” or MX wheels, but the two complete Troy Carbon builds come set up with MX wheelsets. A ‘Geo Saver’ flip-chip at the lower shock mount maintains the same frame geometry for either option. The only exception is putting a 29” rear wheel in does increase the bike’s rear end length and wheelbase by 2- 3 mm. There is also the option of running either flip-chip setting with a 29” wheelset (but not MX!). Read on for more info in the geometry section below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-SHED-storage.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-SHED-storage.webp\" alt=\"2025 Devinci Troy Carbon, SHED frame storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-SHED-storage.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-SHED-storage-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-SHED-storage-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-SHED-storage-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-SHED-storage-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-SHED-storage-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Devinci gave the carbon Troys their new SHED in-frame storage compartment, which offers ample room in the downtube for stashing trailside tools, supplies, and maybe some snacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fitments and Finishing Touches:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-cable-routing.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-cable-routing.webp\" alt=\"2025 Devinci Troy Carbon, cable routing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-cable-routing.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-cable-routing-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-cable-routing-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-cable-routing-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-cable-routing-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-cable-routing-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For easy maintenance, the carbon Troy features fully guided internal cable routing. Straight-entry ports at the head tube look slick and prevent cable rub on the frame. There is one water bottle mount on the SHED storage door, and all frame sizes can run a 500ml bottle or larger (with a reservoir shock).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for dropper posts, small Troy frames come with 150mm posts, mediums run 170mm, and L/XL frames get 200mm posts. The Troy Carbon frame accepts 31.6mm diameter posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-chainstay.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-chainstay.webp\" alt=\"2025 Devinci Troy Carbon, chainstay\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-chainstay.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-chainstay-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-chainstay-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-chainstay-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-chainstay-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-chainstay-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Key fitments include a threaded BB shell with 3-bolt ISCG05 chain guide mounts, SRAM UDH compatible dropouts, and a Boost 148mm rear axle. The frame offers chainring clearance for up to 34t front rings, and ample tire clearance for 29×2.5” or 27.5×2.6” treads. Downtube and chainstay protectors keep paint damage and chain slap to a minimum.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-geometry-chart.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-geometry-chart.webp\" alt=\"2025 Devinci Troy Carbon geometry chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-geometry-chart.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-geometry-chart-297x181.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-geometry-chart-120x73.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-geometry-chart-768x467.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Troy Carbon frame gets a slacker head tube, steeper seat tube, longer wheelbase, and lower standover height vs the Gen 4 frame. The Troy’s reach is up to modern spec but not super long, while rear ends are on the shorter side. Standover heights are identical across all frame sizes, so you can choose your size based on your preference for stability vs. agility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Geo Saver flip chip is designed to accommodate MX wheels in its Hi position and 29” wheels in its Lo position. However, with matched 29” wheels, you can run the chip in Hi to get a longer, steeper geometry setting. This configuration increases the frame’s reach, BB height, and standover height significantly, and slightly steepens the steering and seat mast angles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-close-forest.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-close-forest.webp\" alt=\"2025 Devinci Troy Carbon, close up, forest\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-close-forest.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-close-forest-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-close-forest-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-close-forest-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-close-forest-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-close-forest-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The carbon Troy’s geometry is almost identical to the aluminum frames: All key angles and measurements are the same, but there are two differences to note. The re-shaped carbon frames offer a lower standover height, and while the aluminum Troy got two different chainstay lengths across all frame sizes, the carbon Troys get three rear end lengths.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Model Lineup:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump.webp\" alt=\"2025 Devinci Troy Carbon, jump\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-Devinci-Troy-Carbon-jump-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Devinci is offering two complete Troy Carbon models, with SRAM’s GX AXS or Eagle 90 drivetrains.
