As a result, he said the foldable MacBook could be nearly as expensive as Apple's Vision Pro headset, which starts at $3,499. The 16-inch MacBook Pro currently starts at $2,499.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo estimated that foldable MacBook shipments will exceed one million units in 2026, suggesting that the device will launch in around two years from now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe expects the device to feature Apple's next-generation M5 chip, which has yet to be announced.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo is one of three sources to have mentioned a 20-inch MacBook, alongside <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/31/apple-foldable-notebook-2025/\">display industry analyst Ross Young</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/apple-20-inch-display-future-macbook-pro/\">Korean website <em>The Elec</em></a>.
