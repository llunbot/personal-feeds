We’re all ready for the weekend, so let’s get on with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always it’s been a busy week at <em>Cyclist</em>, with lots of content published and lots of content in the works. Big hitters include Ewan’s ranking of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-50-best-mens-road-cyclists-of-the-2020s-so-far\" target=\"_blank\">50 best male riders of the 2020s so far</a>, the latest episode of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/joanna-rowsell-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">podcast with Joanna Rowsell</a>, and a big list of great <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/gifts-for-cyclists-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Christmas gifts for cyclists</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also had loads of review content, including a buyer’s guide of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-saddle-bags\" target=\"_blank\">best saddle bags</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/type/review\" target=\"_blank\">tests of plenty of bib tights and long sleeve jerseys</a> that will keep on coming through all of next week too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, we <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/atelier-pariah\" target=\"_blank\">spoke to Atelier Pariah’s Swanee Ravonison</a> about her work-of-art bike from last year’s Bespoked show, went back in time to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/connie-carpenter-phinney-1984-olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Connie Carpenter-Phinney winning the first women’s Olympic road race in 1984</a>, and revisited our feature on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/lotus-110-bike\" target=\"_blank\">the history of the Lotus 110</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally it’s Black Friday season and the deals are coming thick and fast. We’ve kicked off the season with a list of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/decathlon-black-friday-deals-2024\">Decathlon’s best cycling deals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Universal Colours Mono insulated jacket</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-970x728.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter is very much on the way, and that means it’s time to get your layers sorted again. Easy solution: Universal Colours’ new Mono insulated jacket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has a lovely PrimaLoft insulation on the inside, which is incredibly cosy and warm for single digit temperatures, while also packing up into its own pcoket and being stretchy enough thanks to the recycled nylon shell to allow ample movement. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-2-970x728.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-2-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-2-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-2-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-2.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it’s well insulated, it’s also breathable enough so it’s not stuffy, and has C0 DWR coating on the outside to keep out light rain, and Universal Colours says it’s ideal to wear with just a long sleeve base layer underneath – who needs jerseys when you have jackets like these?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who aren’t so keen on this ‘golden beige’, it also comes in black. But I like this one and colours – especially universal ones – are great for darker seasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy it now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25809&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sigmasports.com%2Fitem%2FUniversal-Colours%2FMono-Insulated-Jacket%2F134MR\" target=\"_blank\">Sigma Sports (£190)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-50-best-mens-road-cyclists-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 50 best men’s road cyclists of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/50-best-women-cyclists-2020s\">The top 50 women’s road cyclists of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/shimano-rc703-shoes\">In the Drops: Super-wide Bontrager wheels, Silca’s waxing one-stop-shop, Shimano shoes and eco-friendly sunglasses</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/gifts-for-cyclists-2025\">31 perfect gift ideas for your favourite cyclist this Christmas</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Koo Hype sunglasses</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/koo-hype-970x728.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/koo-hype-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/koo-hype-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/koo-hype-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/koo-hype-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/koo-hype-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/koo-hype-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/koo-hype-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I received these glasses in a box locked with a three digit combination code and was told I’d have to wait almost a week to receive the numbers to get me in. Ten minutes later I’d cracked the code and found these lovely purple sunglasses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from that I’m not sure why they’re called ‘Hype’ but I am sure that they’re Koo’s latest invention made for use by the Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe team.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-koo-hype-glasses-970x728.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-koo-hype-glasses-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-koo-hype-glasses-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-koo-hype-glasses-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-koo-hype-glasses-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-koo-hype-glasses-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-koo-hype-glasses-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket-koo-hype-glasses.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The main headline is about ventilation. The little holes over the nose and at the sides are part of the design Koo calls a ‘Maximum Ventilation System’, however in the time I’ve been wearing them so far the lens is the standout. It’s a Zeiss Toric lens that’s curved for maximum field of vision and is actually a single lens despite looking like two. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of all that they feel secure, look good and are compatible with Koo’s Optical Clip to fit prescription lenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>But it now from <a href=\"https://kooworld.cc/uk/en/product/sunglasses/hype/\" target=\"_blank\">Koo (£180)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Quoc All Season Toe Covers and Winter Overshoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/quoc-toe-covers-970x728.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/quoc-toe-covers-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/quoc-toe-covers-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/quoc-toe-covers-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/quoc-toe-covers-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/quoc-toe-covers-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/quoc-toe-covers-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/quoc-toe-covers-1140x855.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>White shoe fans unite, it’s that cursed time of the year when the roads bring danger to your shine whenever you leave the house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Quoc’s M3 Air shoes are actually easy to clean and keep white, extra protection is still a good idea, especially in cold weather, and the brand has two offerings for varying winter conditions: the All Season Toe Covers and Winter Overshoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The toe covers are made from a neoprene/kevlar combo for weather protection with reflective details and a sewn border edge for a tidy finish.

They’re made from the same materials as the toe covers to make them waterproof and windproof, with a big reflective logo at the back. They’re stretchy with a Velcro strap at the bottom for a secure fit that’s easy enough to get on, and the sole has an added durable layer to prevent any damage while walking.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>But the All Season Toe Covers from <a href=\"https://quoc.cc/collections/toe-covers-overshoes/products/toe-cover\" target=\"_blank\">Quoc (£39)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy the Winter Overshoes from <a href=\"https://quoc.cc/collections/toe-covers-overshoes/products/overshoe\" target=\"_blank\">Quoc (£95)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Zwift Camp: Baseline</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/zwift-baseline-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"zwift baseline mock graphics\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/zwift-baseline-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/zwift-baseline-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/zwift-baseline-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/zwift-baseline-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/zwift-baseline-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/zwift-baseline-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/zwift-baseline.jpg 1920w\" /><figcaption>Zwift</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s time to get ahead of any potential Christmas fitness drop – and the mad January rush and ‘new year, new me’ that will inevitably follow. You may still be riding outside but this is about training. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zwift has launched Zwift Camp: Baseline, a new training programme that consists of five stages covering sprinting, attacking and endurance to gather your data for a tailored Rider Strength Report, which will tell you what your strengths and weaknesses are and provide recommendations to help make gains in the new year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each stage will be live for a week starting from 18th November, running on the hour, every hour, and while the longest ones are only an hour long, half-size versions will be available for the longer stages for those that need to save the time. All stages will be available from 29th December to 5th January for those that miss any along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.zwift.com/uk/zwift-camp\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up at zwift.com</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into this week: birthdays and playlist #24</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There were three birthdays on the <em>Cyclist </em>team this week, so my present to them is keeping this bit brief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My most recent new music playlist is now live and features the return of classic Bon Iver, Michael Kiwanuka, Declan McKenna, LCD Soundsystem, Sam Fender, Laura Marling, and the world’s best band: Do Nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5YiwYvCbDQUU8fPbT24KMp?si=1aLVuohCR7KWKBDCHipyfw\" target=\"_blank\">In the Drops #24 on Spotify</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/1151659770/playlists\" target=\"_blank\">all my In the Drops playlists</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-50-best-mens-road-cyclists-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 50 best men’s road cyclists of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/50-best-women-cyclists-2020s\">The top 50 women’s road cyclists of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/shimano-rc703-shoes\">In the Drops: Super-wide Bontrager wheels, Silca’s waxing one-stop-shop, Shimano shoes and eco-friendly sunglasses</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/gifts-for-cyclists-2025\">31 perfect gift ideas for your favourite cyclist this Christmas</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/universal-colours-mono-insulated-jacket\">In the Drops: Universal Colours insulated jacket, cool Koo glasses, Quoc shoe and toe covers, Zwift Baseline and birthdays</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d10d4e32a976689adebb38cb49d82a4b2a05c50b83b98e2adff1be3ed47c7b6a","category":"Cycling"}
