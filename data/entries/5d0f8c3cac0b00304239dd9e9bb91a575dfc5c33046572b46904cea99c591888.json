{"title":"The FIT File Podcast is Back!","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/01/fit-file-podcast-back.html","date":1706169239000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>Yup, you heard that right – the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/podcast\">FIT File Podcast is back</a>, and this time with video too! As always, we’ll be digesting the week’s sports tech news with a bit more debate, and geekery nuance than we might in our respective reviews. Plus, we’ll talk about things that might not be in a review yet. And as with before, it’ll be packed with plenty of tidbits on how things actually work behind the sports tech industry.</p>\n<p>The format will be familiar to past episodes, and probably some of the cast as well. For this reboot, Des (of DesFit) and I are hosts, but we’re going to have others from time to time. For example, from time to time, we’ll drag back in Shane Miller (GPLAMA) and others. Further, we’ll occasionally have deep-dive interviews with experts on various bits of sports tech, digging far deeper than normal on a specific topic or product area.</p>\n<p>Now this time around, all of the episodes are recorded both audio and video. You can see the first episode up on the new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@thefitfile\">FIT File Podcast YouTube channel</a> (above), or down below with numerous podcast platforms.
