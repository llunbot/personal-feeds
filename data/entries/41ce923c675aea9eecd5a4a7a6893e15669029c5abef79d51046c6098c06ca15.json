The new firmware is the same 6A321 version that was released for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/airpods-3-firmware-6a321/\">third-generation AirPods last week</a> and is up from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-new-airpods-firmware-2//\">6A300 firmware</a> introduced last September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/AirPods-Pro-Firmware-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2322\" height=\"1306\" />\r<br />\nApple's AirPods firmware updates often do not come with details on new features, so it is unclear what might be included in the software. For last week's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 3</a> update with this firmware version, Apple listed only \"bug fixes and other improvements.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can check your ‌‌‌‌AirPods Pro‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ firmware version by following these steps:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌AirPods Pro‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ to your iOS device.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Open the Settings app.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Tap General.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Tap About.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Look at the number next to \"Firmware Version.\"</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nIf we learn more about what's new in the AirPods firmware release, we'll update this article.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/airpods-pro-1-firmware-6a321/\">Apple Releases Updated Firmware for First-Generation AirPods Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-updated-firmware-for-first-generation-airpods-pro.2417229/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"41ce923c675aea9eecd5a4a7a6893e15669029c5abef79d51046c6098c06ca15","category":"Apple"}
