Musk is famously a fan of the letter X, applying it to everything from his companies to his children's names.</p>\n<p>The branding change comes about three months after Musk officially <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/04/twitter-no-longer-exists-as-a-company-merges-into-musks-x-corp/\">replaced Twitter the company</a> with a successor firm called X Corp. Over the weekend, Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1682964919325724673\">wrote</a> that \"soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,\" and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1682965462886535168\">invited users</a> to come up with a new logo. He also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683055552404897792\">wrote</a> that a tweet will now be called an \"X,\" and noted that his X.com domain now redirects to Twitter.</p>\n<p>Musk chose a logo offered by a Twitter user but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683324132853686272\">wrote</a> that it will probably be changed later and \"certainly will be refined.\" The X logo was suggested yesterday by Sawyer Merritt, who initially <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1683150433806692352\">said</a> it had been used for a now-discontinued <a href=\"https://www.callin.com/show/aRGmMAOqzw\">podcast about Musk</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956102#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956102&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5a2b372fdc5799d831cd4e5b5df9267418091e7982bb3858a4b560c67f75f53c","category":"Tech"}
