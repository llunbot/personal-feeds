FUELL Flluid-2 & Flluid-3 Include VALEO Motor + Predictive Shifting","link":"https://bikerumor.com/longest-range-ebike-fuell-flluid-2-flluid-3-valeo-motor-predictive-shifting/","date":1680721445000,"content":"<p>Expanding upon their initial Flluid-1 ebike, FUELL has just announced two new models – The Flluid-2, claiming to offer the world’s longest range, and the Flluid-3. FUELL’s designs are overseen by their CTO Erik Buell, who is a former Harley Davidson engineer and founder of the BUELL Motorcycle Company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the aim to get people out of cars (and even off motorcycles), FUELL has designed ebikes that provide long ranges and simplicity for the rider. The new Flluid-2 and 3 ebikes are powered by VALEO Cyclee mid-drive motors linked to an automatic gearbox with predictive shifting. They also feature low-maintenance Gates belt drive systems.  The Flluid-2 carries two batteries to offer a massive range of up to 225 miles, while the Flluid-3 still provides about half that range with a single battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FUELL Flluid-2 and Flluid-3 – Electronics:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-motor.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-motor-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-motor-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-motor-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-motor-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-motor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-motor-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-motor.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Flluid-2 and 3 are both powered by a VALEO Cyclee mid-drive motor that provides a maximum 750W of power (1000W for EU models) and 130Nm of torque. The motor is connected to an auto-shifting gearbox that offers 7 speeds which provides a 450% gear range. However, if you prefer to shift yourself the auto-shifting function can be turned off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both bikes come with a throttle as well as pedal assist… unless you live in Europe, where the throttle is not available. Throttle mode provides power up to 20mph. To meet varying global regulations, there are four versions for the two bikes; The standard Flluid-2 and Flluid-3 max out at 20mph (USA) or 25km/h (EU), but the Flluid-2S and Flluid-3S models will assist you up to 28mph or 45km/h.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-display.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-display-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-display-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-display-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-display-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-display-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-display-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-2-display.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>FUELL’s 2.3” display unit is located on top of the stem, and its 3-button controller sits inside the right grip. The display unit shows your speed, distance, battery capacity, assistance level, which gear you’re in, lock status, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The batteries in both bikes are 1000Wh, 51.8V units. FUELL’s 3 amp fast charger tops them up to 80% in 4 hours and fully charges the battery in 6 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-3-rider-w-app.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-3-rider-w-app-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-3-rider-w-app-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-3-rider-w-app-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-3-rider-w-app-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-3-rider-w-app-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-3-rider-w-app-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FUELL-Flluid-3-rider-w-app.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A connectivity system hidden inside the frames allows the FUELL Rider app to lock/unlock the bikes, send warnings in case of unusual movements (theft), and track the bikes’ location.
