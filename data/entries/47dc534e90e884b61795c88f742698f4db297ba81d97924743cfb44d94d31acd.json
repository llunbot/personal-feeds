There's also a $49 <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLYV3AM/A/usb-c-to-magsafe-3-cable-2-m\">USB-C to MagSafe 3 cable</a> for charging the MacBook Pro.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCombined, it's going to cost right around $150 to get a new charging setup for the 16-inch MacBook Pro machines should you need a secondary power adapter and cable, though charging is still possible using a USB-C port and cable instead of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a>. You do get an initial set with the purchase of a new MacBook Pro, however. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new ‌MagSafe‌ cable and 140W power adapter are required to take advantage of fast charging, which allows a MacBook Pro to charge from zero to 50 percent in 30 minutes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌MagSafe‌ also has the benefit of a quick release feature should someone pull on the cable or trip over it accidentally. Both new accessories can be purchased from the online <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a> as of today and will arrive next week.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/apple-magsafe-cable-140w-power-adapter-macbook-pro/\">Apple Selling New $49 MagSafe Cable and $99 140W Power Adapter for 16-Inch MacBook Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-selling-new-49-magsafe-cable-and-99-140w-power-adapter-for-16-inch-macbook-pro.2317584/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zgK-2yu01MQ:g_PSkcK6YWg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zgK-2yu01MQ:g_PSkcK6YWg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/zgK-2yu01MQ\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"47dc534e90e884b61795c88f742698f4db297ba81d97924743cfb44d94d31acd","category":"Apple"}
