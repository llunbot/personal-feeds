The new Fox Speedframe won’t even be available until sometime around mid-March, but they’ve already climbed to the top of the latest bicycle helmet ratings from VT with the Speedframe RS taking the top spot, and the Speedframe Pro taking #2 (more on the differences below). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, the consumer launch for the new helmets won’t be until later this spring, but you’ll be seeing the Speedframe on Fox athletes soon, so Fox has added it to their website and have sent out product samples. We ended up with one of the new Speedframe Pro models, and there’s a lot to like (assuming the fit works for you). </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why do the helmet models rank differently?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-04.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-04-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Fox Speedframe helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-04-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-04-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-04-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-04-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-04-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-04-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-04-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re wondering why two of the same model helmets would rank differently based on the version, the answer seems to come down to the MIPS variation used in each helmet. The top ranked Speedframe RS uses the Mips Integra Split system (two different density shells with a low friction layer between them), while the Speedframe Pro uses the Mips Air Node, and the base model Speedframe uses a standard Mips system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While all three <a href=\"https://www.helmet.beam.vt.edu/bicycle-helmet-ratings.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fox Speedframe helmets land a 5-star rating from Virginia Tech</a>, their overall score is calculated beyond the 5-star rating with the lowest score supposedly offering the most protection. That’s how they came up with the Speedframe RS in the top spot with a 7.23 score, while the Pro was close behind in second with an 8.10. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, the base model Speedframe still carries a 5-star rating, but the actual score of 13.39 lands it much further down on the VT list at #137. This is interesting to us as it uses a Mips system that at one time was considered cutting edge. That seems to reinforce the fact that Mips has continued to evolve and create new and better systems that may offer improved protection for the rider. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth pointing out that it’s not just the Mips system that’s likely responsible for the improved protection, but the inclusion of dual-density foam in both the RS and the Pro model. The RS uses a two-shell system, each with different densities. The Pro uses their dual-density Varizorb EPS with the two densities molded into one shell. The base model Speedframe appears to have a single density EPS shell which would likely account for the difference in VT rating. Currently, only the Speedframe RS model states that it meets the NTA 8776 ebike standard, but we haven’t seen an official press kit for the helmets yet so that may change. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-02.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-02-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Fox Speedframe helmet BOA\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-02-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-02-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-02-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-02-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-02-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-02-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fox-Speedframe-helmet-actual-weight-first-look-BOA-02-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The top two helmets also include a more premium fit system with a BOA dial and a soft cord in place of the typical plastic band.
