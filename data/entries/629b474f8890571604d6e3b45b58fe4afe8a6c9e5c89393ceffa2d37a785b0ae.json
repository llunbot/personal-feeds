Image Wand is the feature that allows users to add a drawing to written notes, either by sketching out an idea or referencing words in the note. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple did recently remove sketch from the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image-playground/id6479176117\">Image Playground app description</a>, but that's just because it's not yet in the ‌Image Playground‌ app. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nSketch is described as a \"highly detailed and academic\" style that \"produces gorgeous drawings on stark backgrounds.\" It is distinct from the illustration style that has strong outlines, bold colors, and simple shapes, and the animation style that has a \"whimsical, 3D cartoon look.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Image Playground‌ and Image Wand will be released to the public in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a> in December. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>Update:</b> This article has been updated to clarify that the sketch style has not been removed entirely and that it will be coming to ‌Image Playground‌ at a later time. The prior version of this article suggested that sketch had been entirely removed. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/apple-removes-sketch-from-image-playground/\">'Sketch' Style Option Still Coming to Image Playground [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sketch-style-option-still-coming-to-image-playground-updated.2442286/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"629b474f8890571604d6e3b45b58fe4afe8a6c9e5c89393ceffa2d37a785b0ae","category":"Apple"}
