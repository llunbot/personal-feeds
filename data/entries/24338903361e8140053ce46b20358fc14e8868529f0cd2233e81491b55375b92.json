{"title":"Giro d'Italia 2025 stage 12 preview: A fast finish","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/giro-ditalia-2025-stage-12-preview","date":1747840136000,"content":"\n      <p><span><strong>Date</strong>: Thursday, May 22<br /></span><span><strong>Distance</strong>: 172km<br /></span><span><strong>Start location</strong>: Modena<br /></span><span><strong>Finish location</strong>: Viadana<br /></span><span><strong>Start time</strong>: 13:15 CEST<br /></span><span><strong>Finish time</strong>: 17:15 CEST (approx.)</span></p>\n<p><span>From today until the mountainous stage 15 that brings an end to the second week in three days' time, the GC race is set to go on hold. These stages take place in the Po Valley, the flat landscape nestled between the Apennines to the south, where much of the climbing so far of this <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/giro-ditalia\">Giro d'Italia</a> has taken place, and the Alps to the north, where the race is heading for the final phase of the race. Home to about a third of Italy’s 60 million population, the Po Valley has been the industrial heartbeat of the nation since the ‘economic miracle’ the nation enjoyed following the Second World War. </span></p>\n<p><span>Stage 12 sets off from Modena, most associated with the automotive industry. Manufacturers of luxury vehicles such as Maserati, Pagani, and Stanguellini all originate from here, as does perhaps the most famous of all — Ferrari. The company’s founder, Enzo Ferrari, was born here, and created what would eventually become the most successful team in Formula One. His old house in Modena has now been turned into a museum. And for those who prefer a more tuneful noise than that generated by his cars, the beloved tenor Luciano Pavarotti is another of Modena’s most famous sons.</span></p>\n<p><span>From Modena, the riders head south-west, before changing direction northwards to move into Lombardy for a finish in Viadana. They will first cross the finish line 145km into the stage, before heading north for a 26.6km loop before returning again. Entirely flat and without any complicating factors, this finishing circuit should ensure the sprinters have an opportunity for a stage win.</span></p>\n<p><span>Or will it? While the finishing circuit is flat, the first half of the stage isn’t, offering encouragement for the breakaway. The category three Baiso is tackled 40km into the stage, and is far from easy at 5.1km averaging 5.7%, after which the road undulates for another 60km, including a second category three climb, Borsea. This is the kind of territory in which a strong breakaway of puncheurs and rouleurs can go clear, and build themselves an advantage to potentially make it to the finish. </span></p>\n<p><span>It will need to be a very big advantage, however, as the final 70km to the finish following the descent of Borsea are pan flat. Given how long it has been since the fastmen have had a chance to unleash their legs for a sprint finish, you can’t expect them to let this opportunity slip, and their teammates should be well-rested enough to chase down even a strong breakaway group. </span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/giro-stage-12-profile_1024x1024.jpg?v=1747667127\" alt=\"Giro d'Italia 2025 stage 12 profile\" /></div>\n<div><br /></div>\n<h3>Contenders</h3>\n<div>Stage 12 is a chance for the sprinters, who have had to endure five stages without an opportunity for victory. Some are already on the scoreboard but some have so far missed out on an important win for their teams. With three stages already at this Giro, <strong>Mads Pedersen</strong> (Lidl-Trek) is looking for his chance to add to his tally and his <em>maglia ciclamino</em> lead, a competition which looks to be sewn up halfway through this race. Stage four winner <strong>Casper van Uden</strong> (Team Picnic PostNL) will be hoping his team can deliver him to the finale in a good position like they did in Lecce. <strong>Kaden Groves</strong> (Alpecin-Deceuninck) has been working himself into good shape, and got a morale-boosting win in Napoli.</div>\n<div>\n<br /><strong>Olav Kooij’</strong>s (Team Visma-Lease a Bike) best result so far was second on stage four, but thanks to <strong>Wout van Aert</strong>’s rousing win in Siena, his team have got an all important stage win but will now be hungry for more. <strong>Sam Bennett</strong>’s Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale squad are in a different position with nothing yet to cheer about at this Giro and the Irishman will be hoping to change that. </div>\n<div>\n<br />This Grand Tour has already thrown up some surprises in the sprint finishes, with several lesser-known riders making their mark—Van Uden’s victory being a prime example. <strong>Max Kanter</strong> (XDS Astana Team) managed to outsprint Groves and Bennett on stage four but was later relegated for unsafe riding. Meanwhile, riders like <strong>Orluis Aular </strong>(Movistar Team), <strong>Corbin Strong</strong> (Israel-Premier Tech), and <strong>Maikel Zijlaard</strong> (Tudor Pro Cycling Team) have all impressed and could emerge as unexpected threats in the upcoming stage. Ineos Grenadiers' <strong>Ben Turner </strong>may try his luck in the sprint or even with an early move.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Young Frenchman <strong>Paul Magnier</strong> (Soudal Quick-Step) hasn't managed to deliver on his potential yet at this Grand Tour but the latter half of the Giro could represent a chance for him.</div>\n<div></div>\n<h3>Prediction</h3>\n<p>We think Kaden Groves will claim his second stage of this Giro. </p>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"24338903361e8140053ce46b20358fc14e8868529f0cd2233e81491b55375b92","category":"Cycling"}
