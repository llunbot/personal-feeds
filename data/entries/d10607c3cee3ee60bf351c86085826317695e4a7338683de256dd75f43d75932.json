She rode east from Chicago to New Jersey, then from Portugal up to the Netherlands before going south through Germany and Switzerland into northern Italy. From there she continued east via Turkey to Tbilisi in Georgia. After that she went south to ride across Australia from Perth to Brisbane along the south coast and then hopped across to ride the length of New Zealand from Invercargill to Auckland. From there Wilcox headed home to Alaska, starting in Anchorage and heading south all the way to Los Angeles before the final leg east back to Chicago. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All flights and public transit taken are included in the time taken, and are within the Guinness rules so long as the journey is continuous in one direction – in this case west to east – with a minimum total distance ridden of 29,000km and total distance travelled of 40,100km.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/2024-Around-the-World-%E2%80%94-Day-76-%E2%80%94-Tetlin-Junction-Alaska-to-Destruction-Bay-Yukon-Cananda-%E2%80%94-Edits-10-970x647.jpg\" /><figcaption>SRAM</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilcox beats the previous record set by Scotland’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/jenny-graham-qa-alone-around-the-globe-in-110-days\" target=\"_blank\">Jenny Graham</a> in 2018 of 124 days, 10 hours and 50 minutes. The BBC reported that Graham cheered Wilcox on, saying, ‘It’s the most amazing thing to see women out there pushing their sport the way they want to. I’m just a massive fan.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The achievement is another in a long line for Wilcox, who broke the women’s record for the Tour Divide in 2015 and a year later became the first American and the first woman to win the Trans Am Bike Race across the United States in 18 days.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ultracycling-ride-around-the-world\">So you want to ride around the world?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/qa-lael-wilcox\">‘I want to give kids a handlebar to hold instead of their phone’: Interview with ultracyclist Lael Wilcox </a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-icelands-continental-divide-jenny-graham-and-lael-wilcox-new-documentary\">Cycling Iceland’s Continental Divide : Jenny Graham and Lael Wilcox new documentary</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/jenny-graham-qa-alone-around-the-globe-in-110-days\">Jenny Graham Q&amp;A: Alone around the globe in 110 days</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/lael-wilcox-circumnavigation-record\">Lael Wilcox sets new women’s round-the-world record</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d10607c3cee3ee60bf351c86085826317695e4a7338683de256dd75f43d75932","category":"Cycling"}
