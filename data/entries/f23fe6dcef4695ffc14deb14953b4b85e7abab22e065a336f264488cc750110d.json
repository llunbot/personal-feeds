The solar farm’s shape follows the path of a canal, with panels serving as awnings to shade the gently flowing water from the unforgiving heat and wind of the Sonoran Desert.</p>\n<p>The panels began generating power last November for the Akimel O’otham and Pee Posh tribes—known together as the Gila River Indian Community, or GRIC—on their reservation in south-central Arizona, and they are the first of their kind in the US. The community is studying the effects of these panels on the water in the canal, hopeful that they will protect a precious resource from the desert’s unflinching sun and wind.</p>\n<p>In September, GRIC is planning to break ground on another experimental effort to conserve water while generating electricity: floating solar. Between its canal canopies and the new project that would float photovoltaic panels on a reservoir it is building, GRIC hopes to one day power all of its canal and irrigation operations with solar electricity, transforming itself into one of the most innovative and closely watched water users in the West in the process.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/can-floating-solar-panels-on-a-reservoir-help-the-colorado-river/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/can-floating-solar-panels-on-a-reservoir-help-the-colorado-river/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jake Bolster, Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f23fe6dcef4695ffc14deb14953b4b85e7abab22e065a336f264488cc750110d","category":"Tech"}
