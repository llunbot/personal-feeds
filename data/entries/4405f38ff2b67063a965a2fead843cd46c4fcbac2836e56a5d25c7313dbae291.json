The app continues to show algorithmically recommended posts under the \"For you\" tab.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/threads-following-tab.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe addition of a \"Following\" tab brings Threads more in line with its rival Twitter, and it will make the app more useful for keeping track of the latest posts in real time. The new tab is still in the process of rolling out as a server-side change, so it is not yet visible to all users, but updating the app and tapping the home button in the bottom menu might help.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeta <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/05/instagram-threads-app-now-available/\">launched Threads earlier this month</a> as an alternative to Twitter, which has faced several controversial changes since being acquired by Tesla CEO Elon Musk last year. Earlier this week, Twitter <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/twitter-rebranded-as-x/\">changed its name to \"X\"</a> and said it would become a platform for \"everything,\" including audio, video, messaging, payments, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThreads is integrated with Instagram, resulting in the platform already becoming the largest Twitter alternative, with over 100 million users signed up.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/\">Meta</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/threads/\">Threads</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/threads-rolling-out-following-tab/\">Threads Begins Rolling Out Chronological 'Following' Tab</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/threads-begins-rolling-out-chronological-following-tab.2396858/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4405f38ff2b67063a965a2fead843cd46c4fcbac2836e56a5d25c7313dbae291","category":"Apple"}
