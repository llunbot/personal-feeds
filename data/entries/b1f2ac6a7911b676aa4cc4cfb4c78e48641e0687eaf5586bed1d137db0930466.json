An upper sleeve enables the Koala to slide onto the Exo-Rail mounting system, whose 6mm stainless steel frame reduces sway and bounce. Together, the Koala and Exo-Rail weigh 434g.</p>\n<p>Used alone, the Koala’s size makes it prone to swaying, just like most of its rivals, but the Exo-Rail gives you a feeling of connected stability, which is more comfortable when you’re out of the saddle.

With volumes commonly ranging from 3 to 15 or more litres, saddle bags are a key cornerstone of any bikepacking setup.</p>\n<p>Attaching to your bike via the saddle rails and the seatpost, saddle bags offer an efficient and streamlined way to carry kit on your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/bikepacking/\">bikepacking</a> adventure.</p>\n<p>The biggest seat packs are large enough to comfortably accommodate bulky items such as tents and sleeping bags – crucial for multi-day missions. Smaller saddle bags are perfect for stashing a spare jacket, a hat and some food on all-day epics.</p>\n<p>Providing you have enough clearance between the bottom of your saddle and the rear wheel, you can mount a seat pack to almost any bike, helping to turn it into a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bikepacking-bikes-what-to-look-for-and-how-to-upgrade-your-bike-for-adventure/\">bikepacking bike</a>.</p>\n<p>Commonly seen on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bikes</a>, there are also saddle bags designed for mountain biking. These often have a slightly lower volume (to accommodate for rear suspension movement bringing the rear wheel closer to the saddle) and a specially designed attachment point for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper seatposts</a>.</p>\n<h3>Why do people use saddle bags rather than panniers for bikepacking?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tailfin Alloy Rack with two Ultra-Durable Pannier Bags and AP Trunk Top Bag\" title=\"DSC00533\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Panniers are a great way to securely attach heavy loads, but they come at a cost of weight and compromised off-road performance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle/Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Once upon a time, if you wanted to carry heavy loads you would have likely opted for a rear rack and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-pannier-bags/\">pannier bags</a>, a firm favourite for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-touring-bike-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you/\">touring bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>However, with the progression of bikes and technology enabling riders to venture further off the beaten track, and the advent of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/ultra-distance-cycling/\">ultra-distance races</a>, riders were looking for a lighter, sleeker and more aerodynamic way to carry their essentials.</p>\n<p>Saddle bags tend to be more aerodynamic and lighter in weight than panniers. This can make a big difference when riding long distances, especially off-road on technical terrain.</p>\n<p>Additionally, saddle bags offer a more balanced weight distribution by spreading the load across the bike in a compact and streamlined way. This further improves handling and stability, and enables riders to navigate technical trails without worrying about catching their bags on branches, rocks or shrubs.</p>\n<h3>What size saddle bag do I need for bikepacking?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Restrap 18L Saddle Pack waterproof bag\" title=\"12-06-49BikeRadarJULY_180723ss8506\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> With options ranging from 3 to 18 litres, there’s a saddle bag for everyone.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>What size saddle bag you need depends on several factors. Firstly, it’s important to assess how much clearance you have between your saddle and your rear tyre. Then, you need to decide how much kit you want to carry in your seat pack.</p>\n<p>If you plan on using your bikepacking saddle bag for multi-day camping trips, we would recommend getting as big a seat pack as your bike allows.</p>\n<p>A seat pack is a great place for storing items such as tents and sleeping bags, freeing up storage in your other bags for smaller, more packable items.</p>\n<p>Luckily, many of the best saddle bags use a roll-top design, meaning you can neatly reduce the volume of your bag if you don’t fill it to the maximum.</p>\n<p>If you are mainly interested in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/audax/\">audaxes</a> and day trips, or fancy staying in accommodation overnight, a smaller saddle bag (around 7-10l) is perfect for stashing spare layers, food, pyjamas and any other essentials.</p>\n<h3>What to look for in bikepacking saddle bags</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ortlieb saddle pack for bikepacking\" title=\"Ortlieb saddle pack for bikepacking\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Secure attachment points, durability and ease of access are crucial.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ortlieb</i></span></div>\n<h4>Attachment</h4>\n<p>A secure attachment mechanism is very important. Without a secure fit, the saddle bag will sway as you pedal, which can be unbalancing, especially if the bag is heavily laden.</p>\n<p>Look for heavy-duty webbing to attach the bag to the seat rails and a thick strap to securely attach to your seatpost.</p>\n<h4>Ease of access</h4>\n<p>You don’t want to be spending ages accessing your kit at the end of a day in the saddle or when grabbing a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-waterproof-jackets-for-cyclists/\">rain jacket</a> in a sudden downpour.</p>\n<p>Some seat packs use a holster-style method, where an easily removable dry bag is secured inside a holster. While the holster can take a few minutes to fit and remove, the grab-and-go dry bag can be accessed instantly.</p>\n<p>The roll-top closure of dry bags also means they can be rolled down to securely hold your kit even if they are not fully loaded.</p>\n<h4>Material</h4>\n<p>The best bikepacking saddle bags should last, so durable material is important. Hypalon is a common choice for saddle attachment points, and ripstop nylon or polyurethane make a good choice of outer material.</p>\n<p>Of course, the bag can only be as tough as its weakest link, so make sure the buckles, webbing and straps are also tough enough for your adventure.</p>\n<h4>Waterproofing</h4>\n<p>Nobody likes a soggy sleeping bag, so make sure to take care of the waterproofing finish. Holster and dry bag styles have the added benefit of being easily repairable because the dry bag can be patched or, in the worst case, replaced relatively inexpensively.</p>\n<h3>Other bikepacking bags</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ortlieb bikepacking bike and bags\" title=\"Ortlieb bikepacking bike and bags\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Don’t just stop at the seat pack – with the right kit, you can carry everything you’ll need for a big adventure.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ortlieb</i></span></div>\n<p>There are several types of bikepacking bags, each designed to serve a specific purpose. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frame bags:</strong> Frame bags fill the space inside the bike’s front triangle, and are ideal for carrying heavier items such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-water-bottles/\">water bottles</a>, tools or food.</li>\n<li><strong>Handlebar bags:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-handlebar-bags/\">Handlebar bags</a> attach to the front of the handlebars, and are ideal for carrying bulky items such as a sleeping bag. If you ride a bike with a drop handlebar, your bag choice will be limited by the width of your bar.</li>\n<li><strong>Top tube bags:</strong> Top tube bags are ideal for carrying smaller items that need to be easily accessible, such as a phone, snacks or a map.</li>\n<li><strong>Fork bags:</strong> Fork bags attach to the fork legs of the bike, and are ideal for carrying items such as a stove, fuel, or extra water.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re looking to just carry essentials, such as a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-multi-tool/\">multi-tool</a> or an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\">inner tube</a>, check out our guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-saddle-bags/\">small bike saddle bags</a>.</p>","author":"Finlay Anderson","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"b1f2ac6a7911b676aa4cc4cfb4c78e48641e0687eaf5586bed1d137db0930466","category":"Cycling"}
