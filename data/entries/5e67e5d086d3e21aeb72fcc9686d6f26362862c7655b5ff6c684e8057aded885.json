Through this, my mission is to offer a common denominator for those who would otherwise possibly never cross paths, all by bike.</p>\n<p><em>PAL represents the convergence of lines from different directions, symbolizing the formation of connections and intersections. It transcends the limitations of traditional East-West or North-South orientations, as lines journey from Southeast to Northwest, embracing endless possibilities and curiosity. PAL is not about following a single path; it is about the confluence of diverse perspectives and the creation of communities and bonds. It is where lines meet, and crossing paths with each other.</em></p>\n<p><img width=\"1066\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-5.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-5.jpg?w=1066&amp;quality=75 1066w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-5.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img width=\"1111\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-51.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-51.jpg?w=1111&amp;quality=75 1111w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-51.jpg?resize=768,921&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>This year I decided to change the name from Clyde’s Corner to PAL. but the root of Clyde’s Corner still resides in PAL, like corners; Parallels and Longitudes are the meeting point of all things. Cycling is the medium. Clyde’s Corner was to create a pop-up that operated as a meeting point for those to sell, trade, and barter bikes, bike parts, and gear. I wanted to create a marketplace that brought attention to vintage bikes and encouraged upcycling from the ’80s and ’90s eras of cycling. As this idea evolved and my community expanded, I decided maybe it’s not only bike parts we use to connect people but also filling the void of streetwear or predominantly products that people of color align within the streetwear “industry.” At this point, I was struggling to find products that spoke to me, and my particular appreciation for streetwear and vintage within the cycling industry.</p>\n<p>From that, PAL WAS BORN! I knew through PAL I wanted to cross paths with individuals not only by bicycle but through other mediums such as: music, art, books, zines, movies and TV shows, etc. Essentially in hopes of making a genuine connection and hearing their story while on the bike!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1066\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-41.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-41.jpg?w=1066&amp;quality=75 1066w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-41.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1060\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-42.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-42.jpg?w=1060&amp;quality=75 1060w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-42.jpg?resize=768,966&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>With my background in graphic design, photography, video editing, music, and marketing I have been brainstorming ways to try and connect my creative network outside of cycling for a few years now. I found myself constantly customizing parts on my bikes that fit my personality and style. Our personalities speak through the clothes we wear and there are a lot of us who ride bikes with a sense of bold personal style and not afraid to wear clothes that fit their characters. However, the helmet is one accessory I always found myself settling with depending on what color was available.</p>\n<p>Eventually, it dawned on me to reach out to friends and ask them to customize these helmets for me so I no longer had to settle! Helmets are a necessity and something that should always be worn while riding a bicycle. The helmet can be the connecting point for creatives outside of cycling to meet with those involved with cycling! The medium for artists and the missing garment for those in search of ;) It is the perfect way to fully communicate what PAL aims to be!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1112\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-49.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-49.jpg?w=1112&amp;quality=75 1112w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-49.jpg?resize=768,921&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1066\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-3.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-3.jpg?w=1066&amp;quality=75 1066w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-3.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>I have met a ton of unique individuals on group rides, with one particular person in mind Dan has really held it down over the years and with my involvement, Total Trash has expanded to a massive group ride we do twice a month also extending to Manila, Philippines. Lots of old and some new people coming together to show our latest bike builds and new gear. All crossing paths, and being at the same place at the same time.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"748\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-9.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1066\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-29.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-29.jpg?w=1066&amp;quality=75 1066w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-29.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>Through crossing paths on these rides, SLOWRIDER Mattie was very special; it was like meeting someone with the same mission in mind. I told him about this idea of having an art show and having the helmet as the canvas. I’ve been thinking of a way of bringing my network of creatives into one place that doesn’t have to involve all of us biking.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1066\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-40.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-40.jpg?w=1066&amp;quality=75 1066w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-40.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1066\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-39.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-39.jpg?w=1066&amp;quality=75 1066w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-39.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1066\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-38.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-38.jpg?w=1066&amp;quality=75 1066w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-38.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>I wanted to create an unusual and unique intersection that would include: art, cycling, music, fashion, food, and wine. That’s when I decided to curate a helmet art show with help from Mattie and Jeremy Dunn from Smith. We are aiming to have a PAL x Smith art show on Feb 17th, 2024 called “Crossing Paths” at <a href=\"https://www.neolagallery.com/\">Neo LA Gallery</a>. This art show will be a curation of 22 different artists who will custom handcraft a special Smith Helmet to showcase. With this Art show, we aim to raise funds for each helmet sold donated to No Canyon Hills. In efforts to preserve The Vergudo Mountains.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1998\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-59.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-59.jpg?w=1998&amp;quality=75 1998w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-59.jpg?resize=1200,801&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-59.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-59.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>An Introduction to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/slowridermagazine/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">SLOWRIDER</a> by Matthew Mata-Aguilar</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/slowridermagazine/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">SLOWRIDER</a>, is by no means a remark on “pace,” but a reminder to pay attention to the details.

On a cruise through the city, a friend and I decided to stop by a food pop-up at a weekend market – that’s when Glen and I crossed Paths!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"889\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-14.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-14.jpg?w=889&amp;quality=75 889w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-14.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"889\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-11.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-11.jpg?w=889&amp;quality=75 889w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-11.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"889\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-12.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-12.jpg?w=889&amp;quality=75 889w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-12.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>It was when I met <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mrrotu/\">Glen</a>, at the time Clyde’s Corner, where I really felt the inspiration to push boundaries. We connected through fashion, the arts, and our cultural similarities. I will add, that Glen was carefully harmonizing an orchestra in his head that would later become PAL! I was able to share my 10+ years of industry knowledge with Glen and introduce them to like minded individuals. Not only was my time in LA coming to an end, but also at The Cub House. I am grateful to my family at the Cub House for allowing me to be ME! I was able to work on this concept freely, similar to master car builders honing their craft.</p>\n<p>That is where SLOWRIDER WAS BORN.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1066\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-27.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-27.jpg?w=1066&amp;quality=75 1066w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-27.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1066\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-23.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-23.jpg?w=1066&amp;quality=75 1066w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-23.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>My pops built lowriders and I would spend hours watching him work on every little detail of his ride! You could catch me sitting on a bench at the upholstery shop, riding shotty, or posted up at a show! Those experiences translate through my bike builds.</p>\n<p>SLOWRIDER really came to fruition after the completion of my 97 Schwinn Homegrown. It was not hard to find the inspiration to create “AXOLOTL,” a concept that pays tribute to Chicano culture and the WIP lowrider. Latino heritage is so rich and our culture is so vibrant, mix that with a bike forum geek and ❤️‍🔥. I was fortunate enough to debut the bike at a Lowrider Magazine Supershow and a few weeks later at the annual Bike Show Car Show at The Cub House.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1066\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-37.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-37.jpg?w=1066&amp;quality=75 1066w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-37.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1066\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-36.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-36.jpg?w=1066&amp;quality=75 1066w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/2024_PAL_x_SLOWRIDER-36.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p>Since then I have released a family &amp; friends “Club Tee” and a beautiful handlebar with The Cub House &amp; Doom Bars.
