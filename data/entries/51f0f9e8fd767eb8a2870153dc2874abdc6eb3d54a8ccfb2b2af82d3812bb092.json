The feature allows users to send and receive iMessages and SMS texts, including emoji and Tapbacks, while out of range of cellular and Wi-Fi networks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n<em>CNET</em> met up with Apple's senior director of platform product marketing, Kurt Knight, this week for an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v30z-0bGbHQ\">early first look at how the feature works</a>, while iJustine <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BZMqOATNXE\">offered a similar walkthrough</a> of it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen your phone detects it's out of range of terrestrial networks, you'll get a pop-up alert that offers quick access to all of the available satellite-enabled services including Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a>, and now Messages.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMessages via satellite can also be accessed directly from the Messages app when off the terrestrial grid, with iOS popping up a card to help you point your ‌iPhone‌ toward an available satellite. From there, it works just as a normal Messages conversation does, and you're able to send and receive messages, emoji, and Tapbacks. Conversation messages sent via iMessage are also end-to-end encrypted when sent via satellite.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\niMessages can be sent freely back and forth via satellite, but there are limitations on SMS due to the volume of promotional and automated messages that come through that protocol. Your emergency contacts and specified family members will be able to contact you via SMS at any time, but for all other contacts, you will need to send the first SMS message via satellite, which will then allow them to respond for a period of time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNotably, despite Rich Communication Services (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/\">RCS</a>) support coming in ‌iOS 18‌ later this year, Messages via satellite will not initially work with ‌RCS‌. Knight says the ‌RCS‌ protocol has not yet been optimized to a small enough size to work over a satellite connection, at least as far as Apple is concerned. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs with Apple's other satellite services, Messages via satellite will launch initially only in the United States with ‌iOS 18‌ before later expanding to other countries. Apple's satellite services work on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> and later, and while Apple has indicated it will eventually charge for satellite services, it continues to offer them without charge for the time being.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/satellite/\">Satellite</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/\">Messages</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ios-18-messages-via-satellite-first-look/\">First Look at Messages via Satellite in iOS 18</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-look-at-messages-via-satellite-in-ios-18.2429147/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"51f0f9e8fd767eb8a2870153dc2874abdc6eb3d54a8ccfb2b2af82d3812bb092","category":"Apple"}
