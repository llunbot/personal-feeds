The consortium complained that terrorists, sex traffickers, child abusers, and other criminals will use encrypted messages to evade law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Meta held firm, telling Ars in April that \"we don't think people want us reading their private messages\" and that the plan to make end-to-end encryption the default in Facebook Messenger would be completed before the end of 2023. Meta also plans default end-to-end encryption for Instagram messages but has previously said that may not happen this year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989426#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989426&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c2c90f69e7eacaccb43b5188c28e8b539222952570ceecfb037d50a890d7369d","category":"Tech"}
