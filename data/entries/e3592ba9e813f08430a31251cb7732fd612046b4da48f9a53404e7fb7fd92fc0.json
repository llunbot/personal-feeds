{"title":"New High-End Mac Mini: Everything Rumors Say We Can Expect","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/new-mac-mini-pro-features-expected/","date":1634560572000,"content":"With Apple's \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-18-apple-event-what-to-expect/\">Unleashed</a>\" event just hours away, the focus has understandably been on the new MacBook Pro models that are expected to debut, but rumors suggest we could also see the company unveil a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> with a new design and a faster Apple silicon processor. Here's what we've heard from sources over the past year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/m1x-mac-mini-screen-feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nKicking things off, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman in May said that Apple was working on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/apple-working-on-high-end-mac-mini/\">high-end version of the Mac mini</a>, featuring a more powerful Apple silicon chip than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> and extra ports. Then, in August, Gurman followed up that report by saying that the refreshed ‌‌Mac mini‌‌ would be coming in the \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/22/gurman-high-end-mac-mini-this-fall/\">next several months</a>,\" which lines up well with this month's event. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGurman's specific expectations about the new ‌Mac mini‌ are as follows:\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><strong>The new ‌Mac mini‌ is expected to use the M1X, the same chip as the next-generation MacBook Pro.</strong></li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\nThe next-generation MacBook Pro models are expected to feature an improved version of the ‌‌M1‌‌ chip with a 10-core CPU, containing eight high-performance cores and two energy-efficient cores, and 16-core or 32-core GPU options, meaning this is also what we can expect from the new ‌‌Mac mini‌‌. The processor they share however <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/17/m1-pro-and-m1-max-chip-names-app-log/\">could yet have another name</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><strong>Support for up to 64GB of memory.</strong></li></ul>This is believed to be a benefit of the M1X chip, which is said to support up to 64GB RAM, up from the 16GB maximum RAM supported by the ‌‌M1‌‌.\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><strong>Four Thunderbolt ports will be included at the rear.</strong></li></ul>This would be up from the two Thunderbolt ports that are available on the rear of the current ‌Mac mini‌ with an ‌M1‌ chip, and is also said to be a change supported by the M1X processor.\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><strong>The high-end ‌Mac mini‌ will replace the Intel ‌Mac mini‌ that Apple is still selling.</strong></li><li></li></ul>When Apple introduced the ‌‌M1‌‌ ‌‌Mac mini‌‌ last year, it retained the Intel Mac minis with two additional ports in the product lineup as a high-end option. Apple did the same with the MacBook Pro and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, where the ‌‌M1‌‌ option replaced the entry-level version of the machine, and kept the high-end Intel models with more ports on sale. Gurman expects that the new high-end ‌Mac mini‌ will be sold alongside the current ‌‌M1‌‌ ‌‌Mac mini‌‌. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/mac-mini-back2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nShortly after Gurman's initial report, leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/25/high-end-mac-mini-renders/\">shared renders</a> allegedly giving us a first look at the upcoming ‌Mac mini‌. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Prosser, who has a mixed track record when it comes to Apple rumors, the new high-end ‌‌Mac mini‌‌ will have the following features: <ul><li>A mostly similar design to the existing ‌‌Mac mini‌‌ but a smaller overall size.\r\n<br />\r\n</li><li>The same ports currently available on the Intel-based ‌‌Mac mini‌‌, which includes four Thunderbolt, two USB-A, Ethernet, and HDMI.</li> \r\n<br />\r\n<li>A \"plexiglass-like\" top, which will sit above the aluminum enclosure.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Two possible \"two-tone\" color options, similar to the 24-inch ‌iMac‌.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>The same magnetic power port that debuted in the 24-inch ‌iMac‌.</li></ul><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/mac-mini-ports.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBear in mind that there's no guarantee we'll see a ‌Mac mini‌ announcement at Apple's upcoming \"Unleashed\" event, and <em>Bloomberg</em> originally said Apple could scrap its plans to release this new high-end ‌‌Mac mini‌‌ anytime soon. Regardless, Apple will eventually replace the current Intel models with ones featuring Apple silicon chips. It's just a matter of when.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple will live stream its event later today, Monday, October 18 <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">on its website</a> and on YouTube.
