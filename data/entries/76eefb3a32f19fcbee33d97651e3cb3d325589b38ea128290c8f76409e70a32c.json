We have also\nstrengthened our developer onboarding and review processes,\nrequiring more identity information when developers first\nestablish their Play accounts. Together with investments in our\nreview tooling and processes, we identified bad actors and fraud\nrings more effectively and banned 333K bad accounts from Play for\nviolations like confirmed malware and repeated severe policy\nviolations.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, almost 200K app submissions were rejected or\nremediated to ensure proper use of sensitive permissions such as\nbackground location or SMS access.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>App stores are just greedy monopolies, am I right?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/29/google-security-bad-apps\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"76eefb3a32f19fcbee33d97651e3cb3d325589b38ea128290c8f76409e70a32c","category":"Tech"}
