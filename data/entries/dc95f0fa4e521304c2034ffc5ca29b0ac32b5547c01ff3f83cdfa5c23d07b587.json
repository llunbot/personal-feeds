To kick start proceedings in 2025, the typical opening weekend of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/omloop-het-nieuwsblad-guide\" target=\"_blank\">Omloop Het Nieuwsblad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/kuurne-brussels-kuurne-guide\" target=\"_blank\">Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne</a> will provide the first opportunities for riders to chew into the Classics calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The defending champion of the women’s race Marianne Vos will not be in attendance, neither will the runner-up Lotte Kopecky. Don’t worry though, the top-ranked women’s rider from 2024 Demi Vollering will be here to target her first one-day victory in FDJ-Suez colours. In the men’s race, the 2024 winner Jan Tratnik will be in Ghent to defend his title, albeit on a different team to last year. Along with the Slovenian, Wout van Aert will attempt to pick up a second Omloop title on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oddschecker.com/cycling/omloop-het-nieuwsblad/winner\" target=\"_blank\">According to the bookies’,</a> Van Aert is the favourite for glory this weekend. He has the shortest odds at around 4-1, leading ahead of Belgian Arnaud De Lie, the UAE Team Emirates duo of Jhonathan Narváez, António Morgado and French youngster Paul Magnier. The bookmakers also give Tom Pidcock, Mathias Vacek and Matteo Jorgenson a good shot at victory, all with odds under 20-1.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Favourites for the men’s race</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"wout van aert portugal 2024 vuelta a espana\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/GettyImages-2017672989-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert </a>will be the most marked man in the peloton this weekend. Without the presence of Mathieu van der Poel, Mads Pedersen and Tadej Pogačar on the startline, Van Aert has a great chance to take an early lead in the Classics arms race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Aert has won this race before, riding away to glory in 2022 during his tenure as Belgian national champion. Last year, he added a bronze medal at Omloop to his record, confirming that this race suits his characteristics well. The hills and cobbles will please him, and the likelihood of a sprint at the end should play to the Belgian’s strengths.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the three-time cyclocross world champion had a mixed Volta ao Algarve, Van Aert showed some signs of form on the final day’s mountain time-trial. Visma-Lease a Bike boast a characteristically strong squad to help him too, including Dwaars door Vlaanderen winner Matteo Jorgenson, Tiesj Benoot and Visma returnee Victor Campenaerts. The Dutch outfit have won the three previous editions of the men’s race — all with different riders no less. With this, it’s tough to imagine a final podium without Van Aert.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Biniam Girmay (Intermarché-Wanty)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/biniam-girmay-678b53d64ebe5-970x546.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/biniam-girmay-678b53d64ebe5-970x546.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/biniam-girmay-678b53d64ebe5-300x169.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/biniam-girmay-678b53d64ebe5-768x432.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/biniam-girmay-678b53d64ebe5-750x422.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/biniam-girmay-678b53d64ebe5-1140x641.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/biniam-girmay-678b53d64ebe5.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption>Intermarché-Wanty</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After a phenomenal 2024, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/biniam-girmay-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Biniam Girmay</a> will be returning to the Classics with high expectations. The Eritrean green jersey winner will be hoping to replicate his former glory in the one-day races and claim his first WorldTour Classic since 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Intermarché-Wanty sprinter has been fairly consistent so far in 2025, cracking the top ten in a handful of sprints. He’s often thrived in this early part of the calendar, so expectations will be high this weekend. The mix of cobbles, hills and a potential sprint also benefits Girmay who can be up there in any race scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Girmay will be flanked by Laurens Rex and Adrien Petit, two riders who have enjoyed solid Classics campaigns in recent years. That said, the Eritrean should be fine to fend for himself, armed with a powerful kick if it comes down to a reduced sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Arnaud De Lie (Lotto)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-14.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicknamed ‘The Bull’, Arnaud De Lie has rapidly risen through the ranks to become one of the most decorated riders in the pro peloton. Still just 22 years old, the Belgian has been in contention to win Omloop twice before and it’s hard to imagine him outside of the top ten this weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>De Lie has already opened his victory count for 2025 with a stage victory at the Étoile de Bessèges. He’s been clocking up the kilometres over the past month and has stretched his legs in a couple of sprints in 2025 already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A rugged sprinter capable of getting over hills, De Lie has what it takes to hold onto the wheels up the Kapelmuur and is one of the few riders that could defeat Wout van Aert if they come to the line together. A major Flemish Classic is missing from De Lie’s palmares, but that could soon change if Saturday goes his way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/opt_sprintcyclingagency_0887248_1_originali.jpg 1920w\" /><figcaption>UAE Tour/SprintCyclingAgency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The last time Omloop Het Nieuwsblad was decided by a sprint was in 2021 when Quickstep’s Davide Ballerini took the win ahead of a 45-man group. Although the three most recent editions have been won solo, there’s always a possibility that the victory will come down to a bunch gallop at the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jasper Philipsen will be the fastest sprinter to start Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. The twice runner-up at Paris-Roubaix evidently has a knack for the Classics and, in response, the former green jersey winner will tackle a more one-day-focussed programme in 2025. The bumps on offer on the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad may be too tricky for Philipsen, however, if he holds on, he will be hard to defeat in a bunch sprint. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, recent results may contradict this statement. Philipsen missed the mark at the UAE Tour. He was outgunned by the likes of Jonathan Milan and Tim Merlier with the Belgian poorly positioned throughout the Middle Eastern race. Given how notorious Philipsen has been in the sprints, on the other hand, rival teams may try to up the pace in order to dislodge the Limburg-born fastman.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tom Pidcock (Q36.5)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Vuelta Andalucia</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After his messy breakup with Ineos, Yorkshire’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tom-pidcock\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Pidcock</a> has found a new lease of life since joining Swiss ProTeam Q36.5. After just two months at the squad, Pidcock has already claimed three stage victories, the same figure that he achieved at Ineos Grenadiers over a two-year period. This flying start suggests a strong run of form for the British rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pidcock has had a mixed relationship with Flemish Classics. His first Belgian campaign was his most convincing, adding the 2021 Brabantse Pijl title and a podium finish at Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne to his young palmares. Over the past two seasons, his record has been patchy, however, he’s looking a lot more consistent now that he’s left Ineos Grenadiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pidcock’s killer punch has returned and that could come in handy on the steep bergs of Flanders, particularly the Kapelmuur. A recent win at the Vuelta Andalucia also demonstrates that he’s got his sprinting legs back in shape. If Pidcock were to win the race on Saturday, this will surely guarantee Q36.5 future invites to the Flemish calendar, perhaps inciting Grand Tours to invite the Swiss squad as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jhonathan Narváez (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-2.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption>UAE Team Emirates XRG/SprintCyclingAgency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jhonathan Narváez has had a barnstorming start to life at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates XRG</a>. He won his first stage race of the year at the WorldTour level Tour Down Under. He then flew across the globe and defended his Ecuadorian national title the following week. He hasn’t raced since this jetsetting start to the 2025 calendar, but Narváez has clearly demonstrated a step-up in form since leaving Ineos Grenadiers. His versatility has been polished and he looks capable of a big one-day victory this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Narváez has always been a solid racer in Flanders. He has shone up the short <em>hellingen </em>and has a decent kick that could set him apart from some of the contenders on this list. On a tougher profile at E3 last year, the Ecuadorian finished in a respectable sixth place. He’s never targeted a race like Omloop before, but he’s got a great chance to leave his mark on the race this year to become the first non-European winner in the race’s history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now embedded within the UAE superteam, Narváez could benefit from stronger team support at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. A partnership with Nils Politt and António Morgado could prove lethal, with all three bringing different strengths to the table. In a similar ilk to Visma-Lease a Bike last year, the Emirati squad could throw the kitchen sink at this race and come out victorious.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Oier Lazkano (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-970x646.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-1140x759.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Oier-Lazkano-Red-Bull.jpeg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Red Bull-Bora-Hangrohe/Getty Sport</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/red-bull-bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe</a> are desperately bidding for superteam status. As part of this ambition, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-transfers-2025-winners-and-losers\" target=\"_blank\">the German squad recruited a fleet of upcoming Classics stars,</a> including the Van Dijke twins, Laurence Pithie and this man, Oier Lazkano. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst riding for Movistar last year, the Spaniard stepped up to the plate in the Flemish Classics. Although his former team have historically struggled on these courses, Lazkano came out of the spring with a string of top ten results and a podium place at Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne. His form rippled into the Grand Tours and Lazkano has shown that he is one of the most promising <em>rouleurs </em>in the bunch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The young Spaniard is an aggressive rider, unphased by an attack or two. He can weather the climbs well, so the selection of cobbled <em>bergs </em>and <em>hellingen</em> should be of no major difficulty to Lazkano. He doesn’t have the most ferocious sprint, but he could try a flyer in the final kilometres to seal Spain’s first Omloop Het Nieuwsblad victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>António Morgado (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>UAE Team Emirates XRG/SprintCyclingAgency</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>António Morgado was <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classics-breakout-2024\" target=\"_blank\">a revelation of the 2024 Classics campaign</a>, becoming the youngest rider to reach the top five of the Tour of Flanders since the war period. Having moved up the pecking order within UAE Team Emirates XRG, Morgado now has the faith of his team to chase more Classics success in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A profile like this could suit Morgado well. He’s a strong enough climber to stick with the favourites and he is not afraid to throw an attack off the front of the group. His sprint isn’t too bad either, having finished second in a bunch gallop at the Belgian Classic Le Samyn last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The young Portuguese rider has already taken a one-day victory in 2025 at the Figueira Champions Classic. Morgado was particularly strong there, sealing the victory in an impressive long-range move. He might be underestimated this weekend, but no one should count out the 21-year-old.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Toms Skujiņš (Lidl-Trek)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-15-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-15-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-15-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-15-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-15-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-15-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-15-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-15-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-15-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-15-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Adobe-Express-file-15.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Latvian rider Toms Skujiņš enjoyed his best season to date in 2024. During the year, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a> rider was towards the front of the race, bagging a podium place at Strade Bianche before finishing inside the top ten at E3, the Tour of Flanders and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uci-world-championships\" target=\"_blank\">UCI Road World Championships</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, Skujiņš will be granted more leadership duties within his American team. Mads Pedersen has decided to skip the opening Classics weekend, so the Latvian will immediately step up at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skujiņš is a real wildcard, so expect him to hold on and roll with the punches on this lumpy profile. With the support of 2020 champion Jasper Stuyven and Czech talent Mathias Vacek, the Latvian could be in good stead at the weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jan Tratnik (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/%C2%A9-Flanders-Classics-1-970x646.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption> Flanders Classics </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No winner of Omloop has defended their title since Greg Van Avermaet did the double in 2017. This curse, therefore, now befalls on Jan Tratnik.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Slovenian had a bit of a leg-up last year given that he was riding for the strongest team in the race. He benefitted from the squad’s depth, helping him to escape off the front under the radar. Since that victory, the 2024 Omloop winner has jumped ships to Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe to join his compatriot <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> and to bolster their roster as part of their superteam vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the transfer, Tratnik is on a weaker squad this year. That said, Tratnik has become a well-tuned Classics rider over the past two years. He propelled Tadej Pogačar in the breakaway at the UCI Road World Championships last September and he finished inside the top ten of the Paris 2024 road race. He might not be allowed to spring off the front again, but his status as reigning champion shouldn’t be overlooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other contenders</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-012-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-012-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-012-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-012-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-012-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-012-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-012-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-012-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-012-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-012-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-012-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>James York</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At short odds with the bookies, Paul Magnier is among one of the favourites. The young Frenchman will be making his Omloop Het Nieuwsblad debut this weekend after a strong start to the season in which he claimed a stage win at the Étoile de Bessèges. The Quickstep rider is a hardy sprinter, but his inexperience might be his downfall on a race of this calibre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other young riders to look out for include Czech all-rounder Mathias Vacek who recently wore the yellow jersey in Valenciana and Estonian Classics prodigy Madis Mihkels who signed for EF Education-EasyPost during the winter. His teammate Kasper Asgreen could also feature in the top ten on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the 2025 season got underway, <em>Cyclist </em>predicted that Matej Mohorič will win a cobbled Classic in 2025. Omloop Het Nieuwsblad could offer a chance to make that premonition a reality, however, the sub-200km profile might hinder Mohorič’s chances given he shines on longer days.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-omloop-het-nieuwsblad\">How to watch Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/kuurne-brussels-kuurne-guide\">Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch and start list</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/omloop-het-nieuwsblad-guide\">Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 2025 preview: Routes, favourites, how to watch and start lists</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Favourites for the women’s race</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2199398160-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"GANDIA SPAIN - FEBRUARY 13: Demi Vollering of Netherlands and Team FDJ - SUEZ celebrates at finish line as stage winner during the 9th Setmana Ciclista - Volta Femenina de la Comunitat Valenciana 2025, Stage 1 a 112km stage from Alzira to Gandia on February 13, 2025 in Gandia, Spain.

The Dutchwoman won the opening stage of the Volta de la Comunitat Valenciana, paving the way to the overall title there. On flying form, she defeated her former boss and teammate Anna van der Breggen and Marlen Reusser, both of whom will be rivals later on in the Classics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Volleirng has a decent record in the one-day race. She finished as runner-up in 2022, only missing out in a two-up sprint to that year’s Tour winner Annemiek van Vleuten. In the following years’ editions, Vollering worked for her teammate Lotte Kopecky whilst still finishing within the top 20. Now unshackled by the SD Worx-ProTime chains, Vollering will be the out-and-out leader of FDJ-Suez on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 Tour champion should enjoy the uphills on offer at the Flemish race, with some cobbles to add an extra obstacle. She’s performed well at the Tour of Flanders and Brabantse Pijl in the past, so this kind of profile should be familiar to Vollering. She may launch a long-range move, but she also has a decent kick to her if she has to tow one of her rivals to the line – unless that’s her former teammate Lorena Wiebes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-ProTime)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/lorena-wiebes-uae.jpg 1920w\" /><figcaption>UAE Tour Women</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of Lorena Wiebes, the European champion has started 2025 in winning ways. At the UAE Tour Women earlier in February, Wiebes claimed three stage wins, sweeping up every sprint on offer. She’s already warmed up and is ready to tackle a busy one-day schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong Classics rider in her own right, Wiebes will be able to chase her own fortunes without Kopecky on the startline in Ghent. As a competent gravel rider, she’s proven her prowess on rough surfaces. The hills, however, may be a hurdle for Wiebes to reach the line in front, but she’s capable of hanging on and waiting for a final sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one will want to bring Wiebes to the line, however. Expect Movistar and FDJ-Suez to set a high pace around halfway through the race once the uphills come thick and fast. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Marlen Reusser (Movistar)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/008-Liane-Marlen-1380x920-1.jpg 1380w\" /><figcaption>Movistar Team</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another SD Worx escapee, Marlen Reusser has refound her winning legs at Movistar. After an <em>annus horibilis</em> at SD Worx last year, the Swiss rider has bounced back and already taken her first win of the 2025 season in Mallorca. On top of this, Reusser highlighted her uphill strength with a GC podium in Valenciana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusser, a former winner of Gent-Wevelgem, has been used a teammate before at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. As team leader this year, she will have a chance to show what SD Worx were missing out on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A long-range move could be on the cards. I wouldn’t be surprised of she’s the only one to follow Vollering if they decide to go long. However, Reusser might be cagey in order to avoid a final sprint to the line. The Swiss <em>rouleur</em> will hope for few companions if it comes down to a reduced group in Ninove.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/file-2024-11-06T120406.028.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During her first proper road season in 2024, Puck Pieterse suprised many in the Classics.

The Lidl-Trek leader will be supported by an accomplished roster, including new recruit Emma Norsgaard and Ellen van Dijk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of support riders, Movistar’s Liane Lippert could spring away on the hills. She’ll be on lieutenant duties for Reusser, but the German has the strengths to reach the top ten in a race like Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. Another domestique, Amber Kraak rode a wave of Classics form last year to score a handful of top tens in the cobbled Classics.
