a heck of a lot of money and it doesn’t all go to one person. It’s spread throughout all prize winners over the course of the entire three weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the cash for actually taking the title, there are other classifications to be won than just the general with sprinter’s, climber’s and young rider’s jerseys all getting a slice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even beyond that. there’s money doled out on each stage for the jersey holders and for the top 20 riders on the day. That means theoretically 420 daily prizes over the course of the entire Grand Tour just for stage placings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also important to remember that prize money is usually split among the team rather than just going to the individual rider. It is a team sport after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>GC prize money</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>maglia rosa </em>wearer at the end of every day is awarded a nice €2,000, so even if a rider loses a jersey all is not lost. Money for the overall GC standings comes from the race organisation and also special rewards. We’ve added them together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. €265,668<br />2. €113,412<br />3. €68,801<br />4. €21,516<br />5. €18,154<br />6-7. €13,588<br />8-9. €10,725<br />10. €7,863<br />11-20. €2,863</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sprinter’s jersey prize money</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The points classifications are a little different as the riders who bag the most points on a given day also get some cash. That’s €700, €400 and €200 for the efforts. There’s also €750 for the <em>maglia ciclamino</em> jersey wearer at the end of the day. At the end of the three weeks though, here’s how it shakes up:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. €10,000<br />2. €8,000<br />3. €6,000<br />4. €4,000<br />5. €2,000</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/Jonathan-Milan-in-the-points-jersey-at-the-2024-Giro-dItalia-by-Tim-de-Waele--970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/Jonathan-Milan-in-the-points-jersey-at-the-2024-Giro-dItalia-by-Tim-de-Waele--970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/Jonathan-Milan-in-the-points-jersey-at-the-2024-Giro-dItalia-by-Tim-de-Waele--300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/Jonathan-Milan-in-the-points-jersey-at-the-2024-Giro-dItalia-by-Tim-de-Waele--768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/Jonathan-Milan-in-the-points-jersey-at-the-2024-Giro-dItalia-by-Tim-de-Waele--1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/Jonathan-Milan-in-the-points-jersey-at-the-2024-Giro-dItalia-by-Tim-de-Waele--2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/Jonathan-Milan-in-the-points-jersey-at-the-2024-Giro-dItalia-by-Tim-de-Waele--750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/Jonathan-Milan-in-the-points-jersey-at-the-2024-Giro-dItalia-by-Tim-de-Waele--1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/Jonathan-Milan-in-the-points-jersey-at-the-2024-Giro-dItalia-by-Tim-de-Waele--465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/Jonathan-Milan-in-the-points-jersey-at-the-2024-Giro-dItalia-by-Tim-de-Waele--620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/Jonathan-Milan-in-the-points-jersey-at-the-2024-Giro-dItalia-by-Tim-de-Waele--350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>KOM jersey prize money</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>maglia azzurra, </em>or King of the Mountains, competition is almost identical to the sprints with the daily prizes for jersey wearer and points scorers the same. However the Giro obviously doesn’t value climbers as much (or, rightly, understands the best climbers are the GC men) as the final prize money is half the <em>ciclamino </em>money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. €5,000<br />2. €4,000<br />3. €3,000<br />4. €2,000<br />5. €1,000</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Young rider’s jersey prize money</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously this isn’t a points classification, so the only daily prize for the <em>maglia bianca</em> competition is €750 for the jersey wearer. The money has been doubled since last year. At the end of the Giro, the top five get the same as the sprinters:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. €10,000<br />2. €8,000<br />3. €6,000<br />4. €4,000<br />5. €2,000</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Teams classification prize money</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, overall team performance reaps rewards. The three best teams on the day bag €500, €300 and €100 and the final standings reward:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. €5,000<br />2. €4,000<br />3. €3,000<br />4. €2,000<br />5. €1,000</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage prize money</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned previously the top 20 riders on each stage win cash although there is a steep drop-off. Here’s what each place wins:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. €11,010<br />2. €5,508<br />3. €2,753<br />4. €1,377<br />5. €1,102<br />6-7. €826<br />8-9. €551<br />10-20. €276</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Extra prizes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Giro d’Italia is the working man’s Grand Tour, that’s because it bangs on several other classifications and prizes to reward the less financially equipped teams to get something from the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly there’s an individual intermediate sprint competition, with the top five riders at each individual sprint getting money:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>1. €500</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. €400</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. €300</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4. €200</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5. €100</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And a final intermediate sprint classification also having its own prizes:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. €8,000<br />2. €6,000<br />3. €4,000<br />4. €2,000<br />5. €1,000</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is not all though. We’re still going. There’s a breakaway competition, too, with the rider that had the most kilometres in the break bagging €200 (double last year) each day, and the final classification winner awarded €5,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t forget the combativity award, too.
