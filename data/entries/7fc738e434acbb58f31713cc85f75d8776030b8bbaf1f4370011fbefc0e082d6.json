You can use Buy with AWS to accelerate and streamline your product procurement process on websites outside of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>. This feature provides you the ability to find, try, and buy solutions from Partner websites using your AWS account</p> \n<p>AWS Marketplace is a curated digital store for you to find, buy, deploy, and manage cloud solutions from Partners. Buy with AWS is another step towards AWS Marketplace making it easy for you to find and procure the right Partner solutions, when and where you need them. You can conveniently find and procure solutions in AWS Marketplace, through integrated AWS service consoles, and now on Partner websites.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Accelerate cloud solution discovery and evaluation</strong></span></p> \n<p>You can now discover solutions from Partners available for purchase through AWS Marketplace as you explore solutions on the web beyond AWS.</p> \n<p>Look for products that are “Available in AWS Marketplace” when browsing on Partner sites, then accelerate your evaluation process with fast access to free trials, demo requests, and inquiries for custom pricing.</p> \n<p>For example, I want to evaluate <a href=\"https://www.wiz.io/\">Wiz</a> to see how it can help with my cloud security requirements. While browsing the Wiz website, I come across a <a href=\"https://www.wiz.io/partners/aws\">page where I see “Connect Wiz with Amazon Web Services (AWS)”</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/Wiz-1-2.png\"><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/Wiz-1-2.png\" alt=\"Wiz webpage featuring Buy With AWS\" width=\"1307\" height=\"785\" /></a></p> \n<p>I choose <strong>Try with AWS</strong>. It asks me to sign in to my AWS account if I’m not signed in already. I’m then presented with a Wiz and AWS co-branded page for me to sign up for the free trial.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/Wiz-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/Wiz-2.png\" alt=\"Wiz and AWS co-branded page to sign up for free trial using Buy with AWS through AWS Marketplace\" width=\"904\" height=\"458\" /></a></p> \n<p>The discovery experience that you see will vary depending on type of the Partner website you’re shopping from. Wiz is an example of how Buy with AWS can be implemented by an independent software vendor (ISV). Now, let’s look at an example of an AWS Marketplace Channel Partner, or reseller, who operates a storefront of their own.</p> \n<p>I browse to the <a href=\"https://marketplace-aws.bytes.co.uk/products\">Bytes storefront</a> with product listings from AWS Marketplace. I have the option to filter and search from the curated product listings, which are available in AWS Marketplace, on the Bytes site.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/Bytes-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/Bytes-1.png\" alt=\"Bytes storefront with product listings from AWS Marketplace\" width=\"904\" height=\"634\" /></a></p> \n<p>I choose <strong>View Details</strong> for Fortinet and see an option to <strong>Request Private Offer</strong> from AWS.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/Bytes-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/Bytes-2.png\" alt=\"Bytes storefront with option to Request Private Offer for Fortinet from AWS Marketplace\" width=\"904\" height=\"404\" /></a></p> \n<p>As you can tell, on a Channel Partner site, you can browse curated product listings available in AWS Marketplace, filter products, and request custom pricing directly from their website.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Streamline product procurement on AWS Partner sites</strong></span><br /> I had a seamless experience using Buy with AWS to access a free trial for Wiz and browse through the Bytes storefront to request a private offer.</p> \n<p>Now I want to try <a href=\"https://www.databricks.com/\">Databricks</a> for one of the applications I’m building. I sign up for a <a href=\"http://signup.databricks.com/\">Databricks trial</a> through their website.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/DB-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/DB-1.png\" alt=\"Database homepage after login with option to Upgrade\" width=\"1443\" height=\"500\" /></a></p> \n<p>I chose <strong>Upgrade</strong> and see Databricks is available in AWS Marketplace, which gives me the option to <strong>Buy with AWS</strong>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/DB-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/DB-2.png\" alt=\"Option to upgrade to Databricks premium using Buy with AWS feature of AWS marketplace\" width=\"1426\" height=\"882\" /></a></p> \n<p>I choose <strong>Buy with AWS</strong>, and after I sign in to my AWS account, I land on a Databricks and AWS Marketplace co-branded procurement page.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/DB-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/DB-3.png\" alt=\"Databricks and AWS co-branded page to subscribe using Buy with AWS\" width=\"1433\" height=\"888\" /></a></p> \n<p>I complete the purchase on the co-branded procurement page and continue to set up my Databricks account.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/DB-4.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/DB-4.png\" alt=\"Databricks and AWS co-branded page after subscribing using Buy with AWS\" width=\"1431\" height=\"892\" /></a></p> \n<p>As you can tell, I didn’t have to navigate the challenge of managing procurement processes for multiple vendors. I also didn’t have to speak with a sales representative or onboard a new vendor in my billing system, which would have required multiple approvals and delayed the overall process.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Access centralized billing and benefits through AWS Marketplace</strong></span><br /> Because Buy with AWS purchases are transacted through and managed in AWS Marketplace, you also benefit from the post-purchase experience of AWS Marketplace, including consolidated AWS billing, centralized subscription management, and access to cost optimization tools.</p> \n<p>For example, through the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-billing/\">AWS Billing and Cost Management console</a>, I can centrally manage all my AWS purchases, including Buy with AWS purchases, from one dashboard. I can easily access and process invoices for all of my organization’s AWS purchases. I also need to have valid <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/buyer-iam-users-groups-policies.html\">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions</a> to manage subscriptions and make a purchase through AWS Marketplace.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/billing-1-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/24/billing-1-1.png\" width=\"1453\" height=\"703\" /></a></p> \n<p>AWS Marketplace not only simplifies my billing but also helps in maintaining governance over spending by helping me manage purchasing authority and subscription access for my organization with centralized visibility and controls. I can manage my budget with pricing flexibility, cost transparency, and AWS cost management tools.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Buy with AWS for Partners</strong></span><br /> Buy with AWS enables Partners who sell or resell products in AWS Marketplace to create new solution discovery and buying experiences for customers on their own websites. By adding call to action (CTA) buttons to their websites such as “Buy with AWS”, “Try free with AWS”, “Request private offer”, and “Request demo”, Partners can help accelerate product evaluation and the path-to-purchase for customers.</p> \n<p>By integrating with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/APIReference/welcome.html\">AWS Marketplace APIs</a>, Partners can display products from the AWS Marketplace catalog, allow customers to sort and filter products, and streamline private offers. Partners implementing Buy with AWS can access AWS Marketplace creative and messaging resources for guidance on building their own web experiences. Partners who implement Buy with AWS can access metrics for insights into engagement and conversion performance.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/homepage?pageType=awsmpmp%3Acustomer\">Buy with AWS onboarding guide in the AWS Marketplace Management Portal</a> details how Partners can get started.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Learn more</strong></span><br /> Visit the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/features/buy-with-aws\">Buy with AWS page</a> to learn more and explore Partner sites that offer Buy with AWS.</p> \n<p>To learn more about selling or reselling products using Buy with AWS on your website, visit:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/partners/marketplace/buy-with-aws/\">Buy with AWS seller page</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/homepage?pageType=awsmpmp%3Acustomer\">Buy with AWS onboarding guide in the AWS Marketplace Management Portal</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>– <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kprasadrao/\">Prasad</a></p>","author":"Prasad Rao","siteTitle":"AWS News Blog","siteHash":"6093e072e4117ec22616e844cb857d03ca62c57a411a8affc77cb5e8b6b15bf6","entryHash":"7fc738e434acbb58f31713cc85f75d8776030b8bbaf1f4370011fbefc0e082d6","category":"Tech"}
