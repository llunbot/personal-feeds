But after launching new lightweight carbon XC, all-mountain, and enduro wheels <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dt-swiss-1200-series-revamped-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">last summer</a> with unique new manufacturing tech, DT Swiss decided to make those same new lighter <em>AND</em> stronger carbon MTB rims available separately for custom wheel builds. Pick from new DT Swiss XRC 310, XMC 320 &amp; EXC 330 carbon rims – the same you’d find in their premium 1200-series wheels – and build up some killer new custom mountain bike wheels for yourself…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>DT Swiss separate XRC, XMC &amp; EXC carbon MTB rims</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-individual-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-individual-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro.webp\" alt=\"DT Swiss individual carbon mountain bike rims: XRC cross-country, XMC all-mountain &amp; EXC enduro\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-individual-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-individual-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-individual-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-1536x853.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-individual-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-individual-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-768x427.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/DT Swiss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>DT Swiss builds a lot of great complete system wheels with carbon rims – from road and gravel to XC, all-mountain, and enduro. And DT is one of the few cycling companies that produces their own hubs, spokes, nipples, and both aluminum &amp; carbon rims at all levels. Yet for rims, DT only offered their aluminum rim on their own for custom builds. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-now-sells-separate-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-MTB_custom-wheel-build.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-now-sells-separate-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-MTB_custom-wheel-build.webp\" alt=\"DT Swiss individual carbon mountain bike rims: XRC, XMC &amp; EXC for custom wheel builds\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-now-sells-separate-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-MTB_custom-wheel-build.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-now-sells-separate-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-MTB_custom-wheel-build-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-now-sells-separate-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-MTB_custom-wheel-build-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-now-sells-separate-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-MTB_custom-wheel-build-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-now-sells-separate-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-MTB_custom-wheel-build-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But it seems DT Swiss was finally tired of watching wheelbuilders buy their hubs &amp; spokes to lace them into somebody else’s rims.

Each sells for the same price of $600 / 600€ per rim. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All carbon DT rims feature low-key matte silver water transfer graphics, but also include red, gold &amp; stealth black vinyl decals to match your bike. Carbib rims also come with black DT ProLock Hex aluminum nipples, appropriate width DT tubeless tape, and alloy tubeless valves</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, building up custom carbon mountain bike wheels isn’t cheap and wheels can get smashed. So, beyond guaranteeing the rims to be free from any defects before they get to your wheelbuilder, DT also offers a reasonable Fair Share crash replacement policy for all of their carbon rims. If you damage a carbon rim through real rider error, DT will sell you a replacement rim for $179 / 179€ per wheel to get you back rolling again.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-now-sells-separate-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-MTB_in-front-of-truing-stand.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-now-sells-separate-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-MTB_in-front-of-truing-stand.webp\" alt=\"DT Swiss now sells separate carbon mountain bike rims: XRC cross-country, XMC all-mountain &amp; EXC enduro\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-now-sells-separate-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-MTB_in-front-of-truing-stand.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-now-sells-separate-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-MTB_in-front-of-truing-stand-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-now-sells-separate-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-MTB_in-front-of-truing-stand-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-now-sells-separate-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-MTB_in-front-of-truing-stand-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DT-Swiss-now-sells-separate-carbon-mountain-bike-rims_XRC-cross-country_XMC-all-mountain-and-EXC-enduro-MTB_in-front-of-truing-stand-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All three new carbon rims are available starting today, making their way out through DT’s global distribution chain now to get to a local wheel builder near you very soon.
