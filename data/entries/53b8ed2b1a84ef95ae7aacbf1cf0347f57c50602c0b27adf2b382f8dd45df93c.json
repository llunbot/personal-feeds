Videos that are played pop out of the interface and become more immersive, while emoji characters take over the display and animate in unique ways when shared. Messages can be sent using a virtual keyboard or through dictation via <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs with all ‌visionOS‌ icons on the Home interface, the Telegram icon animates and pops out a bit when it is visually selected, with the animation serving as a visual cue that the app is highlighted. A tap of the fingers launches the app, as the Vision Pro headset uses eye and gesture navigation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to launch the Vision Pro in early 2024, which likely translates to during or before the month of April. We should soon be seeing many other third-party app ‌visionOS‌ experiences as the debut date approaches.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/telegram-demos-visionos-app/\">Telegram Demos visionOS App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/telegram-demos-visionos-app.2410969/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"53b8ed2b1a84ef95ae7aacbf1cf0347f57c50602c0b27adf2b382f8dd45df93c","category":"Apple"}
