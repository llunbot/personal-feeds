In brief, it is geared towards E-Enduro, boasting 170mm of rear wheel travel paired with a 180mm fork. Housed inside the downtube is a 630 Wh battery, powering a Shimano EP801 motor. This boutique-looking machine is a limited edition affair; only 230 units will be produced, with sizing limited (for now) to Medium, Large and XL.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-emtb-andalo-italy-mtb-summer-connection.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-emtb-andalo-italy-mtb-summer-connection-800x534.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-emtb-andalo-italy-mtb-summer-connection-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-emtb-andalo-italy-mtb-summer-connection-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-emtb-andalo-italy-mtb-summer-connection-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-emtb-andalo-italy-mtb-summer-connection-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-emtb-andalo-italy-mtb-summer-connection-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-emtb-andalo-italy-mtb-summer-connection-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-emtb-andalo-italy-mtb-summer-connection.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Credit: Mountain Bike Connection Summer – Mirror Media</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before taking a closer look, I want to point out that Ducati is not designing and manufacturing its own eBikes. It relies on a partnership with THOK, a relatively young eBike brand that was founded in 2017. Stefano Migliorini, the former BMX and Downhill MTB athlete who saw success in the early nineties, is one of two co-founders. The other is Livio Suppo, a man who, in the world of Moto GP at least, needs no introduction. To those not familiar, Livio is widely considered the most successful Moto GP team manager of all time, overseeing some of the success of household names, Casey Stoner and Marc Marquez.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>History aside, let’s take a closer look at the bike itself… we sat down with Giorgio Favaretto at the Summer Bike Connection Event in Andalo, Italy, to learn more about the Ducati Powerstage RR.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-moto-inspired-enduro-emtb-full-carbon-thok-frame.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-moto-inspired-enduro-emtb-full-carbon-thok-frame-800x534.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-moto-inspired-enduro-emtb-full-carbon-thok-frame-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-moto-inspired-enduro-emtb-full-carbon-thok-frame-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-moto-inspired-enduro-emtb-full-carbon-thok-frame-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-moto-inspired-enduro-emtb-full-carbon-thok-frame-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-moto-inspired-enduro-emtb-full-carbon-thok-frame-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-moto-inspired-enduro-emtb-full-carbon-thok-frame-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-moto-inspired-enduro-emtb-full-carbon-thok-frame.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Ducati tells us the Powerstage RR takes inspiration from the Desmosedici GP23 Moto GP Bike.

This much is clear when you take a look at the components it is bedecked with; Ohlins suspension, Pirelli tires, and Braking brakes, brands that all originally made a name for themselves in the world of motorbikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-internal-cable-routing.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\"

What’s more relevant is that the GRAM-RC is available in a size small; the Powerstage RR is limited to M-XL sizes, only, catering to riders from 168 cm to 200 cm tall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the context of Ducati’s other eMTB offerings, the Powerstage RR arrives as the longest travel eBike, intended as a race machine for E-Enduro. It rolls on an MX wheelset (29″ up front, 27.5″ rear), and delivers its 170mm rear wheel travel via a four-bar linkage named the THOK Progressive System-2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-emtb-geometry-1.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"257\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-emtb-geometry-1-800x257.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-emtb-geometry-1-800x257.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-emtb-geometry-1-297x95.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-emtb-geometry-1-120x39.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-emtb-geometry-1-768x247.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-emtb-geometry-1-1536x493.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-emtb-geometry-1.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Click to enlarge. Geometry numbers on the right hand side pertain to the size small, which is not <em>yet</em> available.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the M-XL size range, chainstay length is consistent at 450mm, with reach coming in at 455mm, 475mm and 495mm, respectively. The head angle is 64°, fairly standard for modern enduro bikes, with the seat tube angle of the steeper side of things at an effective 78°. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One number that does seem a little out of place is the BB height, at 361mm. That’s pretty high in the grand scheme, with many eMTBs of this travel bracket coming in much lower than that, around the 345mm mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-oversized-headtube.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-oversized-headtube-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"ducati powerstage rr emtb headtube carbon frame shape\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-oversized-headtube-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-oversized-headtube-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-oversized-headtube-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-oversized-headtube-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-oversized-headtube-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-oversized-headtube-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-oversized-headtube.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Ducati says they paid great attention to stiffness in the head tube, rear triangle and motor areas</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-t-bar-stiffness.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-t-bar-stiffness-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"ducati powerstage rr emtb t-bar frame stiffness carbon layup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-t-bar-stiffness-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-t-bar-stiffness-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-t-bar-stiffness-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-t-bar-stiffness-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-t-bar-stiffness-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-t-bar-stiffness-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ducati-powerstage-rr-carbon-frame-t-bar-stiffness.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Two “T-Ribs” reinforce the motor area</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pricing &amp; Specification</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are only 230 units of the Ducati Powerstage RR, all of which sport the same moto-inspired components seen throughout.
