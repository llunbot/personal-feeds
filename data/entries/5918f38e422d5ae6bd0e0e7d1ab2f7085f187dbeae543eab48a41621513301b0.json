An advocacy group called the Media and Democracy Project (MAD) <a href=\"https://www.mediaanddemocracyproject.org/_files/ugd/f9547d_d59f128ca09d4106b82930d09c12c94f.pdf\">petitioned</a> the FCC to deny the renewal on July 3, arguing that Fox \"has repeatedly aired false information about election fraud, sowing discord in the country and contributing to harmful and dangerous acts on January 6, 2021.\"</p>\n<p>MAD says that Fox lacks the character required to maintain a license and hopes other Fox stations will lose their licenses, too. No other Fox stations are up for license renewal until 2028, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-23/fcc-invites-comment-on-request-to-deny-fox-tv-license-renewal\">Bloomberg article</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962976#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962976&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5918f38e422d5ae6bd0e0e7d1ab2f7085f187dbeae543eab48a41621513301b0","category":"Tech"}
