{"title":"Eurobike Sports Tech Roundup: Cool & Quirky","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/07/eurobike-sports-roundup.html","date":1720293999000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>Above I’ve got a bit of a round-up video of sorts diving into a few different things I found floating around the Eurobike show floor. Some of it’s cool, some of it’s quirky, and some of it might well be vaporware. Also, you get to see me be thoroughly distracted by an assortment of crazy bike contraptions cycling by as I filmed this.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m going to actually break some of these out into separate posts, specifically the Rouvy one, with a dedicated written post on that, since it’s so cool. But till that happens (likely Monday, after I get some Tour de France time-trial tech stuff out), enjoy this quick video on some goodness I found. Likewise, once the other bits end up at the DCR Cave, they’ll get posts as well.</p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qvyYC2zgHM&amp;t=0s\">0:00</a></span><span> Quick Intro<br />\n</span><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qvyYC2zgHM&amp;t=44s\">0:44</a></span><span> Smallest inflator on the market<br />\n</span><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qvyYC2zgHM&amp;t=105s\">1:45</a></span><span> Rouvy GoPro to 3D World Converter<br />\n</span><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qvyYC2zgHM&amp;t=329s\">5:29</a></span><span> Lezyne Saddle AI Alert Light<br />\n</span><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qvyYC2zgHM&amp;t=369s\">6:09</a></span><span> Lezyne Flexi Stem Mount (for action cams/lights/etc…)<br />\n</span><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qvyYC2zgHM&amp;t=448s\">7:28</a></span><span> Some New Thoughts on Trainers/Smartbikes<br />\n</span><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qvyYC2zgHM&amp;t=539s\">8:59</a></span><span> Xpedo Power Meter Pedals<br />\n</span><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qvyYC2zgHM&amp;t=646s\">10:46</a></span><span> WhiizU Virtual Cycling Platform<br />\n</span><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qvyYC2zgHM&amp;t=706s\">11:46</a></span><span> Eurobike Announcements Going Forward?</span></p>\n<p>Also worthwhile, check out some of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@gplama/videos\">Shane Miller’s videos from Eurobike</a>. We spent the first two days together, and then he apparently can’t find his airplane ticket to leave or something, and is still roaming the floor 5 days later (actually not kidding). We chat at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZmzL3HcpOk\">end of his first video</a>, and then he’s got follow-up videos on even more quirky sports tech stuff, including one on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Sbqn5YLPlw\">Power Meters &amp; Random Bike GPS units</a>, and one on…like…<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC781MS_bRQ\">everything else</a>. Legend has it he’s just gonna find a coat closet and stay till next year.</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for watching!</p>\n<p> </p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"31bdc6467a7d69fa6ecc441c6c1935034bcf3e22359de8d4dbb6300dc6190cb1","category":"Cycling"}
