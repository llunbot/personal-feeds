This week, after consulting with a lawyer, the team says it has decided to abandon its Steam distribution plans altogether.</p>\n<p>\"Valve ultimately runs the store and can set any condition they wish for software to appear on it,\" the team <a href=\"https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/07/20/what-happened-to-dolphin-on-steam/\">wrote in a blog post on Thursday</a>. \"In the end, Valve is the one running the Steam storefront, and they have the right to allow or disallow anything they want on said storefront for any reason.\"</p>\n<p>The Dolphin team also takes pains to note that this decision was not the result of an official DMCA notice sent by Nintendo. Instead, Valve reached out to Nintendo to ask about the planned Dolphin release, at which point a Nintendo lawyer cited the DMCA in asking Valve to take down the page.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955649#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955649&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"466b070a4274cc9136fe214879448622e04900564cfd2e5afe806a70704e51b5","category":"Tech"}
