{"title":"Unity Is Buying Weta Digital for $1.6 Billion","link":"https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital","date":1636588408000,"content":"\n<p>Marc Whitten, writing for the Unity blog:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Today, Unity announced that it has entered into a definitive\nagreement to acquire Weta Digital, specifically its artist tools,\ncore pipeline, intellectual property, and award-winning\nengineering talent. The Academy Award-Winning VFX service teams of\nWeta Digital will continue as a standalone entity known as WetaFX\nand will become Unity’s largest customer in the Media and\nEntertainment space. By combining the industry leading VFX tools\nand technical talent from the incredible team at Weta, plus the\ndeep development and real-time knowledge within Unity, we aim to\ndeliver tools to unlock the full potential of the metaverse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is, to me, a <em>wow it’s really happened</em> moment. Even just a few years ago, if you told me Unity and Weta were merging, I’d have assumed Weta was the buyer and Unity the acquisition. But it’s the other way around — and that represents the fact that gaming is now a bigger industry than movies. (As a friend notes, gaming is bigger than movies + sports combined.)</p>\n\n<p>I don’t think this is a big deal for the movie/TV VFX industry. WetaFX continues as it was. But it could be a huge deal for gaming, because Unity now has access to Weta’s apparently excellent toolchain for 3D world building and character creation and animation. Basically, I think Unity wanted to catch up to Unreal in terms of content production tools, and with this acquisition, maybe they do that and more.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/10/unity-weta\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9e8c1fc0b3114abc9a5e19e7e4de51626ab0236ecf69fd438367950e5113f523","category":"Tech"}
