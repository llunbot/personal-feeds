Plenty of individuals inside\nthe company were fans, but we received very little attention from\nApple as a corporate entity. We didn’t much mind being outsiders,\nbut it meant that we often had zero notice of breaking changes\nintroduced by Apple.</p>\n\n<p>During this time, Apple placed an emphasis on improving the\nsecurity of MacOS, continually locking the operating system down\nfurther and further. Though their changes weren’t aimed at the\nlegitimate audio capture we provided our users, they nonetheless\nmade that capture increasingly difficult. We labored to keep our\ntools functioning with each new version of MacOS. Through it all,\nwe lived with a constant fear that Apple would irreparably break\nour apps.</p>\n\n<p>In 2020, the disaster foreshadowed literally one sentence ago\nstruck. Beta versions of MacOS 11 broke ACE, our then-current\naudio capture technology, and the damage looked permanent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kafasis is a friend <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2022/09/30/ep-358\">and</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2022/04/15/ep-343\">frequent</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2019/03/25/ep-247\">guest</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2018/02/09/ep-214\">on</a> The Talk Show (and holds his own as <a href=\"https://justthetip.fm/\">a podcast co-host with a combustible collaborator</a>), and I use quite a few apps in Rogue Amoeba’s suite, so I was familiar with the broad outline of this saga.
