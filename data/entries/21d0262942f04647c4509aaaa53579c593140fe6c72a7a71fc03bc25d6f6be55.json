The upgrades include both motherboards and pre-built laptops that feature new <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/intel-intros-first-meteor-lake-chips-with-faster-gpus-and-worse-single-core-speed/\">Intel Meteor Lake Core Ultra processors</a> with Intel Arc dedicated GPUs; lower prices for the AMD Ryzen 7000 and 13th-gen Intel editions of the laptop; and a new display with a slightly higher 2880x1920 resolution and a 120 Hz refresh rate.</p>\n<p>The Core Ultra boards can come with one of three CPU options: an Ultra 5 125H with four P-cores, eight E-cores, and seven graphics cores; an Ultra 7 155H with six P-cores, eight E-cores, and eight graphics cores; or an Ultra 7 165H with the same number of cores but marginally higher clock speeds. Prices start at $899 for a pre-built or DIY model (before you add RAM, storage, an OS, or a USB-C charger), or <a href=\"https://frame.work/products/mainboard-ultra-1-intel-core?v=FRANJK0002\">$449 for a motherboard</a> that can be used to upgrade an existing system.</p>\n<p>All of the Core Ultra systems and boards ship in August as of this writing. Once this first batch sells out, a second batch will ship in Q3.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027667#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027667&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"21d0262942f04647c4509aaaa53579c593140fe6c72a7a71fc03bc25d6f6be55","category":"Tech"}
