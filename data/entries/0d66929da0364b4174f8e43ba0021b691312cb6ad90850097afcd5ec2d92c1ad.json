The introduction of aerofoil tubing has contributed to Van Rysel claiming a 13.6 watt advantage over the RCR frame at 45kmh, and it has already been used by Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale on flatter races for several months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RCR-F shares very similar geometry and tyre clearance with the RCR to smooth the transition for pros using both bikes in grand tours, but – unlike the RCR – it will only come in one premium grade of carbon, with Van Rysel pitching it as a bike exclusively for racers. To that end, stiffness has increased to the tune of 7% at the head tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices range from €5,499 / £5,000 for a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-105-di2-groupset-review\">Shimano 105 Di2 </a>build through to €9,499 / $11,999 / £10,000 for Dura Ace Di2, with SRAM builds arriving later in 2025. The bike will be available from Decathlon and Sigma Sports in the UK. Claimed weights range from 7.5kg-8.2kg in size medium.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s it for?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03429-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03429-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03429-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03429-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03429-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03429-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03429-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03429-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03429-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03429-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03429-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03429-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Rysel’s aero follow-up to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-round-road-race-bikes\">all-rounder</a> RCR has been something of a breadcrumbed affair. A footnote in the press release about Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale’s December 2024 team launch was the second clue about a bike we first saw camouflaged and leant against the team bus at last year’s Tour de France Grand Départ in Florence. However, now the bike is officially out in the wild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘After simulating 30 iconic races, many times, we decided that basically there are two main race scenarios,’ says Jeremie Debeuf, Van Rysel’s product manager. ‘Once we’d decided on this separation, it was important for us to understand what the main differences impacting performance are. For us, an aero bike was the best solution for flatter race scenarios. The RCR-F has been designed for races featuring less than 1,500m of elevation per 100km, with average speeds of over 40kmh. Everything below Flanders is okay for this bike.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+5\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-5-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Van Rysel RCR-F frameset</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-1-1-scaled-e1743157107457.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-1-1-scaled-e1743157107457.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-1-1-scaled-e1743157107457-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-1-1-scaled-e1743157107457-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-1-1-scaled-e1743157107457-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-1-1-scaled-e1743157107457-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-1-1-scaled-e1743157107457-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-1-1-scaled-e1743157107457-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-1-1-scaled-e1743157107457-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-1-1-scaled-e1743157107457-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-1-1-scaled-e1743157107457-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-1-1-scaled-e1743157107457-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the RCR Pro, which is also available in a slightly cheaper and 40g-heavier carbon layup as just the RCR, the RCR-F will be sold in only one premium configuration, a key indicator of where it’s being positioned in Van Rysel’s lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The RCR range is for the global market – for Granfondo riders as well as pros – whereas the RCR-F is just for racers,’ says Debeuf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the French brand was bullish in the RCR’s focus on speed above all else, this has been amplified yet further in the design of the RCR-F.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This is a demanding bike which is undoubtedly for powerful racers who want to ride at high speed.

alterations to the RCR-F’s carbon layup, which was formulated based on feedback from AG2R riders. Two types of carbon fibre have been used: 40T and 60T. The latter is particularly stiff and has been used sparingly in certain locations to increase rigidity. While Debeuf was happy to incorporate additional stiffness, he didn’t want to take it too far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We spoke to sprinters, <em>puncheurs</em> and classics riders – Sam Bennett, Paul Lapeira and Oliver Naesen to name a few – who said that the RCR Pro was a bit too soft, so we’ve stiffened the bottom bracket area and made the head tube 7% stiffer,’ says Debeuf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘But we had to take into account both the theoretical lab testing and the real-world field testing. Every time you reduce speed to corner and then accelerate again, excessive stiffness made the frame less efficient than when it was sprinting,’ says Debeuf.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Van Rysel RCR-F geometry</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-6-970x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-6-970x970.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-6-300x300.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-6-150x150.webp 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-6-768x768.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-6-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-6-2048x2048.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-6-75x75.webp 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-6-350x350.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-6-750x750.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-6-1140x1140.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>According to Debeuf, the RCR-F and the RCR-Pro share very similar geometry in order to smooth the transition for AG2R riders swapping between bikes during a Grand Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The RCR-F comes with five spacers, which is one more than the RCR Pro. We wanted to keep the same position between the two bikes. However, the aero frame and fork increase the surface area, meaning there are some slight changes to geometry to keep the rider’s position consistent.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means a continuation of the aggressive angles of the RCR Pro, while work has been done to make the integrated cockpit both more aerodynamic and more ergonomic, with Van Rysel claiming a saving of 2.7 watts at 45kmh. Continuing its partnership with bar specialist Deda, Van Rysel has developed Ergodrops, a specially shaped insert for the 12° flared drops, which are said to improve a rider’s grip in sprints by increasing the contact area.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Lifestyle-11-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Lifestyle-11-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Lifestyle-11-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Lifestyle-11-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Lifestyle-11-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Lifestyle-11-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Lifestyle-11-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Lifestyle-11-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Lifestyle-11-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Lifestyle-11-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Lifestyle-11-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Lifestyle-11-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The two bikes do have starkly different profiles, however, with the RCR-F looking like a flattened version of its sibling. Aerofoil tubing is present throughout, as well as a deeper head tube, seat tube and forks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined, Van Rysel claims the RCR-F has a 13.6 watt advantage over the RCR Pro at 45kmh, which rises to 20.1 watts at 55kmh. When tested on a 268km classics route with 2,250m of elevation at the standardised power, Van Rysel says the RCR-F saved 90 seconds on the RCR Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Working with the same partners as before, Swiss Side and Onera [French Aerospace Lab], we made something like ten different 3D printed iterations and tested them in the wind tunnel to define the best line for the fork, frame and cockpit,’ says Debeuf. ‘We tested it against five bikes – the serious competitors – and we are confident that the RCR-F is the fastest.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Van Rysel RCR-F weight and tyre clearance</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-4-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-4-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-4-300x300.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-4-970x970.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-4-150x150.webp 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-4-768x768.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-4-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-4-2048x2048.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-4-75x75.webp 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-4-350x350.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-4-750x750.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/RCR-F-Cutout-4-1140x1140.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As you’d expect, Van Rysel was less concerned about weight this time around but set an upper boundary to operate beneath.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We set a limit of 7.5kg in size medium so that on hills up to around 7% the sprinters won’t have to put in too much extra effort and will still be able to finish strongly,’ he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the emphasis on stiffness, Van Rysel’ translates as ‘from Lille’’s roots are in Roubaix and Flanders, so there is of course still a focus on insulating riders from the worst of the cobbled surfaces they will face in 2025. The RCR-F matches the 33mm clearance of the RCR, but Van Rysel currently specs the bike with a 25/28mm front/rear tyre combination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘With a 25mm front tyre it’s not very comfortable,’ admits Debreuf. ‘For Roubaix the pros will ride with 32mm tyres unless it’s very dry, in which case it will be 30mm.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Hell of the North just around the corner, it won’t be long
