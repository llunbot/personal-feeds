Their new Ultimate Sealant is said to be, well, the ultimate. They’re so confident in the sealing abilities of the Ultimate Sealants that Silca has amended the contracts of their sponsored riders taking part in the Life Time Grand Prix. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calling it ‘The Bad Day Bonus’, Silca plans to shell out $500 for any sponsored racer that gets a puncture that doesn’t seal while racing a Life Time Grand Prix Event. To our knowledge, that’s a first for a sealant company to offer to pay their racers if they manage to get a flat that doesn’t seal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s great for the racers, but what about you? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same formula updates that allow Silca to offer their Bad Day Bonus should also work out in your favor by delivering a sealant that will help you go the distance even when you’re not racing. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Silca-Ultimate-tire-sealant2-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"997\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Silca-Ultimate-tire-sealant2-1536x997.webp\" alt=\"Silca Ultimate tire sealant comparison new vs old\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Silca-Ultimate-tire-sealant2-1536x997.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Silca-Ultimate-tire-sealant2-297x193.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Silca-Ultimate-tire-sealant2-120x78.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Silca-Ultimate-tire-sealant2-768x499.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Silca-Ultimate-tire-sealant2-2048x1329.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To get there, Silca claims this is “the first sealant to blend both natural and synthetic latex in a tubeless tire sealant.” The sealant also gets an improvement on their FiberFoam technology with single strand carbon fibers for an occluding agent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to better control of the carbon strand length, and the sealant blend, those carbon strands are said to be better dispersed throughout the sealant – meaning you won’t get a bunch of clumps that make it difficult to use a sealant injector. While the original FiberFoam sealant had to be poured into the tire, this new formula can be injected. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another benefit to the new formula is that the combination of synthetic and natural latex eliminates the need for using a separate replenisher product to keep the sealant liquid. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Silca-Ultimate-tire-sealant3.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1164\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Silca-Ultimate-tire-sealant3.webp\" alt=\"Silca Ultimate tire sealant\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Silca-Ultimate-tire-sealant3.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Silca-Ultimate-tire-sealant3-297x288.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Silca-Ultimate-tire-sealant3-120x116.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Silca-Ultimate-tire-sealant3-768x745.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Seals 6+mm punctures</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Injectable through the valve</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lasts 6+ months, even in desert climates</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Proprietary Natural and Synthetic Latex blend</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Optimized carbon fiber strand length</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Advanced Foaming agents to carry carbon strands to a puncture Ammonia Free</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ultimate Sealant is available at select bike shops worldwide with pricing set at $42.00 for 1L, $24.00 for 500ml (about 16.91 oz), and 6 for 65ml (about 2.2 oz).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://silca.cc/products/ultimate-tubeless-sealant\" target=\"_blank\">silca.cc</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-plans-to-pay-sponsored-racers-bonus-if-they-flat-with-new-ultimate-sealant/\">Silca Plans to Pay Sponsored Racers Bonus If They Flat with New Ultimate Sealant</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"db99e828324bbaccf9282d7f9d93b70be7341ce80f2173670cccd1533b10b1f8","category":"Cycling"}
