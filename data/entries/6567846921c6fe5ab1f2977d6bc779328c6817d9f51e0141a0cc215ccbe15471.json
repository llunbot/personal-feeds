Today we are launching a funding initiative with the goal of raising $300,000, in order to further develop our program to help underserved youth (ages 8-18) develop entrepreneurial and leadership skills that they can use for the rest of their lives.</p>\n<p>Our focus is on working with youth from communities where exposure and access to the sport of cycling is typically very limited, specifically in South LA communities Our program continuously educates kids and youth on the emotional, physical, societal, and environmental benefits of the cycling lifestyle. We want to get more youth on bikes! We want to continue to drive more inclusion, equity and opportunity for underserved youth within our community, and provide more resources for youth beyond our existing race team – and we need help to make this happen.</p>\n<p>What are we asking for? The goal is to raise $300,000 by February 16, 2022. One hundred percent of the funds will go towards:<br />\n– Launching our very own Community Bike Shop – Provide bicycle servicing, help sustain our organization, serve as a centralized location to connect more youth to the sport of cycling, and to raise cycling awareness for the community at-large.<br />\n– Launching Earn-A-Bike – This is a fun, experiential earn and learn program that introduces youth ages 8-18 to bicycle safety education, bicycle mechanics and maintenance, as well as life lessons!<br />\n– Bicycle Career Education and Programming – This program will focus on career exploration in the bicycle industry and beyond, job readiness development, and bicycle retail training.<br />\n– Expanding our Race Team – Develop and support a women’s cycling team in 2022!</p>\n<p>If you’d like to help us change the lives of underrepresented youth in cycling, please donate here: <a href=\"https://labikeacademy.org/\">www.labikeacademy.org</a> or contact us at labikeacademy@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Follow us on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/labikeacademy/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/labikeacademy/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2021/12/los-angeles-bicycle-academy-launches-an-initiative-to-expand-its-youth-outreach-work/\">Los Angeles Bicycle Academy Launches an Initiative to Expand its Youth Outreach Work</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Josh Weinberg","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"6567846921c6fe5ab1f2977d6bc779328c6817d9f51e0141a0cc215ccbe15471","category":"Cycling"}
