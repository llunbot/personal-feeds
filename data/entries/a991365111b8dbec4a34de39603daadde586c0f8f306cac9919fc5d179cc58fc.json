As a result, both cases, <em>Twitter v. Taamneh</em> and <em>Gonzalez v. Google</em>, have been remanded to a lower court, and at least for now, the Section 230 immunity shield remains fully intact.</p>\n<p>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Twitter-v-Taamneh-Opinion-5-18-2023.pdf\">opinion</a> in the Twitter case. He concluded that allegations that Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube knew for years that \"ISIS was using their platforms but failed to stop it from doing so\" were \"insufficient\"—even without considering Section 230 protections—to establish that the social platforms aided and abetted a specific 2017 terrorist attack on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey. That attack, carried out for ISIS by Abdulkadir Masharipov, killed 39 victims and injured another 69.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940290#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940290&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a991365111b8dbec4a34de39603daadde586c0f8f306cac9919fc5d179cc58fc","category":"Tech"}
