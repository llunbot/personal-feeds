Now, though, those Tesla games can apparently be played even when the car is moving, a feature that could run afoul of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration guidelines and state laws designed to combat distracted driving.</p>\n<p>While the ability to play Tesla games outside of Park is being highlighted in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/business/tesla-video-game-driving.html\">New York Times report</a> today, the change was seemingly rolled out months ago. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkeFAiRxtM8\">YouTube video from January</a> shows <em>Solitaire</em> being played on a Tesla screen while the car is shifted into Autopilot mode, for instance (though other games appear not to work with Autopilot in the same video).</p>\n<p>In another video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZZjF6ZUKCc\">posted in July</a>, a Tesla owner shows space shoot-em-up <em>Sky Force Reloaded</em> being played while the car is shifted into drive. That video says the new capability was added as <a href=\"https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/version/2021.12.25.6/release-notes\">an unannounced feature of July's 2021.12.25.6 firmware update</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818561#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818561&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8ba7310aae940aa134ef3192ef6f14888363d3c385173650b87c22d6e4ea9e78","category":"Tech"}
