{"title":"DJI Mini 4 Pro Active Track Review (Sports Focus)","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/09/dji-mini-4-pro-review-of-active-track-cycling.html","date":1695753908000,"content":"<p></p>\n<p>It’s not that I set out to cause misery for drones, rather, I view it more as a service that you’ll be able to use to determine which environments you can take your drone while doing whatever sports activity that you want to film – all autonomously (meaning, it’ll follow you automatically).</p>\n<p>With the new DJI Mini 4 Pro, it’s got full 360* “omnidirectional” obstacle avoidance sensors, just like DJI’s higher-end drones. It’s the first time we’ve seen that, at this price point from DJI. Additionally, it also a new ‘Active Track 360’ feature, that lets you create more dynamic ActiveTrack movements mid-ride (or mid-run, or mid-kayak, etc…).</p>\n<p>Of course, as always, I’m here to see how well these things hold up in real-life. And no better way to do that than test it against what has become The Gauntlet for testing the autonomous tracking capabilities of drones.</p>\n<p>To see how well this drone holds up (and in this case, many times over), hit the play button up above. This little guy doesn’t give up easily.</p>\n<p>Thanks for watching!</p><div>\n<h3>Found This Post Useful?
