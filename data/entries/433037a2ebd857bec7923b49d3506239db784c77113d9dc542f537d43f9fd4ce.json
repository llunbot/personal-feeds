{"title":"The Porsche Taycan 4S: Better than a 911?

Since then, withdrawal has set in. I've been desperate for another fix of this EV that still feels like the happy result of a transporter accident involving a Porsche 928 and an iPhone. My initial impressions were formed driving through Denmark and northern Germany, and I wanted to know if those held up on domestic roads and surrounded by our domestic EV infrastructure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/the-103800-porsche-taycan-4s-electric-car-will-arrive-in-spring-2020/\">The introduction of the more affordable Taycan 4S</a> seemed like a good reason to revisit the car, but Porsche wanted us to stretch the car's legs on a proper road trip. There was one trip in particular that I had in mind: DC to Watkins Glen, NY, a trek to coincide with the annual six hour IMSA race. The pandemic dashed any hopes of attempting that trip in 2020, but this year the stars aligned, and so it is I recently spent a week with the sleek white four-door electric sports car you see above.</p>\n<p>For a detailed technical look at the Taycan, please refer to our previous coverage <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-porsches-new-electric-car/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/the-porsche-taycan-every-bit-as-good-as-a-200000-porsche-should-be/\">here</a>. Briefly, the 4S has a pair of electric motors (one for each axle) that output a combined 360 kW (482 hp) and 650 Nm (479 lb-ft) (or 420 kW/562 hp when using launch control), fed by a 93.4 kWh (83.7 kWh useable) battery. Our test car was equipped with the larger Performance Battery Plus option, which bumps the starting price from $103,800 to $109,370 before tax credits.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784984#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784984&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
