But it’s been impossible for anybody to see more than\nglimpses of it. It’s too vast. Every battle, every bombing, every\nmissile strike, every house burned down, has left its mark across\nmultiple front lines, back and forth over more than two years.</p>\n\n<p>This is the first comprehensive picture of where the Ukraine war\nhas been fought and the totality of the destruction. Using\ndetailed analysis of years of satellite data, we developed a\nrecord of each town, each street, each building that has been\nblown apart.</p>\n\n<p>The scale is hard to comprehend. More buildings have been\ndestroyed in Ukraine than if every building in Manhattan were to\nbe leveled four times over. Parts of Ukraine hundreds of miles\napart look like Dresden or London after World War II, or Gaza\nafter half a year of bombardment.</p>\n\n<p>To produce these estimates, The New York Times worked with two\nleading remote sensing scientists, Corey Scher of the City\nUniversity of New York Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of\nOregon State University, to analyze data from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/world/europe/ukraine-destruction.html?smid=threads-nytimes#g-methodology\">radar\nsatellites</a> that can detect small changes in the built\nenvironment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A staggering, sobering work of journalism and data visualization.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/06/nyt-ukraine-\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e7c696452161883cb2adf94f0ea38af89c61443f4d4df75ec46c7fda525438a1","category":"Tech"}
