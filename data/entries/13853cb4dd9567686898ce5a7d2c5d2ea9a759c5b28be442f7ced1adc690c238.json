A revolutionary approach…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies carried out by SiS upturned accepted wisdom that athletes could only tolerate 90g of carbs per hour, instead revealing that not only was 120g possible but that this increase delivered a sizeable boost in performance. At the heart of Beta Fuel is a combination of maltodextrin and fructose, which use different transporters to carry glucose from the gut to the bloodstream. Combining the two at a ratio of 1:0.8 allows for greater carbohydrate delivery to muscles during exercise, therefore increasing how much carbohydrate is available to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready for some stats? This ratio has been proven to enhance total exogenous carbohydrate oxidation by 17%, boost average power output during 10 maximal sprint efforts by 3% and increase the percentage of ingested carbohydrate oxidised from 62% (in a 2:1 ratio) to 74%. So how do you achieve 120g of carbs per hour? Simply by mixing and matching from the four Beta Fuel products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fuelling Tour de France wins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a no-brainer that the world’s leading sports nutrition brand should partner with the dominant team in 21st century pro cycling – Ineos Grenadiers. Their partnership has been a gamechanger. Chris Froome’s epic 80km solo ride on Stage 19 of the 2018 Giro d’Italia? Powered by Beta Fuel. Geraint Thomas’s heroic Tour de France victory in the same year? You guessed it… Beta Fuel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ineos stalwart Luke Rowe sums up the benefit: ‘Nutrition has evolved massively in recent years, and the biggest change is the knowledge behind what the individual athlete needs. The quality of SiS products is clear to see, plus they taste better.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Tour de France, riders and teams scrutinise every millisecond, milligram and millilitre over 21 gruelling days of racing. Which is why Science in Sport’s own professionally accredited high-performance nutritionist</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Marc Fell, is embedded with the team, with the job of making sure its riders are fuelled optimally throughout the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Energy, bottled</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The key product used by both pros and everyday endurance riders is <a href=\"https:/www.scienceinsport.com/beta-fuel-80?utm_source=Referral&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=Cyclist_TdF_Advertorial__;!!MOA0!ckKMa0VJrUMvigR1kxKnj38Hlgq8OpKDb1MVayXb7dQPByLQztbso_5qvgeiH5Fj9lfy_RlORcM7FXbMuKMNcmN8w05Tch9v54Y_$\" target=\"_blank\">SiS Beta Fuel 80</a>, an isotonic drinks powder that delivers 80g of carbohydrate when mixed with 600ml of water.

Aim to eat between one and three bars – which can be broken down into individual chews – per hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Instant hit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before SiS Beta Fuel, the only isotonic energy gels on the market contained around 20g of carbs.

Each 60ml gel contains 1g of L-taurine, 250mg of Cognizin to enhance information processing, 200mg of caffeine and 200mg of L-theanine, which has been shown to increase subjective feelings of alertness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I try to use it going into the last hour of racing,’ says Geraint Thomas. ‘It’s good to have a pick-me-up for when the final really kicks off.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Safety first</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a reason SiS products are trusted by athletes at the top of their game.
