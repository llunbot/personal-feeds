Seven months after it was initially decided that the 25-year-old had raced on the bike path and was therefore disqualified under UCI regulation 2.2.025, the Danish Cycling Union (DCU) reversed the verdict and declared Price-Pejtersen the winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Price-Pejtersen recorded a time two seconds faster than Mattias Skjelmose last June to initially be declared the winner, only to be disqualified after footage emerged of him taking to a bike path. At the time, Skjelmose took to Instagram, saying, ‘I would like to express my great sympathy for Johan, who is not only a fantastic time-triallist as we saw yesterday, but whom I consider a good friend in the peloton. I have therefore offered Johan that he can have both the Danish Championship jersey and medals that I was presented with to recognise his achievement, so that it does not go down in history as a pure annoyance.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the decision to reverse the disqualification, Price-Pejtersen told Danish television that he was ‘deeply critical’ of DCU’s handling of the situation, saying there had been ‘a great reluctance to get to the bottom of this matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I agree that one can make a mistake, but the subsequent handling of the case and the attitude from the DCU have been really hard for me to deal with. I don’t feel that they have wanted the best for the case… I haven’t felt that the DCU’s integrity has matched the attitudes towards how I think sport should be and it has been hard to witness.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tao Geoghegan Hart speaks out</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/tao-geoghegan-hart-2024-647x970.jpeg\" alt=\"Tao Geoghegan Hart posing in Lidl-Trek kit\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/tao-geoghegan-hart-2024-647x970.jpeg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/tao-geoghegan-hart-2024-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/tao-geoghegan-hart-2024-768x1151.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/tao-geoghegan-hart-2024-1025x1536.jpeg 1025w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/tao-geoghegan-hart-2024-750x1124.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/tao-geoghegan-hart-2024-1140x1709.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/tao-geoghegan-hart-2024.jpeg 1366w\" /><figcaption>Sean Hardy via Lidl-Trek</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>British rider <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tao-geoghegan-hart\" target=\"_blank\">Tao Geoghegan Hart</a> took to Instagram to comment on the cost of watching cycling in the UK after the news that Eurosport will close and all of its cycling coverage would be <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/eurosport-tnt-sports-premium\" target=\"_blank\">moving to TNT Sports</a> to be combined in a package with other sports, effectively increasing the monthly cost from £6.99 to £30.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘For those in need of some context, the cost of watching racing has gone from £87 a year to £370,’ the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a> rider wrote. ‘As of yet, I’ve seen little comment from pro cycling itself, especially from the many GB [Great Britain] riders whose profiles, families &amp; fans it impacts so greatly,’ he said.<br /><br />‘Let’s be clear, the sport going behind such a large paywall is a huge problem. Professional sports are all competing for the same audience. Cycling is completely reliant on this audience, it is how teams justify themselves to sponsors spending millions a year. Only a few teams can realistically promise a sponsor to win the Tour, but all teams can demonstrate good ROI when capturing so many eyes, hearts and minds. It’s not only wins that can be of value. It’s the journey and the heartache too.<br /><br />‘I find it hard to believe many fans will be able to justify this increase in costs to follow our races and those of our female colleagues. This is a huge shame. Cycling provides such great entertainment and inspiration to so many. GB fans are living a real high point of the sport. There are so many GB professionals, with Tom Pidcock winning his first race for his new team this afternoon a great example of that.<br /><br />‘To be clear on something that many don’t understand, teams receive zero remuneration from TV rights. What do I want to say? For amateur riders, cycling has become a very expensive sport or passion. Now as a GB fan, following the upper echelons of the sport has also suddenly and massively increased in cost. I think it is now very relevant to realise where this money is going and where it is not. And perhaps to question the monopoly held over the sports UK coverage.<br /><br />‘I welcome all opinions on this and am curious to hear how many people have cancelled their subscriptions. This season I’ll try to champion more accessible media. I’ll remain incredibly grateful to our sponsors. I’ll also be very interested to hear from you all which platforms myself and Lidl-Trek should consider collaborating with. We want and need to remain available to all of the huge GB audience that has been built up over the last 15 years of astronomic success.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aidan Worden dies aged 18</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>All of us here at British Cycling are devastated to learn of the tragic loss of Aidan Worden.<br /><br />A promising young talent and incredibly valued friend and teammate, there is no doubt this loss will be felt deeply by the whole cycling community.<br /><br />Our thoughts are with his family and… <a href=\"https://t.co/SCDnUqkxUm\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/SCDnUqkxUm</a></p>— British Cycling (@BritishCycling) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BritishCycling/status/1886374477363028161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">February 3, 2025</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>18-year-old British cyclist Aidan Worden has died following a collision with a car driver while out on a training ride in Lancashire. Worden, who became the junior 25-mile time trial national champion last year, rode professionally for 360Cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement on Facebook, the team wrote, ‘It is with the deepest sadness that today we lost one of our young riders. At around 10:30 this morning, while on a training ride with his mates, Aidan had an accident which resulted in him losing his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Aidan has been part of 360 for over 3 years, during that time he has developed as a person, man and rider to a level few of us ever achieve. He never judged anyone and always supported others, especially when it came to fixing our bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘2024 saw some amazing rides from the boy that set out a clear example of what a young person can achieve with the right determination. He is the Current national 25TT Junior Champion and also enjoyed very much being 1st Junior in last year’s Eddie Soens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As his coach and as team-mates for the last 3 years, watching him grow, train and mentor others, we are absolutely heartbroken. Our thoughts are very much with his beloved family that he leaves behind. RIP Aidan you will be very much missed and always in our hearts!’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An investigation has been launched by Lancashire Police.
