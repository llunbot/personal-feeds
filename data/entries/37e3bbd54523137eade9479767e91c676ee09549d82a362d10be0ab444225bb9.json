However, the new Bartender owner is a largely unknown entity that has reportedly <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1d7zjv8/comment/l7440wb/\">hiked</a> Bartender's purchase options, and is alleged to have added code to the app that may be associated with collecting analytics data on users. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven that Bartender requires extensive permissions to operate in macOS, including screen recording, the whole event has understandably left many users <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@wsig/post/C72hn8qOPTH\">concerned about privacy</a>. Fortunately, Bartender is not the only app of its kind. So unless Apple ever gets round to integrating better menu bar management into macOS, here are some alternative menu bar utilities that are worth considering. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/\">Vanilla</a></strong> (Free) – Simple app that lets you hide menu bar icons.
