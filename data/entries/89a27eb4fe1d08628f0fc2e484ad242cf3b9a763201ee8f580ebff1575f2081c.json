Parc’s The Bag is designed to fix such situations by organizing all the bits and pieces into a single bag that also displays them so they’re easy to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-1.jpg\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"2048\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-1.jpg\" alt=\"parc the bag cycling tool and kit organization travel backpack hanging on a car seat headrest\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-1.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-1-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-1-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-1-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-1-1536x1536.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bag works as a backpack, a duffel, or a wall-mounted storage pack, and even has a very clever headrest “hood” that lets you hang it off your car seat for parking lot prep. Or loop it over a rear seat’s grab handle to have it hanging right by your door.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-tool-organization.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"742\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-tool-organization.webp\" alt=\"parc the bag cycling tool and kit organization travel backpack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-tool-organization.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-tool-organization-297x184.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-tool-organization-800x495.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-tool-organization-120x74.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-tool-organization-768x475.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the 32L bag are 20+ pockets, loops, and other features to keep things organized. Clear vinyl pouches make it easy to see everything at glance, and two larger concealed pockets hold shoes and a helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-3.jpg\" alt=\"parc the bag cycling tool and kit organization travel backpack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-3.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-3-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-3-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-3-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-3-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-3-1536x1536.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The clamshell design folds open and flat, so it can hang wide open to display everything everywhere all at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-2.jpg\" alt=\"parc the bag cycling tool and kit organization travel backpack being worn and carried\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-2.jpg 1620w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-2-297x147.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-2-800x395.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-2-120x59.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-2-768x379.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parc-the-bag-cycling-backpack-organization-travel-bag-2-1536x759.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Close it up with the YKK zippers and it’s a highly water-resistant backpack with a grab handle on the top. Stealth reflective strips run diagonally across the back, and there’s a blinky light loop, too. MSRP is $179.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://rideparc.com\" target=\"_blank\">RideParc.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/parc-the-bag-bike-tool-kit-organizer/\">Parc’s The Bag Organizes Your Kit Better, Hangs Out Anywhere</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"89a27eb4fe1d08628f0fc2e484ad242cf3b9a763201ee8f580ebff1575f2081c","category":"Cycling"}
