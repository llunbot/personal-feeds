He has repeatedly said the new MacBook Air models are already in production, so a release as early as January or February rather than March or April seems possible.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBelow, we recap rumors about the next MacBook Air models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new MacBook Air models are expected to be equipped with Apple's already-released M4 chip, which has a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple already updated the MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini with M4 chips in late October. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/m4-mac-chip-benchmarks/\">Geekbench 6 results</a> showed that the M4 chip is up to 25% faster than the M3 chip in terms of multi-core CPU performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/macbook-air-now-starts-with-16gb-ram/\">increased the minimum RAM</a> included in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing in the footsteps of the MacBook Pro, the next MacBook Air models will likely have an upgraded 12-megapixel camera with support for Center Stage, a feature that automatically keeps you centered on video as you move around. The camera should also support Desk View, which shows both you and an overhead view of your desk.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCenter Stage is available in video calling apps like FaceTime and Zoom. The feature was previously limited to newer iPad models and Macs connected to Apple's external Studio Display. The new MacBook Pro and iMac models were the first Macs to support Center Stage without needing to rely on a Studio Display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new MacBook Air models will likely be equipped with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, whereas the current models have two Thunderbolt 3 ports. And the new models will likely support up to two external displays, even when the lid is open. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest MacBook Pro and iMac models can be configured with a nano-texture display, which has a special coating that better scatters light to further minimize glare on the screen. It is possible that Apple will extend this option to the new MacBook Air models, but it might opt to keep the option exclusive to the MacBook Pro for differentiation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo major external design changes have been rumored for the next MacBook Air models.
