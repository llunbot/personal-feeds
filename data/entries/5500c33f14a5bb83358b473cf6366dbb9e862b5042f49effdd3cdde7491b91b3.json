{"title":"Facebook in Crisis Mode Amid Wall Street Journal Exposé","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/technology/facebook-instagram-teenagers.html","date":1633191725000,"content":"\n<p>Mike Isaac, Sheera Frenkel, and Ryan Mac, reporting for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But some of Facebook’s containment has at times backfired with\nits own workers. This week, the company <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/29/technology/facebook-instagram-research-hearing.html\">downplayed the internal\nresearch</a> that The Journal had partly based its articles on,\nsuggesting that the findings were limited and imprecise. That\nangered some employees who had worked on the research, three\npeople said. They have congregated on group chats to decry the\ncharacterizations as unfair, and some have privately threatened\nto quit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s what it takes for these researchers to think about quitting Facebook? Their research shows that Facebook is doing harm to society and harm to teenagers, but what makes them threaten to leave is having their work disparaged? What a magnet for sociopaths this company is.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/02/facebook-crisis-mode\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5500c33f14a5bb83358b473cf6366dbb9e862b5042f49effdd3cdde7491b91b3","category":"Tech"}
