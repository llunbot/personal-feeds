The new iPad mini even goes a few steps beyond the iPad Air with Apple's latest A15 Bionic chip, 5G on cellular models, and an upgraded front camera with Center Stage support.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEquipped with a larger 8.3-inch display, the new iPad mini is available with 64GB or 256GB of storage, and there are four colors to choose from, including Space Gray, Pink, Starlight, and Purple. Pricing starts at $499 in the United States.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/22/ipad-mini-6-unboxing-videos-and-reviews/\">iPad mini unboxing videos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/ipad-mini-2021/\">reviews</a> were shared on Wednesday, and first impressions of the device were generally positive.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile an iPad mini <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-mini\">ordered through Apple's website</a> today likely wouldn't arrive to your doorstep until October to November, select Apple Store locations will likely have limited in-store availability of the device starting this Friday.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/new-ipad-mini-begins-shipping/\">New iPad Mini Begins Shipping to Customers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-mini-begins-shipping-to-customers.2312853/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=tqHaT_1eB0k:ed9e_Tj0otI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=tqHaT_1eB0k:ed9e_Tj0otI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/tqHaT_1eB0k\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"03af5ed99a00195ca15e161a6b0b374ceddb6adbe277aa823739709df6921f0b","category":"Apple"}
