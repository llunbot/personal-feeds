{"title":"Idiot Cops Are Spreading Misinformation FUD About NameDrop","link":"https://sixcolors.com/link/2023/11/the-cops-think-ios-17s-namedrop-is-dangerous/","date":1702000721000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is so bizarre. NameDrop is a feature that lets you AirDrop \nyour contact information to someone else. For the feature to work, \nboth phones need to be unlocked and one has to be placed directly \nover the other. The entire new tap-to-connect system is built to \nuse physical proximity to confirm consent to sending or receiving \ndata, replacing the old system in which you could leave your \ndevice open to AirDrop from all users — and receive all sorts of \nnasty unwanted stuff from nearby randos. </p>\n\n<p>Once the physical act of tapping is done — it takes a few \nseconds, there’s a prominent animation, it’s nothing that is going \nto happen accidentally — you are given the option to share your \ncontact information with the other person, and get to choose which \ninformation is shared! If you only want to share a phone number \nand not your home address, you can do that! It’s entirely in the \nuser’s control. (If someone nefarious approached you and wanted to \nsteal your information, they’d be better off just grabbing your \nunlocked phone and running away with it.) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/07/cops-namedrop\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"866c248960c96c75f9a3f64064fe81f05cce82fd92b42bad46f4f0345a29f53d","category":"Tech"}
