There are new controller skins designed specifically for iPad, and the app supports multiple windows in Stage Manager and Split View, with games able to optionally pause when switching windows. The iPad version also supports external game controllers, and the developer Riley Testut says emulated games \"hand off\" seamlessly between iPhone and iPad, allowing gamers to continue playing where they left off. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nTestut says the need for BIOS files has now been eliminated, streamlining the setup process. Users should also notice a considerable improvement in the performance of DS games. The update introduces various menu button gestures, providing more intuitive navigation options. An experimental feature, \"Reverse Controller Skin Screens,\" has also been added, allowing users to switch controller skin screens at runtime, offering greater customization and flexibility during gameplay.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTestut previously explained that Delta for iPad had not originally been a development priority because the plan was to limit the emulator's launch to the EU via alternative app marketplace AltStore PAL, which doesn't support iPad.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, in a reversal of a years-old policy, Apple in April decided to allow retro game emulators on the ‌App Store‌. Delta was therefore made available on the App Store as a free download in the United States and other countries, with users supporting the developer via <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane?utm_source=search\">Patreon</a>.
