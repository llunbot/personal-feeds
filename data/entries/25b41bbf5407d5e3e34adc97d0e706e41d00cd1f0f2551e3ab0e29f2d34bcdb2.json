Devices from Belkin's Wemo smart home brand may still support Matter eventually, but Belkin will \"take a big step back, regroup, and rethink\" its product strategy before supporting Matter in any of its products. This is a reversal for Belkin, which <a href=\"https://www.belkin.com/pr-wemo-introduces-smart-video-doorbell.html\">had announced at CES 2022</a> that it planned to support Matter in several of its new accessories when the standard was ready.</p>\n<p>Some Wemo devices already support Thread, the underlying network protocol that Matter uses to allow devices in your home to communicate without flooding your Wi-Fi router. But at least for now, those devices remain tied to Apple's HomeKit ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>The oft-delayed Matter standard <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/matter-and-thread-could-fix-smart-home-compatibility-but-dont-get-excited-yet/\">was finally released in the fall of 2022</a>. It promises to break down the walls between smart home fiefdoms, taking the guesswork out of buying accessories and allowing for control of devices without having to install any device-specific apps. Matter devices should work whether you use HomeKit, Amazon's Alexa, Google Home, or even some combination of all three. Matter-compatible devices will also retain a basic level of functionality even if the company that made an accessory goes out of business or gets acquired and shut down.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924516#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924516&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"25b41bbf5407d5e3e34adc97d0e706e41d00cd1f0f2551e3ab0e29f2d34bcdb2","category":"Tech"}
