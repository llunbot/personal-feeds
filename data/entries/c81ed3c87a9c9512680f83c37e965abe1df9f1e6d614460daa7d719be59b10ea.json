It shares its low weight with its shorter travel sibling, the Shuttle SL, while it mirrors the travel and geometry of the full power Shuttle AM. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s as if those two models had a baby, and Pivot named it the Shuttle SL/AM. With the lighter Bosch SX motor and 400 Wh internal battery, the Shuttle SL/AM complete builds start at just under 40 pounds (18kg).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pivot Shuttle SL/AM lightweight eMTB</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SLAM-PivotCycles-001.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SLAM-PivotCycles-001.webp\" alt=\"Studio image of the new Pivot Shuttle SL/AM eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SLAM-PivotCycles-001.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SLAM-PivotCycles-001-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SLAM-PivotCycles-001-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SLAM-PivotCycles-001-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SLAM-PivotCycles-001-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SLAM-PivotCycles-001-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SLAM-PivotCycles-001-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Shuttle SL/AM has nice lines and only kinda looks like an e-bike <em>(All photos/Pivot)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, it looks like an excellent addition to the lineup, filling the gap for riders seeking a lighter eMTB with more travel — and capability — than the previous Shuttle SL offers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Shuttle SL/AM appears to be a carbon copy of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pivot-bosch-powered-2024-shuttle-am-emtb/\" target=\"_blank\">full power Shuttle AM</a>. We say carbon copy because, like the rest of the Pivot lineup, it comes in a full carbon fiber frame only. That also means it has 150mm of rear wheel travel paired with a 160mm travel fork and includes the same DW4 rear suspension platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so that’s 2mm more rear travel than the AM, but close enough, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SL/AM Tech Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pivot is still flying the Super Boost flag, and the frame has 157mm spacing in the rear. They claim Super Boost “<em>increases wheel stiffness substantially, which is a huge benefit on e-bikes.</em>” This is common across all Pivot MTB models, even though the majority of the industry is currently sticking with standard Boost spacing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All sizes come with 29-inch wheels front and rear, with the exception of the XS size, which is a dedicated mixed-wheel mullet bike. On that note, the XS frame adds a new fifth size, expanding the Shuttle SL/AM’s fit range. According to Pivot’s sizing recommendations, this should accommodate riders from 4’11” up to 6’7”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Adjustable SLAM Geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-Low.webp\"><img width=\"1165\" height=\"777\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-Low.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-Low.webp 1165w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-Low-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-Low-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-Low-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-Low-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-Low-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Geometry chart for the low flip-chip position.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-High.webp\"><img width=\"1162\" height=\"775\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-High.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-High.webp 1162w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-High-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-High-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-High-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-High-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-Geo-High-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Geometry chart for the high flip-chip position.</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Geometry-wise, the SL/AM is strikingly similar to the Shuttle AM. This includes the 64.5° head tube angle (high), relatively steep 76.9° effective seat tube angle (high), and 444mm chainstays across all sizes. Reach numbers stretch from 425mm on the XS to 500mm on the XL, so most riders should be able to find a good fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flip-chip steepens/slackens the head and seat tube angles by 0.4-degrees and raises/lowers the bottom bracket by 5mm between the low and high settings. The flip-chip can also be used to account for geometry changes, should you choose to run a mixed wheel setup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frames have all the common touches like internal cable routing and integrated chain slap and downtube protection. It appears that all sizes can fit full-size water bottles — or the range extender — inside the front triangle, with an additional mount point for tools/accessories on the underside of the top tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pivot Shuttle SL/AM Bosch SX Motor and Power</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pivot-Shuttle-SL-AM-motor.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pivot-Shuttle-SL-AM-motor.webp\" alt=\"Studio image of the Bosch SX motor on the Pivot Shuttle SL/AM\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pivot-Shuttle-SL-AM-motor.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pivot-Shuttle-SL-AM-motor-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pivot-Shuttle-SL-AM-motor-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pivot-Shuttle-SL-AM-motor-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pivot-Shuttle-SL-AM-motor-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pivot-Shuttle-SL-AM-motor-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pivot-Shuttle-SL-AM-motor-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The lighter-weight Bosch SX motor provides the pedal assistance while the integrated 400 Wh stores the power</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Shuttle SL/AM shares the SL moniker with its shorter-travel sibling, the two bikes have different motor systems. Unlike the Fazua-equipped (450W, 60Nm) <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pivot-shuttle-sl-ebike-emtb-light-weight-fazua-ride-60/\" target=\"_blank\">Shuttle SL</a>, the new SL/AM comes with the powerful but still lightweight Bosch Performance Line SX motor. The Bosch SX puts out up to 600W of peak power with 55Nm of torque. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <span>the Bosch SX motor’s higher peak power, Pivot even refers to it as having “f<em>ull-throttle power</em>.” Still, it h</span>as noticeably lower torque than full-power motors like the DJI Avinox, Specialized 3.1, Bosch CX, or even than the lightweight Fazua on the exiting Shuttle SL. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the Bosch SX motor still provides a solid boost to one’s pedaling effort, particularly with the lower weight of the SL/AM. And it’s reasonable to suspect that many of the folks seeking a lightweight e-bike aren’t after the full-power experience anyway. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This motor system includes Bosch’s handlebar mounted controls and top-tube integrated display. It also involves the Bosch x Pivot Flow app so riders can make adjustments to pedal assist modes, keep track of maintenance intervals, or monitor battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-with-Range-Extender.webp\"><img width=\"1621\" height=\"1081\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-with-Range-Extender.webp\" alt=\"Stock Image of the Shuttle SL/AM eMTB with the optional Range Extender\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-with-Range-Extender.webp 1621w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-with-Range-Extender-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-with-Range-Extender-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-with-Range-Extender-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-with-Range-Extender-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-with-Range-Extender-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shuttle-SL-AM-with-Range-Extender-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Adding the optional Bosch PowerMore 250Wh range extender bumps you up to 650Wh of battery for longer rides.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Batteries are one of the heaviest components of electric bikes, so it’s not too surprising that the Shuttle SL/AM comes with a modest 400Wh internal battery to help keep the weight down. The battery is housed inside the relatively slender downtube and can’t easily be removed for hot swaps or charging. The motor needs to be removed to access the battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, the SL/AM is compatible with the Bosch PowerMore 250Wh range extender (an extra $550), so you can have up to 650Wh of juice for longer rides, but a lighter ebike for everyday riding. The Range Extender has a claimed weight of 3.3 pounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Pivot Shuttle SL/AM Build Options and Pricing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pivot’s bikes aren’t exactly known for their affordability, and that trend continues here. The entry point is $8000 for the Ride Eagle 70/90 build, and the range tops out at $12,300 for the top-tier Team XX Eagle Transmission setup. All builds share the same frame, the same Bosch SX motor, and 400Wh internal battery. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that the Pro and Team builds come with Fox Factory Float X shocks (XS frames come with in-line Factory Float for clearance reasons), and Pivot offers a Live Valve NEO shock upgrade for $1,450. The Ride builds come with in-line Fox Performance Float shocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Pivot Shuttle SL/AM Team XX Transmission: $12,300</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
