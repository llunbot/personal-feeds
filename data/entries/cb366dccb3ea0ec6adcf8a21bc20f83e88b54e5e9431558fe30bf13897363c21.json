And if anyone can go long with a bold attack well before the infamous Poggio this weekend, it’s surely the in-form Tadej Pogačar…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the 2023 pro cycling schedule now in full flow – amid a flurry of emphatic wins from Pogačar and Slovenian compatriot Primož Roglič – an annual subscription to GCN+ means you won’t miss a moment of what’s shaping up to be one of the hottest seasons in living memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For just £39.99 for the year, you’ll get access to live, uninterrupted coverage of every race that matters – from road and track to cyclocross and MTB – plus on-demand highlights, a massive collection of cycling films and exclusive shows, on any screen, anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, even if you can’t tune in for the dramatic finale of the first Monument of the season this Saturday, with GCN+ you won’t miss a single pedal stroke of the entire 294km of Milan-San Remo action.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can Pogačar add another big win?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fresh from dominating his debut Paris-Nice, the relentless Tadej Pogačar will be among the favourites to snare another of cycling’s prized Monuments on the Via Roma this weekend. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The double Tour de France champion has already won Il Lombardia twice and Liège-Bastogne-Liège – making him the most complete rider of his generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the perma-form 24-year-old has a huge opportunity to add Milan-San Remo to his swelling palmarès. If his climbing prowess will make him a marked man on the Poggio, his ability to strike out from distance could see the UAE Team Emirates livewire achieve what most have failed to: winning the longest one-day race of the season with an early attack on La Cipressa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twelfth and fifth in his previous two appearances, Pogačar was well placed in last year’s finale before easing up during compatriot Matej Mohorič’s daredevil descent from the Poggio. But it would take a brave man to bet against a rider with nine victories already this season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GCN+ will put you at the sharp end of La Primavera as Pogačar tops a stellar startlist that includes Mathieu van der Poel, Wout van Aert, Julian Alaphilippe, Biniam Girmay and the defending champion Mohorič. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if it’s a shame that Britain’s Tom Pidcock misses out through injury, who knows, perhaps Mark Cavendish can roll back the years and repeat his winning performance from 2009? Okay, maybe not…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spring and beyond</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/GCN-Plus-2-970x546.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/GCN-Plus-2-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/GCN-Plus-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/GCN-Plus-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/GCN-Plus-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/GCN-Plus-2-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/GCN-Plus-2-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/GCN-Plus-2.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>After the San Remo show, the Monuments come thick and fast with the men’s and women’s peloton tackling the prestigious Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix cobblestone classics on the first two weekends of April. GCN+ brings you every unmissable moment from these famous races as well as every other event throughout 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And once the dust settles on the cobbles and hills of the Ardennes, the focus will switch to the three historic Grand Tours – as Pogačar looks to wrest the yellow jersey back from Jonas Vingegaard in the Tour de France, while Belgian world champion Remco Evenepoel does battle against Primož Roglič and Geraint Thomas in the Giro d’Italia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throw in the huge array of one-day contests and exciting stage races – not to forget World Championships on tarmac and track, grass and gravel – and GCN+ really has all the bases covered from the men’s and women’s calendar, both live and on demand.
