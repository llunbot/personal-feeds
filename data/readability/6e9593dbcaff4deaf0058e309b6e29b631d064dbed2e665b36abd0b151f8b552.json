{"title":"Grace Brown’s season is over","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/grace-browns-season-is-over/","date":1629254517000,"content":"<div><div><p>Grace Brown’s season has come to a premature end due to complications with a shoulder injury sustained at the Giro Donne in July.</p><p>In an Instagram post on Tuesday evening, Brown (BikeExchange) explained that her seemingly minor shoulder injury was worse than first thought.</p><p>“Off-season is here, much earlier than expected or desired,” Brown wrote. “What seemed to be a benign shoulder injury over a month ago, has stubbornly hung around and revealed itself as something more serious.</p><p>“My tendons have pulled some bone fragments from the head of my humerus and are preventing proper healing. Basically I need surgery if I don’t want a bung shoulder for life.”</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Earlier this month FDJ Nouvelle-Aquitaine Futuroscope announced Brown would join the French outfit next season on a two-year deal. As such, the Giro Donne – where Brown crashed on stage 8 – was the 29-year-old’s last race in BikeExchange colours.</p><p>“I’m sad about all the good things I will miss, especially my final races with [BikeExchange] and the Flanders World Championships,” Brown wrote. “But I also need to remember that I’ve had such a good year up to this point, and I can be satisfied with that.”</p><p>Brown’s season started with silver medals in both the road race and time trial at the Australian Road Nationals. She finished second at Danilith Nokere Koerse, won Brugge-De Panne in late March – her first WorldTour victory – and then won a stage of the Vuelta a Burgos. In a season that included 14 top-10 finishes, Brown took third at the Tour of Flanders, likewise in the individual time trial at the Giro Donne, and finished fifth at La Course.</p><p>More recently Brown represented Australia at the Tokyo Olympics where she finished fourth in the time trial, just seven seconds off the bronze medal.</p><blockquote></blockquote></div></div>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"6e9593dbcaff4deaf0058e309b6e29b631d064dbed2e665b36abd0b151f8b552","category":"Cycling"}
