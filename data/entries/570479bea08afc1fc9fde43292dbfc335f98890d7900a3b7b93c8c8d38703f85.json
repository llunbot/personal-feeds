The X series brings the renowned Pinarello level of finish and prestige within the grasp of riders who love to ride for riding’s sake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a focus on endurance, rather than being a pro peloton race weapon, the X series is designed to offer all-day riding comfort infused with Pinarello’s performance DNA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the historic Italian brand’s specially selected materials, unique geometry and innovative frame design that help these bikes strike the perfect balance between comfort and performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Magic carpet ride</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The expression ‘endurance bike’ can all too often be synonymous with ‘this bike is way too heavy and won’t carve a corner’. Not so with the Pinarello X series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These bikes are for riders who want a bike they can ride in comfort all day but still appreciate – and benefit from – the handling prowess for which Pinarello is universally applauded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we even touch on the ways in which the frame does this, first look at those tyres – there’s clearance for 32mm tyres on the X series, which allows not only a whopping contact patch for confident cornering, but also for the running of tubes (or, even better, a tubeless setup) at lower pressures.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello X series\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>High-volume, low-pressure tyres soak up the worst of the road surface, imbuing the rider with all-day enjoyment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond this, the unique geometry of the X series allows for a more comfortable position when fun takes precedence over performance. The more upright riding position is designed to reduce pressure on the rider’s back, allowing you to clock up the miles in comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the X series still has plenty to offer when you want to inject some speed into the ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aero for all</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aerodynamics isn’t just important for performance-level bikes. After all, where’s the fun in riding if you’re having to put in needless extra effort to get where you’re going?</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello X series\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Consequently, the Pinarello X series has been designed to maximise your pedal strokes and share the thrill of a bike that’s been designed to cut through the air with optimum efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employing the distinctive Pinarello approach to frameset design, these bikes have an asymmetrical frame. Recognising the imbalance of forces going through a frame thanks to the torsional forces on the drive side, Pinarello balances this out through clever design to give every ride perfect symmetry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fine-tuned to perfection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Those rear stays aren’t just designed for speed, but also for comfort. The speciﬁcally designed ‘ﬂexy stays’, which are engineered to have a slight curve, are unique to Pinarello, and allow the frame to also advantage of the T600 carbon ﬁbre layup to absorb vibrations from the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No need to add any fancy mechanical damping system to the frame – after all, that would only add significantly to the overall weight of the bike and reduce its handling performance. The T600 carbon used throughout offers the perfect blend of light weight, responsiveness and damping.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello X series\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The X series also shares another common Pinarello design trait: the Onda fork. The distinctive wavy, hunting dagger profile of the fork instantly marks the bike out as a Pinarello, and the technology has been in the company’s arsenal since 2000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shape of the fork legs delivers precise turning ability and stability, and contributes to the reduction of longitudinal and lateral shocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s attention to detail like this that sets a Pinarello apart from the crowd. This is demonstrated even further by the integration of the seatpost clamp, which reduces the overall size of the seat tube for better integration, reduced weight and improved aerodynamic performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Breaking down barriers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With Pinarello, it’s no longer a struggle to find a bike that fits. The brand offers the X series in nine frame sizes – more options than any of its competitors.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello X series\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/pinarello-x-series-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Combine this with the fact that the bikes are bristling with reliable, accessible componentry, and the X series is practically built for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The white or pearl white Pinarello X1 comes with a full mechanical Shimano 105 groupset – a byword for easily maintainable, dependable components – offering trickle-down tech from the Japanese brand’s higher end products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its stablemate the Pinarello X3 benefits from an electronic groupset, employing Shimano 105 Di2 in a thoroughly 21st century approach to seamless shifting. It’s available in either black or red/black.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whichever model of Pinarello X series you choose, comfort and performance are guaranteed in equal measure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• <a href=\"https://pinarello.com/uk/en/bikes/road/endurance/pinarello-x\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to discover more about the Pinarello X series</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/pinarello-x-series\">Pinarello X series: The perfect balance</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"570479bea08afc1fc9fde43292dbfc335f98890d7900a3b7b93c8c8d38703f85","category":"Cycling"}
