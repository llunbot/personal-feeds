Are your bikepacking bags, commuting panniers, or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-tunitas-carryall-basket-tote-137-a-grab-and-go-tote/\" target=\"_blank\">basket bags</a> getting so much use, they’re getting worn out? Well, back in early February of this year, <a href=\"https://us.restrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Restrap</a> unveiled its new <a href=\"https://us.restrap.com/products/repair-pack?_pos=1&amp;_psq=repair+packs&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0\" target=\"_blank\">Repair Packs</a>. These repair packs are crafted from repurposed waste materials from Restap’s manufacturing process. You can use them to patch those holes in your bags. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed with sustainability in mind, the Repair Packs allow riders to maintain and extend the lifespan of their gear. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Black iron-on repair patches are applied to bags, repairing most holes and/or areas of wear after heavy use. The patches are waterproof when applied. The patches are held in the supplied wallet which is made of repurposed waste fabric from Restrap’s cutting process. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Restrap-Repair-Packs-Wallets-ready-to-go-e1715700598333.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"721\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Restrap-Repair-Packs-Wallets-ready-to-go-e1715700598333.jpeg\" alt=\"Restrap Repair Packs Wallets ready to go\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Restrap-Repair-Packs-Wallets-ready-to-go-e1715700598333.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Restrap-Repair-Packs-Wallets-ready-to-go-e1715700598333-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Restrap-Repair-Packs-Wallets-ready-to-go-e1715700598333-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Restrap-Repair-Packs-Wallets-ready-to-go-e1715700598333-768x433.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Restrap-Repair-Packs-Wallets-ready-to-go-e1715700598333-1200x675.jpeg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Restrap)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Repair Packs offer an accessible and sustainable way for adventurers to address wear and tear on their beloved bikepacking bags.

This practice transforms what would have been discarded into valuable resources for repair and maintenance. By utilizing these waste materials, Restrap aims to close the loop on its production cycles and contribute to a more circular economy. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Restrap-Repair-Packs-making-the-pack.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"837\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Restrap-Repair-Packs-making-the-pack.jpeg\" alt=\"Restrap Repair Packs making the pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Restrap-Repair-Packs-making-the-pack.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Restrap-Repair-Packs-making-the-pack-297x194.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Restrap-Repair-Packs-making-the-pack-120x78.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Restrap-Repair-Packs-making-the-pack-768x502.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Repair Packs Retail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $6 (includes three patches)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pouch colors may vary, but all patches are black. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Restrap’s Repair Packs are available exclusively through the <a href=\"https://us.restrap.com/products/repair-pack?_pos=1&amp;_psq=repair+packs&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0\" target=\"_blank\">Spares</a> page on their website and will be part of their comprehensive customer aftercare program.
