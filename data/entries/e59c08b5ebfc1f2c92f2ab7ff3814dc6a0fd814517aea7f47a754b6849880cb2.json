The company recently confirmed it's ditching the storied alert slider in favor of an Apple-like shortcut button called the Plus Key, and that's not the only trend it'll chase with its latest phones. OnePlus has also announced an expanded collection of AI features for translation, photography, screen capture, and more.

There will be AI VoiceScribe, a feature that records and summarizes calls in popular messaging and video chat apps.

That suggests to us it's basically another chatbot on your phone, like Motorola's Ask and Search feature, which we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/motorola-razr-and-razr-ultra-2025-review-cool-as-hell-but-too-much-ai/\">didn't love</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/oneplus-plans-huge-expansion-of-ai-features-on-its-phones-starting-with-13s/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/oneplus-plans-huge-expansion-of-ai-features-on-its-phones-starting-with-13s/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e59c08b5ebfc1f2c92f2ab7ff3814dc6a0fd814517aea7f47a754b6849880cb2","category":"Tech"}
