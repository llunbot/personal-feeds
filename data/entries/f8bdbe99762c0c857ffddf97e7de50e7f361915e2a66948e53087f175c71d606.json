Hague and Gorbunov safely arrived at the space station Sunday to begin a five-month stay at the orbiting research complex.</p>\n<p>The Falcon 9's second stage Merlin vacuum engine fired for more than six minutes to place the Crew Dragon spacecraft into orbit after liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. The engine was supposed to reignite later to steer the upper stage on a trajectory back into Earth's atmosphere for disposal over the South Pacific Ocean, ensuring the rocket doesn't remain in orbit as a piece of space junk.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053306#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053306&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f8bdbe99762c0c857ffddf97e7de50e7f361915e2a66948e53087f175c71d606","category":"Tech"}
