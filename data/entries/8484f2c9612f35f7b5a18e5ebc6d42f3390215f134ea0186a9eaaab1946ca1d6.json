The wide rims make riding over less-than-perfect tarmac easy and consequently quicker. They also inspired confidence on descents because they help create a wider contact patch between your tyre and the ground.</p>\n<p>The rim profile seems almost impervious to crosswinds – even with the 55mm-deep rear wheel and 49mm-deep front wheel. The rear hub with its 40t ratchet system engages quickly, which pays dividends on climbs.</p>\n<p>Overall, the wheels are incredibly easy to ride.

But find a tyre that fits and the wide rim combined with the low pressures you can run with a tubeless setup means this version of the 404 is much more comfortable than its predecessor.</p>\n<p>These wheels are ideal for road purists looking for speed, but if you want something a bit more versatile you might want to consider the shallower Zipp 303 Firecrest wheelset.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/zipp-404-firecrest-tubeless-disc-wheelset-review/\">Read our full Zipp 404 Firecrest Tubeless Disc review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Boyd Prologue Series 44mm</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Boyd’s Prologue wheel borrows the wind tunnel-optimised rim shape of the brand’s premium line, Podium.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<div></div>\n<ul><li>£762/€905/$1,050 as tested</li>\n<li>Well priced with 44mm-deep carbon rims</li>\n<li>A comfortable ride that’s not over-stiff</li>\n</ul><p>Available for either disc or rim brakes, the Prologue wheels are 44mm deep with a 27mm external/19mm internal rim with the same profile as the brand’s premium Podium wheels.

On the road, this helps the wheels accelerate quickly, with the stiff and responsive design responding quickly to your input.</p>\n<p>The wheelset is also impressive on descents. This is in part due to the 21mm internal rim width, which enables you to fit wide tyres. On the flat, the wheelset isn’t as fast as a deeper-rimmed alternative, but anyone looking at climbing wheels should be well aware of this.</p>\n<p>Despite the climbing ability, the Speed 25 would still be a great choice as an all-round wheelset, with the overall design and ceramic bearings providing a smooth ride. Just watch out for the 120kg rider weight limit.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/fulcrum-speed-25-wheelset-review/\">Read our full Fulcrum Speed 25 wheelset review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Parcours Strade</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Parcours’ Strade wheels have different profiles front to rear.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£999<span> as tested</span></li>\n<li>Premium looks and progressive design</li>\n<li>Fast, with good crosswind stability</li>\n</ul><p>The result of 12 months of development, including wind-tunnel testing, the Strade wheels have different front and rear rim profiles because Parcours’ research showed that front and rear wheels experience different average wind yaw angles.</p>\n<p>The 49mm-deep, 32mm-wide front wheel has a more U-shaped profile, while the 54mm-deep, 30mm-wide rear is more V-shaped to compensate for this.

They’re expensive though, especially when compared to the already excellent Zipp 303 Firecrest.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/zipp-353-nsw-wheelset-review/\">Read our full Zipp 353 NSW wheelset review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<hr /><h2>Best rim brake road bike wheels</h2>\n<h3>DT Swiss P-1800 Spline</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We’ve been consistently impressed by DT’s Spline family.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n</div>\n<ul><li>£335/€388/$483<span> as tested</span></li>\n<li>Good-value tubeless package</li>\n<li>Aero spokes and lightweight for the price</li>\n</ul><p>Priced at just £335 (and often found cheaper online), DT Swiss’s P-1800 Spline wheels have a lot going for them.</p>\n<p>At 1,630g, they won’t weigh you down and the 17.5mm internal rim width is wide enough to provide a nice round tyre profile with 23 to 28mm tyres.</p>\n<p>Pick-up from the standard pawl system is a little slow, but this is splitting hairs on a wheelset at this price point.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/dt-swiss-p-1800-spline-wheelset-review/\">Read our full DT Swiss P-1800 Spline wheelset review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Hunt 4 Season Aero</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Hunt’s 4 Season Aero wheels are great for year-round riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£369/€469/$499<span> as tested</span></li>\n<li>Reliable build</li>\n<li>Painless tubeless setup</li>\n</ul><p>Hunt’s 4 Season Aero wheelset is a dependable, relatively affordable and unfussy alloy rim brake wheelset that is great for all-season use.</p>\n<p>Built with a sensibly high spoke count, up-specced winter-proof bearings and a wide-ish rim, the wheels presented no issues in testing.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/hunt-4-season-aero-wheelset-review/\">Read our full Hunt 4 Season Aero wheelset review</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Vision SC55</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The SC55 is available in both rim-brake and disc-brake versions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£1,150/€1,228/$1,462<span> as tested</span></li>\n<li>Effective rim-braking performance</li>\n<li>Available for disc brakes at the same price</li>\n</ul><p>The latest version of the Vision SC55 has a new 19mm internal/27mm external rim profile that’s been wind-tunnel tested and is tubeless-ready.</p>\n<p>We were impressed at the wheels’ ability to smooth the road and add comfort to our rides.

On the rear wheel, the hub features a freehub mechanism (unless you’re riding a fixed-wheel bike), which allows the bike to coast, but drives forward as desired when you pedal. The hub contains the bearings that the axle rides on, and the axle is the part that attaches the wheel to the bike. It also lets you mount a rotor if designed for disc brakes.</li>\n<li><strong>Spokes:</strong> Pieces of wire or sometimes carbon fibre that lace the hubs to the rim. The number of spokes per wheel and the material choice is important. In most wheels, the spokes are under tension and this is what gives the wheel its structure.</li>\n<li><strong>Nipples:</strong> At the rim end (usually), the spokes thread into a special nut called a nipple. Most wheels can be straightened (trued) by adjusting spoke tension via the nipple.</li>\n<li><strong>Rim:</strong> Sitting on the outside of the wheel, the rim holds the tyre and provides a braking surface for rim-brake-equipped bikes.</li>\n</ul><h3>Types of road bike wheels</h3>\n<p>Just as road bikes are now increasingly being designated according to their use (race, endurance, aero, gravel and so on), wheels also fit into similar categories.</p>\n<p>Knowing what type of rider you are and what you want out of your wheel upgrade will simplify and narrow your choices.</p>\n<h4>Climbing wheels</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Hunt’s 991g Hill Climb SL is a dedicated climbing wheelset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley</i></span></div>\n<p>Weight is felt most when ascending, so a wheel suited to climbing is usually designed with low weight in mind. Such wheels generally feature a shallow-profile rim and a low spoke count.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of such a wheel is seen in ride quality. Typically, the deeper a rim gets in its shape, the harsher the ride – therefore climbing wheels are often more compliant.</p>\n<p>Where a wheelset is below 1,500g and doesn’t claim to be aerodynamic, it can often be put into the climbing category. When budget is no issue, a super-light climbing wheelset should weigh between 900g and 1,300g.</p>\n<h4>Mid-section aerodynamic wheels</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A 35 to 50mm deep rim is considered to be a mid-section aero wheel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Aerodynamic wheels have quickly become a popular choice for adding some free speed and creating that ‘pro look’. An aerodynamic wheel will usually feature a deeper section rim, with a rim depth of around 35mm being the typical starting point. They’re typically made of carbon, although there are alloy options available too and the majority are designed for disc brakes.</p>\n<p>As aero designs have improved in recent years, there has been a big uptake in these mid-depth wheels which, unlike some deep-section models (see below), now provide a sensible balance between low weight, ride quality and improved performance against the wind.</p>\n<h4>Deep-section aerodynamic wheels</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rims deeper than 50mm are considered to be deep-section.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>When speed is a priority, a deep-section rim of 50mm or more can potentially cut through the air with less aerodynamic drag.</p>\n<p>However, the additional depth can cause problems if riding in high crosswinds and often adds weight, which is why mid-depth wheels have become a popular compromise outside of time trials and fast sprint courses.</p>\n<p>Riders who race on deep aerodynamic wheels will often own a set of training wheels for use outside of racing.</p>\n<h4>Training/winter wheels</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Training wheels should be capable of withstanding everyday abuse.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While speed, low friction and low weight are a priority for racing wheels, training or ‘everyday’ wheels must be durable and able to take a beating.</p>\n<p>Because rims on rim brake bikes wear out over time with braking, particularly if you’re riding through winter, having a cheaper set of wheels for training can extend the life of your race wheels.</p>\n<p>A custom, handbuilt wheelset – where replacement spokes and rims are relatively cheap and easy to source – is a good choice (see below for more on these). Other options are budget wheels from major brands, which can be well built and have parts that aren’t too expensive to replace.</p>\n<p>For this type of usage, expect a wheelset weight of 1,500 to 1,800g for something that is well priced. A budget wheelset is likely to weigh 1,900g or more.</p>\n<h3>What type of tyres do my wheels use?</h3>\n<p>There are three types of tyres for road bikes and each type needs a specific rim. For more details, read our explainer on the differences between <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/gear/article/angryasian-tubes-tubeless-or-tubular-41428/\">tubes, tubeless and tubular</a>.</p>\n<h4>Clincher tyres explained</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Most road wheels are designed for use with clincher tyres with many also tubeless ready.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pirelli</i></span></div>\n<p>The term ‘clincher’ refers to standard tyres that use separate <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\">inner tubes</a> to hold the air, which pushes the tyre bead into a hooked rim to hold it in place.</p>\n<p>This is the most common wheel type on road bikes. Generally, where tyre type isn’t mentioned, it’s safe to assume it’s a clincher.</p>\n<h4>Tubeless tyres explained</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tubeless tyres are used with a sealant.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Tubeless tyre technology has been a thing in mountain biking for a long time, but it’s now making serious inroads on road bike wheels too.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, tubeless tyres don’t require an inner tube – just like a car tyre. Instead, sealant and tubeless-ready rims are used to create what is essentially an airtight clincher system.</p>\n<p>Manufacturers claim that removing the inner tube can decrease rolling resistance, banish the risk of pinch flats at lower inflation pressures and that the sealant can seal small punctures while riding.</p>\n<p>For more info on road tubeless technology, check out our podcast episode where some of our most knowledgeable writers sat down to discuss <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/bikeradar-podcast-ep-7-road-tubeless-the-what-why-and-how/\">the what, why and how of road tubeless tyres</a>.</p>\n<h4>Tubular tyres explained</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tubular tyres have to be glued to the wheel rim, so it helps to have a professional mechanic.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Tubulars (often shortened to ‘tubs’) are the oldest type of road bike tyres. They usually consist of an inner tube sewn into a fully enclosed tyre casing, which then has to be glued or taped onto a compatible rim.</p>\n<p>Tubeless tubulars do exist (i.e. an airtight tubular with no inner tube), but these are relatively uncommon.</p>\n<p>The advantage of tubular tyres largely lies in the fact that a tubular wheelset can be made relatively lighter. This is because the material used to create a rim that can withstand the high internal pressure of a clincher or tubeless tyre adds significant weight.</p>\n<p>Tubular tyres can also be ridden flat for short distances, which can be advantageous in a race.</p>\n<p>It’s for these reasons, and tradition, that tubular tyres and wheels are still dominant in the professional peloton (where riders don’t have to fix their own punctures or pay for new tyres) and hill climb events, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tubeless-tyres-pro-peloton/\">though this is beginning to change, albeit slowly</a>.</p>\n<h3>Road wheel rim materials</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Modern wheels are available in two common material types: carbon fibre or aluminium.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Aluminium is typically found in any wheel below £800 / $1,200 / AU$1,500, with carbon wheels generally being priced above that (although we are starting to see brands offer carbon wheels below that mark).</p>\n<p>Just like with road bike frames, carbon fibre has become the standard material for performance race wheels, where stiffness, weight and aerodynamics are the priorities.</p>\n<p>Aluminium still sets the benchmark for braking performance on rim brake wheels, especially in wet conditions. Carbon rims have made massive strides in this area in recent years, though. However, if your bike has disc brakes, this isn’t a concern.</p>\n<h3>What diameter are road wheels?</h3>\n<p>The standard road bike rim size is 700c, with the name coming from an approximate metric measurement taken from the diameter of the wheel including an inflated tyre.</p>\n<p>Some brands will spec a 650b wheel on smaller frame sizes to improve their geometry and 650b is an important option for gravel bikes, but the vast majority of modern road bikes use a 700c wheelset.</p>\n<p>If you look closely enough at your road bike tyre, you’ll likely see numbers such as 23-622 or 25-622. These numbers are the international tyre sizing standard, with the first numbers referring to the tyre width (23mm, 25mm) and the second series of numbers, in this case 622, referring to the bead seat diameter (BSD) of the tyre designed to fit a 700c rim.</p>\n<h3>Road wheel rim width explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rim width has an effect on the profile of a tyre once inflated.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While the 622mm bead seat diameter is an industry standard, the width of the rim is not.</p>\n<p>Recently there has been a trend towards wider rims because they offer greater tyre volume and a stiffer wheel, which in turn provides a more comfortable ride, improved bike control, lower rolling resistance and potentially fewer pinch flats.</p>\n<p>The confusing part is that some brands quote external rim width, while others internal.</p>\n<p>Looking at internal width, anything under 14mm is considered very narrow, 20mm and over is wide and anything between is sufficient for common 25mm tyres, although they’ll sit happily on wider rims too.</p>\n<p>Internal width is important because of the effect it has on tyre profile. Narrow internal rim widths give tyres a ‘lightbulb’ cross-section which can narrow the contact patch and reduce grip, whereas wider internal rim widths cause the contact patch to flatten out and increase in size.</p>\n<p>For those racing, wider rims have been shown to be more aerodynamic too, as the rim can integrate with the tyre more smoothly. This is because a wider rim can help form a smoother aerofoil shape with wider road tyres.</p>\n<h3>Axle sizes</h3>\n<p>We’ve got a separate guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-axle-standards/\">road bike axle standards</a>, but here’s a quick run-down…</p>\n<p>If your road bike was built in the last 20 years and has rim brakes, it most likely has a 130mm width quick release rear axle (written as 130mm QR or 130 × 9mm), and a 100mm (100 QR, or 100 × 9mm) quick-release front.</p>\n<p>However, the introduction of disc brakes greatly confused this and for a while there were multiple standards for bikes with disc brakes, most of which were thru-axle designs borrowed from mountain biking.</p>\n<p>If you were an early adopter of road disc brakes, it’s best to refer back to the manufacturer of your bike to find out exactly what standard is used on your model.</p>\n<p>That said, it looks like the industry has finally settled on one unifying standard for disc brake road bikes: 12mm thru-axles with 100mm spacing in the front dropouts and 142mm spacing at the rear.</p>\n<p>If only they could do the same for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket standards</a>…</p>\n<h3>Freehubs and drivetrain compatibility</h3>\n<p>Situated on the right side of the rear hub, the freehub is what holds the drivetrain’s cassette and allows drive to the rear wheel.</p>\n<p>Although most 11-speed designs are now backwards compatible, you must be careful to match the freehub to your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/drivetrains-explained-all-of-the-parts-that-make-your-bike-go/\">drivetrain</a> brand.</p>\n<h4>Shimano/SRAM 11-speed freehubs</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The freehub on DT Swiss’s GRC1400 rear wheel is interchangeable between Shimano 11-speed, SRAM XD and 12-speed road compatible SRAM XDR standards. Not all wheels offer such wide compatibility, however.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This spline system hasn’t changed a great deal in the last 20 years, with the exception of 11-speed forcing a wider freehub. Shimano-compatible 11-speed wheels usually include a spacer for use with 8-, 9- or 10-speed cassettes.</p>\n<p>SRAM 11-speed cassettes use Shimano’s spline system, so are cross-compatible. The exceptions are newer SRAM cassettes designed for its XD driver (more on this below).</p>\n<h4>Shimano 12-speed</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This is Shimano’s 12-speed Micro Spline freehub for mountain bikes, which isn’t compatible with 12-speed Shimano road cassettes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Josh Patterson / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Shimano’s new 12-speed cassettes and wheels come with a new spline pattern too, with smaller more numerous splines, although it’s not the same as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-decided-to-create-a-freehub-standard/\">Micro Spline</a> format used in its 12-speed MTB freehubs. The new pattern means that 12-speed Shimano road cassettes are backward compatible with 11-speed freehubs, but you won’t be able to fit an 11-speed cassette to a freehub with the new spline pattern.</p>\n<h4>Campagnolo freehubs</h4>\n<p>The freehub diameter and splines of Campagnolo freehubs are very different to that of Shimano/SRAM.</p>\n<p>If you have Campagnolo gearing, ensure that the freehub body is matched. Many aftermarket wheel brands will sell freehub bodies as a replacement part – so it’s possible to switch a Campagnolo wheel to Shimano and vice-versa (Shimano-branded wheels being a key exception here).</p>\n<p>It’s perfectly possible to use an 11-speed Campagnolo cassette with a Shimano or SRAM 11-speed drivetrain (and vice versa) though, so you might not need to switch the freehub at all in that instance.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/campagnolo-record-12-speed-first-ride-review/\">Campagnolo went 12-speed</a> it simply reduced the width of the 12-speed chains and cassettes to fit on existing 11-speed Campagnolo compatible freehubs. Hallelujah.</p>\n<p>The latest Campagnolo wheels use a new standard called N3W. This uses a freehub body that’s shorter and compatible with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review/\">Ekar gravel groupset</a>. Campagnolo makes an extender that fits on the N3W freehub, so that it will also accept its road cassettes.</p>\n<h4>SRAM XD and XDR driver</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> XD driver is SRAM’s solution to allowing the use of cogs smaller than 11t.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<p>The increasing popularity of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-convert-your-bike-to-a-1x-drivetrain/\">1×</a> and the advent of 12-speed drivetrains (and the subsequent desire for cogs smaller than 11t) has thrown a spanner in the cross-compatibility charts.</p>\n<p>SRAM’s solution is the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/sram-xd-driver-body-explained/\">XD driver</a> for off-road and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-12-speed-red-etap-axs-hrd-review/\">XDR driver</a> for road use, which are essentially just new freehub standards that enable the use of cassette cogs down to a tiny 9t.</p>\n<p>Rather like tubeless tyres and disc brakes, this tech began life on mountain bikes before eventually making its way over to road wheels with the introduction of SRAM’s AXS groupsets. The XDR freehub is slightly wider than XD, so you can run an MTB cassette on an XDR body (with a spacer), but not vice versa.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">Everything you need to know about road bike groupsets</a></li>\n</ul><h3>Freehub ratchet speeds</h3>\n<p>A feature that’s commonly overlooked in a hub is the ratchet speed, also expressed as points of engagement or the angle of uptake. Hubs typically don’t have fewer than 18 points of engagement per 360-degree revolution, but hubs that offer more can provide the feeling of faster acceleration and pick-up out of corners. Typical values are between 24 and 48, but some hub designs go much higher.</p>\n<p>Some brands quote points of engagement, while others tell you their hubs’ engagement angle, which is 360 degrees divided by the number of points of engagement.</p>\n<h3>Road wheel braking explained</h3>\n<p>Rim brakes have long been the standard for road bikes. But as mentioned above, disc braking, a technology proven with cars, motorbikes and mountain bikes, is rapidly taking over for road cyclists.</p>\n<p>Disc brakes add another element to the decision-making process.</p>\n<h4>Disc brake road wheels</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Disc brakes are now the standard on performance road bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Disc brake wheels feature a hub with a mount for the disc rotor.</p>\n<p>Because of the high forces these rotors exert on a wheel when braking, disc-brake wheels often feature higher spoke counts, which add a little weight.</p>\n<p>The flip side is that rims on disc brake wheels can be made lighter and more aerodynamic because they aren’t also required to act as a braking surface.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that fitting disc brakes to a road bike isn’t as simple as swapping out the wheels; both the frame and fork must be designed to accept disc brakes too.</p>\n<p>When buying disc brake wheels, it’s worth being aware that there are two types of rotor mount: centrelock and six-bolt.</p>\n<p>Centrelock is a splined system originally from Shimano, which is more-or-less standard on road bike wheels. It can also be used with six-bolt rotors with the use of an adaptor. Six-bolt hubs can only fit six-bolt rotors.</p>\n<h4>Rim brake road wheels</h4>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rim brakes are now mostly found on entry-level road bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Many road bike wheels are still designed for use with rim brakes, which means the rim must offer a consistent braking surface.</p>\n<p>This is why good quality aluminium rims claim to offer a ‘machined’ surface, which generally guarantees an even braking surface at manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Over time, braking in gritty conditions will not just wear down the brake pads, but the rims too. A worn brake track can be dangerous because the high pressure of a road tyre can cause the rim to crack and explode.</p>\n<p>Look for a small dimple or groove on the surface of your rim – this is a wear indicator. When it starts disappearing, it’s time to get your rim or wheel replaced.</p>\n<p>Carbon rims typically don’t perform as well when braking, especially in the wet or in extreme conditions such as descending long, steep mountains and need specialist pads. Keep this in mind if you’re considering a carbon wheel for everyday use or are swapping between carbon and alloy rims, as you’ll need to swap the pads too.</p>\n<h3>Spokes</h3>\n<p>Spokes lace the hub to the rim. Generally, wheels with higher spoke counts are stronger and more durable, but this comes with a weight and slight aero penalty.</p>\n<p>Typically a spoke is made from a piece of stainless steel wire that’s been cold-forged and then had a thread added to it. Some higher-end wheels may use spokes made from aluminium, carbon fibre or even titanium.</p>\n<p>When it comes to a quality wheel build, correct spoke tension is critical. Too loose and the spokes can unwind, and the constant flex will eventually lead to broken spokes or cracked rims. Too tight and there’s an increased risk of the rim cracking at the spoke attachment point or a nipple failing.</p>\n<h3>Factory vs. handbuilt wheels</h3>\n<p>The merits of factory vs. handbuilt wheels are often argued.</p>\n<p>Confusingly, factory wheels are, in fact, commonly built at least partly by hand. The key distinction however is that factory wheels are built to an exact specification and you buy them as an off-the-shelf item, often with proprietary spoke and rim designs.</p>\n<p>Handbuilt wheels take a more classical approach, where the hubs, spokes, nipples and rims can be bought separately and chosen to best suit a rider’s individual needs.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, race wheels are mostly sold as factory options. The big wheel brands dominate this space due to their research, development and marketing through sponsored teams.</p>\n<p>Handbuilt wheels are commonly kept for training, long-distance and everyday uses. However, there are of course examples where the opposites are true.</p>\n<h3>Buying second-hand road bike wheels</h3>\n<p>Wheels can be expensive and second-hand items are commonly available for sale. Just as with a bike, the actual use and repair history of the wheels is crucially important when buying used.</p>\n<p>Your first step is to check how straight (true) the wheel is. Give it a spin and ensure it’s not buckled. Also, check for any ‘hop’ within the height of the rim – nobody wants an egg-shaped wheel.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Rims:</strong> Check for wear of the brake surface (on rim brake wheels), which should be flat and without any concave shape. Look for any sign of chips and then inspect the whole rim for cracks, especially around the spokes.</li>\n<li><strong>Spokes:</strong> Check that all the spokes are straight and without gouges or scratches. Squeeze the spokes two at a time – all the ones on the right should feel roughly even in tension with each other. Now do the same for the left, which should feel similar. Unevenness is a sign of a bent rim that’s being held in shape by spoke tension.</li>\n<li><strong>Hubs:</strong> Spin the wheels by holding onto the hub axles. The bearings should spin freely without any drag or notching. Check that the freehub spins yet grabs when you rotate it forward. Also, be sure to double-check freehub compatibility with your gears (as outlined above).</li>\n</ul><h3>Road wheel glossary</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>Asymmetric rim:</strong> As the rear cassette sits on the right side of the hub, the point at which the spokes attach from the rear hub is offset to the left. With this, an asymmetric rim is designed to give a more direct path from these offset spokes to the rim, with the desired result being a sturdier and stiffer wheel, and more even left–right spoke tensions</li>\n<li><strong>Axle:</strong> The hub spins around the axle, which is attached to the dropouts of the frame and fork. On a road bike, the axle is always hollow and designed to work with a thru-axle or quick release skewer</li>\n<li><strong>Bladed spoke:</strong> A flattened spoke that’s designed to cut through the wind with less resistance. Bladed spokes are common in high-end wheels and also help to provide an edge for a tool to hold onto, which can allow for a higher spoke tension to be achieved. Top spoke brands DT Swiss and Sapim both claim that their best bladed spokes are not only their lightest option, but also the strongest and most durable</li>\n<li><strong>Butted spoke:</strong> A process that sees the centre of the spoke being made thinner than the outer sections. When done correctly, this encourages the spoke to flex away from weak points, therefore leading to improved durability at a lower weight. Double-butted means two different thicknesses and triple-butted means three thicknesses</li>\n<li><strong>Cartridge bearing:</strong> In this system, bearings are contained in a cartridge that features the ball bearings and inner and outer race as one unit. The outer race is a tight press-fit into the hub shell, while the axle contacts the inner race. These items are considered disposable, where old ones are tapped out and new cartridges pressed in place</li>\n<li><strong>Centrelock:</strong> a Shimano spline system for mounting a brake rotor onto the hub</li>\n<li><strong>Clincher:</strong> The most common type of tyre system on a road bike. Here a bead on the tyre locks with a lip on the rim. Non-tubeless clincher tyres use inner tubes to hold air</li>\n<li><strong>Cup and cone bearing:</strong> The alternative to cartridge bearing hubs is cup and cone. It’s most common on entry-level wheels and all those sold by Shimano. These feature loose ball bearings that run on a permanent outer bearing race, with a cone-shaped inner race that can be adjusted</li>\n<li><strong>Disc brake:</strong> Brake technology that’s now common in cycling that fixes a thin metal plate braking surface (rotor) at the hub with a caliper attached to the frame that clamps onto it to slow the bike down</li>\n<li><strong>Dish:</strong> The relative position of the rim to the hub. On nearly all frame designs, the rim must be perfectly centred over the hub</li>\n<li><strong>Double-wall rim:</strong> This refers to the internal cross-section of a rim. Where a single wall rim has one layer of material for the spokes to connect to and the tyre to sit on, a double wall rim adds an additional level of material separating the two. This additional layer creates a box type section, which greatly aids in rim stiffness and wheel durability</li>\n<li><strong>Eyelet</strong>: A reinforcing ring in the spoke hole of a rim. An eyeleted rim typically allows for greater spoke tension and therefore a more durable wheel. A rim that claims to feature double eyelets will have the eyelets travel through both walls of the rim (see double wall rim)</li>\n<li><strong>Freehub body:</strong> The mechanism on the rear wheel that allows a rider to coast or pedal backwards without resistance</li>\n<li><strong>Hub:</strong> Sitting at the centre of the wheel is the hub, which contains the axle, bearings and rear freehub and holds the spokes</li>\n<li><strong>Machined sidewall:</strong> A finishing process to a rim brake wheel after the rim is made, which helps ensure its braking faces are parallel and even</li>\n<li><strong>Nipple:</strong> The nipple is the nut of the spoke. Typically the nipple sits at the rim, though some wheel designs place the nipple at the hub</li>\n<li><strong>Open-tubular:</strong> A type of clincher tyre system that replicates the construction of a traditional cotton tubular, but in clincher form. Open tubulars differ slightly in their manufacturing technique, which is generally to a level similar to high-end tubulars</li>\n<li><strong>Quick-release:</strong> A tool-free mechanism for attaching a wheel to a bike. It consists of a threaded rod connected to a lever-actuated cam assembly. The rod slides through a hollow hub axle and a nut on the opposing side allows tension adjustment</li>\n<li><strong>Radial lacing</strong>: Where the spoke leaves the hub and meets the rim in a straight line. This is the easiest form of wheel building and results in the shortest length (lightest weight) spoke possible. This style is popular for rim brake front wheels, but does not resist torque appropriately for use on the driveside of a rear wheel or with disc brakes</li>\n<li><strong>Rim:</strong> The outward hoop of the wheel that holds the tyre and acts as a braking surface for rim brakes</li>\n<li><strong>Rim tape (AKA rim strip):</strong> Protective tape used to cover the multiple spoke holes in a rim. Without this, an inner tube would expand through the rim holes and puncture. Some top wheelsets from Shimano, Fulcrum, Mavic and others do not require rim tape. Tubeless setups often require tubeless-specific rim tape because the system must be made airtight, so make sure to check you have the correct tape for your tyres</li>\n<li><strong>Sealed bearing:</strong> Another name for cartridge bearing</li>\n<li><strong>Sleeve joint:</strong> A method by which an alloy rim is joined to form a circle. Sleeve joints are a form of rivet; they are cheaper to produce than a welded joint</li>\n<li><strong>Spoke:</strong> Wire rods that connect the hub to the rim. They can be made from steel, stainless steel (most common), titanium, aluminium or carbon fibre</li>\n<li><strong>Spoke flange:</strong> The section of the hub that the spokes attach to</li>\n<li><strong>Spoke gauge:</strong> This refers to the thickness of the spoke. Most common is ‘14G’, which commonly equates to a 2mm diameter, ‘15G’ is thinner at 1.8mm. Therefore, ‘straight gauge spokes’ feature a single diameter, whereas the most common double-butted spokes with a 2/1.8/2mm diameter across the length are sometimes referred to as ‘14/15G’</li>\n<li><strong>Three-cross:</strong> This refers to the lacing pattern of the spokes where each spoke crosses past another three times. This pattern is most common on 32 or higher spoked wheels</li>\n<li><strong>Thru-axle:</strong> A large axle that slides through a closed frame dropout and the hub, screwing into threads on the far side of the wheel, allowing for a stiffer and more secure wheel connection. Thru-axles are commonly used on disc brake road bikes</li>\n<li><strong>Trueness:</strong> This refers to how straight a rim runs, adjusted via spoke tension (hence the expression to ‘true’ a wheel)</li>\n<li><strong>Tubeless:</strong> An airtight clincher tyre system that uses a tight tyre fit, air pressure and tubeless sealant to hold the tyre in place. No inner tube is required. Tubeless wheels are backwards compatible with standard clincher tyres and tubes, but tubeless tyres require tubeless-specific rims</li>\n<li><strong>Tubular:</strong> A type of tyre, also known as a ‘tub’, a ‘single’ or a ‘sew-up’. The inner tube is stitched into a carcass that has tread on the outside and is glued to a concave rim</li>\n<li><strong>Tubular glue:</strong> A specific glue used to bond a tubular tyre with a tubular rim. There are different kinds of tubular glue for aluminium and carbon rims</li>\n<li><strong>Tubular tape:</strong> A substitute for tubular glue, it’s effectively a double-sided tape that’s cleaner and easier to apply than tubular glue – although some argue it’s not as good as glue</li>\n<li><strong>Two-cross:</strong> This refers to the lacing pattern of the spokes where each spoke crosses past another twice. It’s most common on wheels with 20-28 spoke counts</li>\n<li><strong>Valve hole:</strong> A hole in the rim for the tube/tubular/tubeless valve to fit through</li>\n<li><strong>Wear indicator:</strong> Grooves or small holes on a rim’s braking surface to show rim condition. When the grooves or holes become flush with the rest of the rim, replacement is advised</li>\n<li><strong>Welded joint:</strong> A method by which an alloy rim is joined to form a circle. Welded rims are typically more expensive than sleeve joints because this method results in a stronger and lighter connection</li>\n</ul>","author":"Simon von Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"8484f2c9612f35f7b5a18e5ebc6d42f3390215f134ea0186a9eaaab1946ca1d6","category":"Cycling"}
