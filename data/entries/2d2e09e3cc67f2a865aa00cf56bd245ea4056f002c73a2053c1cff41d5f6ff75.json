If you’re a longtime reader you know <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/weather+app\">I’m a nut for iPhone weather apps</a>. There are so many <em>great</em> ones for iOS, starting with Apple’s own. I just love how much creativity and originality there is in presentation, emphasis, and information design.</p>\n\n<p>Weather Up 3 stakes out two unique positions. The app itself presents a map-first design. No other weather app (that I’m aware of) goes map-first presentation-wise (which, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2024/02/29/ep-396\">as David Barnard explained on my podcast</a>, is expensive).</p>\n\n<p>But even more interesting is that Weather Up 3 is really widget-first — the app interface is secondary to the widget interface, which, for weather, I think is the right priority — and the widget design is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Information-dense</li>\n<li>Attractive</li>\n<li>Original</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Just a phenomenally good weather app, that you should definitely try.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/01/weather-up\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2d2e09e3cc67f2a865aa00cf56bd245ea4056f002c73a2053c1cff41d5f6ff75","category":"Tech"}
