Joining it is an new bronze anodized finish for their components, covering everything from chainrings to cockpit to brakes and more. They also have a new “downcountry” stem, plus a bottom bracket with better bearings. Here’s the deets…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hope Tech Carbon Cranks</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-tech-carbon-evo-MTB-cranks-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1923\" height=\"1126\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-tech-carbon-evo-MTB-cranks-1.jpg\" alt=\"hope carbon evo cranks shown disassembled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-tech-carbon-evo-MTB-cranks-1.jpg 1923w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-tech-carbon-evo-MTB-cranks-1-297x174.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-tech-carbon-evo-MTB-cranks-1-800x468.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-tech-carbon-evo-MTB-cranks-1-120x70.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-tech-carbon-evo-MTB-cranks-1-768x450.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-tech-carbon-evo-MTB-cranks-1-1536x899.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Hope carbon cranks borrow construction cues from their carbon handlebar and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021-hope-hb-130-gets-a-mullet-conversion-kit-boost-rear-end-new-factory-racing-spec/\">HB.130 trail</a> and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hope-hb-916-high-pivot-mtb/\">HB.916 enduro</a> mountain bike frames. This means T700 fibers underneath a 1K woven outer layer for abrasion resistance, all tuned to balance stiffness with ride quality. And like those other items, it’s made in their own factory in Barnoldswick, UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hope Carbon Evo cranks come in 155, 165, and 170-mm crank arm lengths. Hope went short on their crank arms in 2022 and haven’t looked back, so the longest they offer for these is 170mm. Their alloy RX road/gravel cranks are still available in 170/172.5/175, and the alloy Evo cranks still have a 175mm option, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-carbon-evo-crankarm-assembly.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-carbon-evo-crankarm-assembly.jpg\" alt=\"hope evo carbon crank arms in pieces\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-carbon-evo-crankarm-assembly.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-carbon-evo-crankarm-assembly-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-carbon-evo-crankarm-assembly-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-carbon-evo-crankarm-assembly-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-carbon-evo-crankarm-assembly-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-carbon-evo-crankarm-assembly-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-carbon-evo-crankarm-assembly-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has the same self-extracting mounting bolt from their carbon cranks, with 7075 aluminum 30mm spindles available in different lengths to fit different BB shell widths. Unlike their alloy cranks, which use a three-piece design with separate axle, these permanently fix the axle to the non-drive crank arm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool features include a foam core to damp vibrations and replaceable pedal thread inserts. Claimed weight is 422g for the 155mm crankset w/o chainring, 487g with 32t chainring. Their chainrings are sold separately in 28- to 36-tooth counts, with multiple offsets. Mix and match chainring offsets and spindle widths to accommodate whatever frame and rear axle spacing you have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP is $695 (€690 / £550, available April 1, 2024), and hardware is available in black, blue, red, silver, purple, orange, and the new…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bronze ano option &amp; new TR stem</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-TR-stem-Bronze.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1208\" height=\"806\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-TR-stem-Bronze.jpg\" alt=\"new hope TR stem\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-TR-stem-Bronze.jpg 1208w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-TR-stem-Bronze-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-TR-stem-Bronze-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-TR-stem-Bronze-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-TR-stem-Bronze-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hope-TR-stem-Bronze-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Hope TR stem replaces their AM model with a lighter, stiffer design. It matches the look of their Gravity stem, but is aimed at the trail and downcountry rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s available in 35/40/50mm lengths with a 35mm bar clamp, and 32/40/50mm for 31.8mm bars. It has 0º rise, a wide 56mm clamping area, and comes with stainless steel bolts. Weights from 123g to 150g, MSRP $135 (€135 / £105). Available March 1, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hpoe-tech-bronze-ano-color-MTB-components.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1086\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hpoe-tech-bronze-ano-color-MTB-components.jpg\" alt=\"new hope bronze anodized color for components\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hpoe-tech-bronze-ano-color-MTB-components.jpg 1620w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hpoe-tech-bronze-ano-color-MTB-components-297x199.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hpoe-tech-bronze-ano-color-MTB-components-800x536.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hpoe-tech-bronze-ano-color-MTB-components-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hpoe-tech-bronze-ano-color-MTB-components-768x515.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hpoe-tech-bronze-ano-color-MTB-components-1536x1030.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of their component lineup also gets the bronze color option, including hubs, brake hardware, brake rotor carriers, and pedals. Available March 1 for an indefinite period of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Hope PF41 bottom brackets</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/new-hope-bottombrackets-with-wider-sealed-bearings.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/new-hope-bottombrackets-with-wider-sealed-bearings.jpg\" alt=\"hope bottom bracket with wider sealed bearings\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/new-hope-bottombrackets-with-wider-sealed-bearings.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/new-hope-bottombrackets-with-wider-sealed-bearings-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/new-hope-bottombrackets-with-wider-sealed-bearings-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/new-hope-bottombrackets-with-wider-sealed-bearings-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/new-hope-bottombrackets-with-wider-sealed-bearings-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/new-hope-bottombrackets-with-wider-sealed-bearings-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hope’s prior press-fit bottom brackets used dual cartridge bearings on either side to improve durability when cramming a 30mm crank spindle inside a BB shell designed for 24mm cranks like Shimano’s. That worked, but they lacked enough seals and an inner sleeve to prevent moisture, dust, and dirt from creeping in from the inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new model use a wide new custom-designed Swiss bearing with full seals, further aided by end cap shields for the outside faces, and a single-piece inner sleeve to protect the inside faces. They’re also better able to accommodate slight frame misalignments, so they’ll roll smoother for longer no matter what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Available with internal sleeves to fit 86.5, 89.5, 92, 104.5, 107, and 121mm bottom bracket shell widths. Includes convertors to suit DUB (28.99mm) spindles, too. MSRP $114.00 (€113.00 / £90.00), available March 1, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com\" target=\"_blank\">HopeTech.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/hope-tech-carbon-cranks-bronze-color/\">Hope Goes for Bronze, Adds Carbon Fiber Crankset &amp; More</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"c204b13a7fdaefe217c77bc7270724bfedf3311470f9f23fbf9148148a5904e4","category":"Cycling"}
