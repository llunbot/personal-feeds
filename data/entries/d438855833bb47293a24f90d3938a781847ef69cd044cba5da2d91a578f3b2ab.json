Most cyclists will know that some helmet brands simply fit them better than others – it often depends if your head shape tends more towards round or oval. Fizik’s solution is to start with a pretty common 360° plastic retention system with dial adjust in the back – to fit heads from 52-61cm around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they take it to a new level with little red pins that attach this retention loop to the helmet shell. Use just the standard position 1 pin if you have a narrower head and the loop tightens against your head as you dial in the fit.   Position 2 holds that loop a bit further out, and Position 3  secures the loop all the way to the side of the helmet shell for improved comfort for riders with a ‘more round’ head shape. (I like #2 for the best fit, personally.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, there are still 4 vertical positions to adjust the rear occipital cradle, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Safety with MIPS Air Node </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_MIPS-Air-Node-inside.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_MIPS-Air-Node-inside.webp\" alt=\"All-new Fizik road, gravel &amp; MTB helmets, MIPS Air Node inside detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_MIPS-Air-Node-inside.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_MIPS-Air-Node-inside-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_MIPS-Air-Node-inside-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_MIPS-Air-Node-inside-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_MIPS-Air-Node-inside-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_MIPS-Air-Node-inside-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_MIPS-Air-Node-inside-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo/Cory Benson)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Industry-mandated safety standards are a minimum. But the three everyday Fizik cycling helmets all feature MIPS Air Node inside for additional protection when non-linear impact forces come into play. Air Node is the least intrusive MIPS solution yet – no yellow plastic liner inside. You might not even notice it if it weren’t for the yellow dot on the outside of the helmet. Combining each helmet’s padding with the classic MIPS slip layer, there’s no compromise in ventilation, but the helmet shell can still move independently of the rider’s head in a glancing blow to dissipate some of those rotational forces before they get to your brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_snap-in-rechargable-taillight.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_snap-in-rechargable-taillight.webp\" alt=\"All-new Fizik road, gravel &amp; MTB helmets, snap-on taillight detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_snap-in-rechargable-taillight.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_snap-in-rechargable-taillight-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_snap-in-rechargable-taillight-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_snap-in-rechargable-taillight-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fizik-helmets-launch-4-all-new-designs-for-road-gravel-and-mountain-bike_snap-in-rechargable-taillight-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo/Cory Benson)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Boosting everyday safety a bit more, each Kassis, Kudo &amp; Kudo Aero helmet includes a small snap-in rear light that pushes firmly and securely into place for improved visibility when sharing the road.
