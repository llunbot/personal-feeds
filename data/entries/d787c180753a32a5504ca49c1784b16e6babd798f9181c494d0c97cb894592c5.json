Given the realities of the supply chain and Google's relationship with Samsung, Google's foldables will probably look pretty similar to this.

We've seen <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/googles-foldable-phone-plans-include-two-devices-android-12-1-release/\">plenty of rumors</a> and Android source code pointing to Google going in that direction, plus the announcement of a foldable-focused Android release. Now, a recent <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/11/04/googles-pixel-foldable-coming-in-2022-cameras-will-be-a-step-down-from-pixel-6/\">9to5Google</a> report says that a Pixel foldable with a very familiar camera sensor is coming in 2022.</p>\n<p>Apparently, the latest Google Camera app has a device detection flag called \"isPixel2022Foldable.\" Believe it or not, the Google Camera app is a decent indicator of release dates, as it previously outed the Pixel 4 and 3a with flags like \"isPixel2019MidRange\" and \"isPixel2019.\"</p>\n<p>The software side of the Pixel Foldable plan is definitely happening. Google recently announced <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/android-12-is-so-last-week-meet-android-12l-now-in-developer-preview/\">Android 12L</a>, a mid-cycle update for Android that focuses on features for tablets and foldables. The Android Team's development <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/06/nexus-program-manager-says-nexus-devices-cant-ever-go-away/\">process</a> promises that new Android software and hardware will be developed together (which is why there have always been Nexus or Pixel devices). So with a big foldables release, it makes sense that a Pixel foldable is in the works. Android 12L is due out in March 2022, so that's probably the earliest any Pixel foldable will be released.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810606#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810606&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d787c180753a32a5504ca49c1784b16e6babd798f9181c494d0c97cb894592c5","category":"Tech"}
