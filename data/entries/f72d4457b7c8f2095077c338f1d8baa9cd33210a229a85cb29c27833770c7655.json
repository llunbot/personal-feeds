The National Advertising Division (NAD), part of the advertising industry's self-regulatory system run by BBB National Programs, ruled against Comcast after a challenge lodged by T-Mobile.</p>\n<p>In its decision <a href=\"https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/comcast-10g\">announced</a> Thursday, the NAD recommended that Comcast \"discontinue its '10G' claims\" or \"modify its advertising to (a) make clear that it is implementing improvements that will enable it to achieve '10G' and that it is aspirational or (b) use '10G' in a manner that is not false or misleading, consistent with this decision.\"</p>\n<p>Comcast plans to appeal the decision, so it won't make any changes to marketing immediately. If Comcast loses the appeal and agrees to change its practices, it would affect more than just a few ads because Comcast now calls its entire broadband network \"10G.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976276#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976276&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f72d4457b7c8f2095077c338f1d8baa9cd33210a229a85cb29c27833770c7655","category":"Tech"}
