When he’s not riding them he’s scouring scrap heaps for his next frame to upcycle. And when he’s not busy tinkering away in his workshop-cum-skatepark, you can probably find him pulling wheelies through the streets of Leuven, Belgium, with his band of merry youths.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Ah yes, Wheelie Wednesday! It’s great – we’ve been doing it for about three or four years. Everybody meets up at the workshop, then we eat something and go riding around the city on our back wheels. If any of the youngsters don’t have a bike to ride, they can take one from me.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bryce-gracey-no-22-bicycle-company\">Meet the maker: Bryce Gracey of No.22 Bicycle Company</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/starfish-bicycles\">Meet the maker: Tore Juncher Jørgensen of Starfish Bicycles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ichnu-cycles\">Meet the maker: Fabio Putzolu of Ichnu Cycles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>‘Usually the first stop is the skate shop to say hi to the guys there, then we’ll head to get some drinks for everyone. It’s a real nice thing. A lot of great young kids come along from all different backgrounds – it’s cool to see.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boucif occasionally puts his front wheel on the ground too. In fact, when we catch up over the phone, he’s currently part way through a transcontinental bikepacking trip from his native Belgium to Bilbao, Spain.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-02-646x970.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Boucif\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-02-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-02-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-02-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-02-1363x2048.jpg 1363w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-02-750x1127.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-02-1140x1713.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Driss Boucif built this bike for the 2023 Bespoked show, and hosting a stall as part Sram’s Inclusivity Scholarship gave him access to some top-end components. </figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘It’s heavy, but we’re enjoying it,’ he laughs. ‘We just reached France, which was our goal for the day. But yeah, it was bad rain and we were all a bit sick too. Still, we made it in the end.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boucif’s bike of choice for the trip is naturally one of his own creations. He has been building frames since his teenage years after initially studying to fix mopeds. Now he runs a workshop out of Leuven’s first indoor skatepark – a vision he helped his friends bring to life using his practical skills. Here Boucif makes all manner of bicycles, but it’s his recycled step-through frames for which he is best known.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I found a technique to rework a classic women’s frame,’ Boucif explains. ‘It involves cutting out the top tube, flipping it and welding it back in.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Boucif\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-03-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-03-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-03-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-03-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I started working this way rather than building frames from scratch because I really didn’t have another option. Framebuilding isn’t accessible for a young chap with no money, and this way it doesn’t have to be that expensive. Most of the frames I get either from scrap yards or as donations from my clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Some of them are a good 40 years old, but being plain-gauge steel they age pretty well. I actually appreciate the simplicity of working this way now. It’s functional too, because the whole frame basically works like a giant leaf spring.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/clickable-subs-promo6-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Hump-backed bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike pictured is perhaps the most polished version of Boucif’s signature upcycled step-through frames. It’s one he built specially for Bespoked 2023, where he hosted a stall as part of Sram’s Inclusivity Scholarship. It’s an initiative designed to promote diversity at the event, offering participants the opportunity to display their work and a chance to build their show bikes out with top-end componentry.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Boucif\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-04-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘We wanted to do something really special as it was a special opportunity,’ says Boucif. ‘We had a meeting about parts, and at first I just asked for simple stuff like maybe some friction shifters and a seven-speed, but they were like, “No, no, no, we’re going to kit you out properly.” They offered me the rainbow-drip chain too, so obviously I took that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We got all these parts and I was envisioning making a bike for racing through the city. I was thinking nice big slick tyres and stuff like that. We ended up going with 35mm at the front and 40mm at the back. I like to do it this way because generally the back tyre takes more weight, and I think it makes things look a little sharper overall. I also wanted to go with nice narrow bars for zipping through tight city streets and alleys.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-05-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Boucif\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-05-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-05-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-05-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-05-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-05-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-05-1140x1709.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/meet-the-maker-boucif-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Then I got looking for a worthy frame.

I don’t write myself, but I’m a graffiti dealer. It’s actually really good paint. I mean, it’s not like powder coat but it does the job well. It goes on easy and when it scratches it’s very easy to touch up. It’s almost easier to touch it up than to clean it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fancy a frame for yourself? The good news is Boucif likes to keep his rates affordable.
