Its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/comcast-hemorrhaging-subscribers-to-bundle-apple-tv-netflix-peacock-cable/\">previously announced bundle</a> of Netflix, Peacock, and Apple TV+, only to Comcast/Xfinity cable or broadband subscribers, will cost $15 per month. It's a big discount on paper, but the fine print needs reading.</p>\n<p>The \"<a href=\"https://www.xfinity.com/learn/digital-cable-tv/streaming-services\">StreamSaver\" bundle</a> is considered a \"companion to broadband,\" Comcast's CEO David Watson said at a conference today, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/comcast-prices-peacock-netflix-apple-tv-streaming-bundle-15-month-2024-05-21/\">according to Reuters</a>.

The service is due out May 29 in the US.</p>\n<p>Take note that Comcast's bundle gives you Netflix's \"<a href=\"https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926\">Standard with ads</a>\" plan (which also locks you in at \"Full HD\" resolution and two devices), Peacock's \"<a href=\"https://www.peacocktv.com/\">Premium</a>\" (which also has ads), and Apple TV+, which has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/24/23614183/apple-tv-plus-ads-ad-supportied-tier-hire\">made some recent moves</a> toward an advertising infusion. The things that people liked about streaming—being able to pick and choose TV and movie catalogs, pay to avoid advertisements, and not be beholden to their cable company for entertainment—are effectively countered by StreamSaver. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/comcast-hemorrhaging-subscribers-to-bundle-apple-tv-netflix-peacock-cable/\">The lines get blurrier</a>, and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/08/the-tv-streaming-apps-broke-their-promises-and-now-theyre-jacking-the-price/2/\">prices go up</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025975#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025975&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2c5dd790932d37a3f8e2222da981778b80920411e89745115a6f48fcf8c49ae1","category":"Tech"}
