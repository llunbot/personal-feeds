{"title":"Another firmware update for the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro fixes unknown bugs","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2133398/2nd-gen-airpods-pro-firmware-update-6b32-bug-fixes.html","date":1699566947000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has updated the 2nd-generation AirPods Pro firmware to 6B32, a few weeks after the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110471/airpods-pro-bugfix-firmware-6a305-comes-just-a-week-after-the-last-one.html\">6A305</a> update. According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213317&amp;xcust=1-1-2133398-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple’s support page</a>, this update offers “Bug fixes and other improvements,” which is the boilerplate language Apple uses even when there <em>aren’t</em> “other improvements.” The firmware applies to both the original Lightning version of the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro and the newer USB-C model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 6A301 update, released in September, added Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, and Personalized Volume for users with iOS 17 or macOS Sonoma. It was followed by 6A303 and 6A305 in rapid succession—the new features still seem to have a few kinks to iron out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see what firmware version your AirPods are running, connect them to your iPhone and perform the following steps: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Open Settings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select your connected AirPods (near the top).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scroll down past all the options to the <em>About</em> section.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Look at the <em>Version</em> line.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also find this information in <em>General</em> &gt; <em>About</em> &gt; <em>AirPods Pro</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no reliable way to force your AirPods Pro to update. Rather, they tend to update when connected to an iPhone that is online but are not in use. The best you can do is connect them (perhaps play some music for a few seconds to ensure they’re connected), then close the case with the earbuds in, put them on a charger, and keep them within range of your iPhone. It can take hours or even days to get the latest firmware.</p>\n\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6dd533e842766f219f44f0b3630c8d09f088765e5554e15eaeb6ddf4e46e9db3","category":"Apple"}
