For example, Apple Intelligence tools such as the Image Playground app or Writing Tools create content based on input the user provides. According to Malwarebytes, generative AI has not had a significant impact on malware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the next iteration of AI is what <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2024/12/what-is-agentic-ai-and-how-will-it-change-work\">experts</a> call <em>agentic AI</em>, which can act autonomously to solve complex, multi-tiered problems. According to Malwarebytes, “Big game ransomware requires a lot of human labor,” and a lot of that labor can be addressed with agentic AI by threat agents. “Agentic AI could be used to scale up the number and speed of attacks,” according to the report. Agentic AI can also be used to defend against malware attacks through autonomous agents that can proactively check for vulnerabilities, monitor systems, and ensure that security patches are put into place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malwarebytes recommends that organizations “operate their security as efficiently as possible” to protect against attacks, which includes active monitoring of security consoles and acting on alerts immediately. Automated tools can be used to install security patches quickly and efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malwarebyte’s report is targeted at IT professionals and the “big game” attacks the report covers involve corporations. The report also states that 2024 was the worst year ever for known ransomware attacks, which rose 13 percent. The U.S. saw a majority of the reported attacks, and two-thirds of the attacks were targeted at the manufacturing sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to protect yourself as an individual user from malware is to avoid downloading software from repositories such as GitHub and other download sites. Apple has vetted software in the Mac App Store and is the safest way to get apps. If you prefer not to patronize the Mac App Store, then buy software directly from the developer and their website. If you insist on using cracked software, you will always risk malware exposure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple releases security patches through OS updates, so installing them as soon as possible is important.
