Keep reading to learn why the alternative authentication method is the most secure method available and what you need to do to set it up.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/ios-16-3-security-keys-info.jpg\" alt width=\"3200\" height=\"1800\" />\r<br />\n<h2>What Are Security Keys?</h2>\r<br />\nWith the release of iOS 16.3, iPadOS 16.3, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/\">macOS Ventura</a> 13.2, Apple introduced support for security keys, or physical devices that can verify your ‌Apple ID‌ instead of a passcode. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple designed the feature for people who require additional protection from targeted attacks, such as phishing or social engineering scams. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe extra protection that security keys provide means that if someone had your ‌Apple ID‌ and your password, they still would not be able to access your account without your physical security key, which replaces the traditional verification code provided by two-factor authentication.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>How Do Security Keys Work?</h2>\r<br />\nWith a security key enabled, signing into an ‌Apple ID‌ requires entering your account's password and then using a security key to complete the two-factor authentication process, instead of the traditional six-digit verification code that is sent to another Apple device signed into the same account. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Why It's Worth Using Security Keys</h2>\r<br />\nIt's worth noting from the outset that using physical security keys puts the onus on you to be careful not to lose them, otherwise you could permanently lose access to your Apple account. This is why Apple requires users to set up at least two security keys, and supports up to six in total.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/security-keys.jpg\" alt width=\"1912\" height=\"1250\" />\r<br />\nHaving two physical security keys set up means you can keep them in more than one safe place. For example, you could keep one at home and one in your workplace, or you could keep one with you when traveling while the other one remains safe at home. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOnce you have security keys set up, you can use them to sign in with your ‌Apple ID‌ on a new device or on the web, reset your ‌Apple ID‌ password, and add additional security keys or remove them from your account. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>What You Can't Do With Security Keys</h2>\r<br />\nThere are a few things worth noting that you can't do with security keys. \r<br />\n<ul><li>You can't use them to sign in to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> for Windows.</li>\r<br />\n<li>You can't sign in to older devices that can't be updated to a software version that supports security keys.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Security keys don't support child accounts and Managed Apple IDs.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Apple Watches that are paired with a family member's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> aren't supported.</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Security Keys Worth Considering</h2>\r<br />\nMost security keys look similar to a typical USB thumb drive, with some options available with NFC for wireless use and others equipped with Lightning, USB-C, and/or USB-A ports for direct connectivity with iPhones, iPads, and Macs. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are many options on the market when buying security keys, but the main things to consider when choosing one are that it is FIDO Certified and that it has a connector that works with your Apple devices.
