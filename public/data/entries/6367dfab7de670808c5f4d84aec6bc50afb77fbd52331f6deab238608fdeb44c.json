However, he said the chips these models will use is a \"big remaining question.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/MacBook-Air-Multiple-Sizes-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nGurman said it is \"plausible\" that at least the next 13-inch MacBook Air will be equipped with the as-yet-unannounced M3 chip, which will reportedly be manufactured based on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/tsmc-3nm-mass-production-begins/\">TSMC's latest 3nm process</a> for improved performance. The current 13-inch model was released in July 2022 and is powered by the M2 chip, which is based on a 5nm process.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman did not reveal if the 15-inch MacBook Air will also be equipped with the M3 chip. He said a 15-inch model with an M2 chip \"may still excite consumers,\" but would \"quickly become outdated\" given the M3 chip is on the horizon. Last month, Taiwanese supply chain publication <em>DigiTimes</em> claimed the 15-inch MacBook Air <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/15/15-inch-macbook-air-m2-chip-rumor/\">will be equipped with the M2 chip</a>, but the website has a mediocre track record with Apple rumors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's supply chain <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/13/15-inch-macbook-air-display-production/\">started production of display panels</a> for a new 15.5-inch MacBook Air in February, according to display industry analyst Ross Young, who has a solid track record with display-related rumors. This model would be the largest-ever MacBook Air, as the notebook has only ever been offered in 13-inch and 11-inch sizes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll in all, there is still chip uncertainty surrounding the new MacBook Air models, but it is noteworthy that Gurman expects both 13-inch and 15-inch models to be released by the summer. He also continues to expect a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/11/new-mac-pro-macos-13-3/\">new Mac Pro desktop tower with an M2 Ultra chip</a> and the same design as the 2019 model to launch by the summer, and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/05/new-imac-advanced-development/\">updated 24-inch iMac</a> to be released in the second half of this year at the earliest.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/15-inch-macbook-air/\">15-Inch MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/05/new-macbook-airs-by-summer-gurman/\">Gurman: New 13-Inch and 15-Inch MacBook Airs Likely to Launch by Summer</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-new-13-inch-and-15-inch-macbook-airs-likely-to-launch-by-summer.2382814/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6367dfab7de670808c5f4d84aec6bc50afb77fbd52331f6deab238608fdeb44c","category":"Apple"}
