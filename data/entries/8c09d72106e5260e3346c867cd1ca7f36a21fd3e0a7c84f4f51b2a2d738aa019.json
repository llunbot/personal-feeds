Investing in a quality winter cycling jacket – one you know will protect you against wind and rain – can make the difference between staying indoors and venturing out.</p>\n<p>For many riders, that means battling sub-zero temperatures, compounded by biting winds, and trying to stave off rain showers.</p>\n<p>Knowing <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-layering-up-for-winter-cycling/\">how to layer up</a> is key to successful winter riding. Besides quality bib-longs, a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-base-layers/\">baselayer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-winter-cycling-gloves/\">winter cycling gloves</a> and a set of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-overshoes/\">overshoes</a>, a good jacket is essential if you live somewhere with a cold (and wet) climate.</p>\n<p>When it comes to buying one of the best winter cycling jackets, one of the first things to consider is whether you need a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/softshell-vs-hardshell-jackets/\">hardshell or softshell jacket</a>.</p>\n<p>Hardshell jackets are typically designed to keep the elements out so, if you’re after something to wear in an outright downpour, read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-waterproof-jackets-for-cyclists/\">best waterproof jackets for cyclists</a>.</p>\n<p>Many winter cycling jackets, however, use a softshell fabric to deflect those chilly blasts of air, and most will feature a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-rejuvenate-your-waterproof-cycling-gear/\">durable water-resistant coating</a> to keep showers at bay, even if they’re not completely waterproof.</p>\n<p>A softshell cycling jacket will typically be more breathable than a hardshell jacket, so the intention here is to stay comfortable in a wide range of conditions.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, here’s our round-up of the best winter cycling jackets, as tried and tested by the BikeRadar team.</p>\n<p>Below the best list is our buyer’s guide to winter cycling jackets. It will help you know what to look for in a quality winter jacket and understand the various features and tech terms used by brands.</p>\n<h2>Best winter cycling jackets in 2023</h2>\n<h3>Castelli Alpha RoS 2 Light Jacket</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This could be the only jacket you need for winter riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£250 / $290 / AU$399 / €250 as tested</li>\n<li>Excellent in the wind and rain</li>\n<li>Pricey performance</li>\n</ul><p>The Castelli Alpha RoS 2 Light Jacket’s winter prowess comes from wind- and water-busting Gore-Tex Infinium fabric.</p>\n<p>Despite its typically Castelli sporty sizing, it has a rain-proof phone pocket besides three open back pockets. The internal vest allows you to remove the outer layer should your or the outside temperature rise.</p>\n<p>Although Castelli calls it a ‘light’ jacket, the Alpha Ros 2 provided insulation below its recommended 7-15°C range. If needed, you can add a jersey over a baselayer beneath.</p>\n<p>The RRP is high, but there are deals to be had. It’ll save you buying a packable winter rainproof and the fabric proved durable through months of tough on- and off-road testing.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/jackets-and-vests/jackets/castelli-alpha-ros-2-light-jacket-review/\">Read our full Castelli Alpha Ros 2 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Castelli Alpha Ultimate Insulated Jacket</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Alpha Ultimate could be the one jacket to rule them all.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£380 / $449.99 / €349.95 / AU$600 as tested</li>\n<li>Excellent in all conditions</li>\n<li>One of the most expensive jackets</li>\n</ul><p>The Castelli Alpha Ultimate Insulated jacket is the brand’s top-of-the-range winter jacket, targeting a wide temperature range of <span>-5</span><span>°C to 12°C. </span></p>\n<p>The Ultimate Insulated variant departs from the Gore-Tex Infinium found on the Alpha RoS 2 and Alpha RoS 2 Light, opting for Polartec fabrics instead.

We’ve also included a full buyer’s guide with more information at the end of the article.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Being seen</strong>: The colour scheme of jackets has become less noir and more safety-centric, but also look for added hi-vis and reflective elements, often found on the hem, seams and/or pockets.</li>\n<li><strong>Water-resistant</strong>: A good windproof jacket should prevent water ingress, but the favourable breathability compared to a hardshell jacket means full waterproofing is unlikely.</li>\n<li><strong>Sleeves</strong>: Ensure these are long and secure enough to prevent draughts entering. The cuffs should sit neatly alongside your bike gloves but not be too tight if you want to read a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-watch/\">sports watch</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Pockets</strong>: Rear pockets can be open, zipped or both. Ideally, one will be waterproof. The key is that they’re accessible, especially if they contain on-the-fly essentials. A zipped chest pocket is also welcome.</li>\n<li><strong>Dropped tail</strong>: Bike jackets feature a slightly longer rear to prevent draughts, especially when you’re down on the drops.

Riders who are solely covering short distances, for example when <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-to-work-guide/\">cycling to work</a>, can probably get away with a looser cut.</p>\n<p>But, for endurance rides, you should minimise flapping in the wind for both warmth and aerodynamic reasons, so we’d advise a close and slim fit.</p>\n<p>That fit, however, needs to be large enough to squeeze a baselayer and, if necessary, a mid-layer underneath.</p>\n<p>We realise this is sometimes easier said than done, which is why trying before you buy is recommended (as is a decent returns policy), especially as sizing can vary markedly between the manufacturers.</p>\n<p>Other things to look for are the type and location of the pockets, from zipped to internal and rear.</p>\n<p>The texture of the collar is also important, as is the effectiveness of the front zipper and the ability to adjust it up or down with one hand while on the move.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A high collar that can be unzipped is a great feature.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Aesthetics also play a role, because, if you’re anything like us, you’ll end up wearing yours on the school run and to work.</p>\n<p>Finally, fabric choice is key, to find the right balance between waterproofing and breathability, and the small details, such as collars, cuffs and pockets, can make all the difference to the end product.</p>\n<p>That’s the basics covered. Now let’s take a closer look at the key features to consider when buying a winter cycling jacket.</p>\n<h3>Complexity</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> GoreTex fabric helps a jacket perform in an array of conditions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A good winter cycling jacket needs to keep out the cold without making you overheat, and it should prevent rain from getting in but not stop sweat evaporating out. It’s a tricky proposition, even with the advent of today’s advanced fabrics.</p>\n<p>Suffice to say, coming up with a suitable solution means a winter bike jacket is as high-tech as any other cycling clothing item. Scratch beneath the surface and you quickly find yourself in a world of hydrophilic polyurethane coatings and ePTFE membranes with billions of micropores per square inch.</p>\n<p>But why do they need to be so complex when all they’re doing is being a barrier between you and the elements? The answer to that is you, or more specifically, the heat and sweat you generate while riding.</p>\n<p>Cold and wet weather can not only make you miserable, it can affect your performance. But so can getting too hot and soaking in sweat, which means a winter cycling jacket and the fabrics it’s made from need to work like an elaborate one-way system.</p>\n<p>They need to be porous and gas permeable from the inside out, to allow heat build-up to escape, but non-porous and impermeable from the outside in, to keep rain at bay.</p>\n<h3>Breathability</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Chest vents can be zipped down to freshen up.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Waterproofing and water-resistant treatments have often been the enemy of breathability in a cycling jacket, but that’s improved recently and winter jackets are no longer the glorified bin bags of old. But where have the technological leaps been made?</p>\n<p>“This is mainly through the addition of the DWR (durable water-repellent coating), which allows the surface fabric and the membrane to perform at their best by not letting the rain water ‘wet out’ the jacket and clog up the air permeability,” states Amy Spencer, design and development manager for Altura.</p>\n<p>“This membrane also has a breathability rating – how much air it will let escape. This is given a rating of 5k, 10k, 15k or 20k [with 20K being the most effective].</p>\n<p>“To ensure the breathability of the membrane performs efficiently, we also add a DWR to the face side (outside) of the fabric, which helps the rain droplets bead and fall from the jacket so they don’t penetrate the top layer of fabric and stop the jacket being as breathable.”</p>\n<h3>Pockets</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A zipped back pocket is for items you won’t take out often.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Cash, card, keys, phone, jelly babies, peanut butter sandwich, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-multi-tool/\">multi-tool</a>, spare <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-pump/\">pump</a>, banana, flapjack… if you’re anything like us, your pockets will be bulging when you exit the house before a long winter ride.</p>\n<p>Happily, most winter cycling jackets can accommodate moving buffets, but increasingly important for us is a zipped and waterproof pocket that’s big enough to stash a smartphone.</p>\n<p>A waterproof phone case is a smart addition for added protection and peace of mind, but it’s worth messaging the brand’s online customer support if you’re worried that your mobile – hello the iPhone 12 Pro Max – may be too big as a pocket companion.</p>\n<h3>Waterproofing</h3>\n<p>The key remit of a softshell cycling jacket is to provide warmth and windproofing, but there’s also water-resistant tech at play.</p>\n<p>Most winter cycling jackets will survive a shower, but many lack the fully waterproofing capabilities of a hardshell jacket.</p>\n<p>Just where does the extra rain-thwarting element come from in the more spring and autumn-friendly hardshell?</p>\n<p>“For a jacket to be fully waterproof, the fabric must have a membrane, described as a 2, 2.5, or 3-layer construction,” says Spencer. “The membrane makes the jacket waterproof by creating a barrier under the surface fabric.</p>\n<p>“This is the part of the fabric that determines the hydrostatic head rating (waterproof rating) of 5k, 10k, 15k or 20k [as with the breathability rating, the higher the number, the more effective the waterproofing].”</p>\n<p>Waterproof jackets are also made like a non-waterproof jacket by stitching panels together, Spencer adds. As the needle punches holes in the membrane, sacrificing waterproofing, many brands then add taping to the seams to provide an additional layer of protection.</p>\n<h3>Life cycle</h3>\n<p>Winter cycling jackets can be delicate pieces of kit, especially with materials having to balance the demands of waterproof and breathablity.</p>\n<p>While you can <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-rejuvenate-your-waterproof-cycling-gear/\">reproof a jacket</a> to reinstate some of its DWR protection, following the recommended washing instructions will not only preserve your jacket’s lifespan and save you pennies, but will help lower your ecological footprint.</p>\n<p>That heightened <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/trek-cycling-envrionmental-impact-report/\">environmental awareness</a> is shown in the lack of plastic packaging many jackets now arrive in, and also in some of the material choices on display. It’s a movement that’ll only intensify, believes Spencer.</p>\n<p>“Within five years, I’d like to see more fabrics that are sustainably sourced without compromising on the level of performance. As a rider, you need to feel comfortable that you’re protected from the elements, as well as buying a product where its whole life cycle has been considered.”</p>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"8c09d72106e5260e3346c867cd1ca7f36a21fd3e0a7c84f4f51b2a2d738aa019","category":"Cycling"}
