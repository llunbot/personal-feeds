I’d worked in the mainstream bike industry previously, but it seemed right to build it myself, rather than lean on a friend for a carbon wonder bike. The bike got some attention, and an overseas customer reached out for something similar. He wanted a 27.5″ rear wheel and a tight rear center to maintain a lively ride, and also wanted the trussed swingarm from the previous bike. I’d made the original bike swingarm a truss to solve an interference problem, but for this bike, it’s much more of an aesthetic choice, and paired with the trussed upper link, is an undeniable visual focal point.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-52.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-52.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-52.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-52.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The customer wanted a bike that was more playful than recent suspension platforms, which more and more completely isolated the rider from the terrain. While that might be faster in a race setting, it doesn’t lend itself to using the natural undulations as features to play with. Once we came up with a good idea of what he wanted and I could provide, I talked at great length with Evan Turpen of <a href=\"https://contrabikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Contra Bikes</a>, a friend and neighbor with legit full-sus bona fides, who’d helped me out with the kinematics on the Hocus Pocus. He had some ideas kicking around in his head – he always does! – so we came up with some expectations and compromises, and he came up with all the kinematics for the design.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-18.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The name “Mystery Spot” is from Santa Cruz’s very own world-famous old-timey roadside attraction, and is a play on all the moving (virtual) pivot location buzzwords. And… credit to where credit is due, it was coined by Steven at SimWorks. He’s obviously some kind of marketing genius with gems like that.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This bike was built almost entirely as a backup for the commissioned bike, as any late-stage mistake could have rendered the previous months’ effort a total waste. Fortunately, I somehow managed to hold it all together, and both bikes came out as intended.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-10.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-10.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-21.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-21.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-21.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-21.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-31.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-31.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-31.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-31.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>No one was more surprised than I! HA! While I really enjoy digging into the details of all the bikes I build, sometimes it’s pretty fun/challenging/maddening/rewarding to stand back and start a project, truly from ground zero. Definitely no phoning it in.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-53.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-53.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-53.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Black-Cat-Mystery-Spot-Full-Suspension-53.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Every bike (and everything in life, it seems) is a spec list that doubles as a list of compromises. To get one thing, you give up another. No Free Lunches(!), and this bike is no different. Being made of a lot of steel tubes, it certainly is not as light as a carbon wonder bike, but that’s ok. The metrics used to judge things are different for different people. No matter what random numbers it’s judged by, there certainly won’t be two of these at the trailhead.</p>\n<p>This is not by any means a production bike, and one-off bikes lack the economy of scale that allows modern engineering marvels to be affordable. As such, it’s not.</p>\n<p>This bike is up for grabs, and I’m always interested in future ground-up projects, <a href=\"https://www.blackcatbicycles.com/makecontact\" target=\"_blank\">so drop a line if you are too</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Many thanks to Todd for sharing his thoughts on the Mystery Spot MX Full Suspension.
