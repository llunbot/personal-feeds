I feel good here. That made it an easy and natural choice to stay longer with the team.”</p><p>A talented all-rounder, the 24-year-old Dane turned pro with Jumbo-Visma in 2019 after collecting some strong under-23 results that included a prologue win at the Baby Giro. In his first season at the WorldTour level, he took a WorldTour victory on stage 6 of the Tour of Poland, and rode to second overall at the Tour of Denmark. He enjoyed a particularly impressive start to his 2021 campaign, winning a stage at the UAE Tour and two stages and the overall at the Settimana Internazionale Coppi e Bartali and taking runner-up honors at the Itzulia Basque Country, before heading into the Tour as a key lieutenant for Primož Roglič.</p><p>Roglič, however, crashed on the third stage of the Tour and later pulled out of the race. Jumbo-Visma shifted its focus, with Vingegaard taking over as team leader, and the rising star impressed over the remainder of the race. Nabbing third-place finishes in both time trials and runner-up honors on the last two high-mountain stages, Vingegaard ultimately rode to second overall in the race, giving Jumbo-Visma a Tour runner-up for a second straight year.</p><p>Looking ahead, Vingegaard figures to be a key player in Jumbo-Visma’s Grand Tour plans at least through the 2024 season.</p><p>“Jonas has been riding for this team for three years now. We work together every day to become better,” said sport director Merijn Zeeman. “It is great to see a talent develop and grow within the team. We are confident that we will continue to achieve great performances together.”</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"c46f911c60d9193b6f4da17a219992bf221e007c8e233d077447aace225c93d9","category":"Cycling"}
