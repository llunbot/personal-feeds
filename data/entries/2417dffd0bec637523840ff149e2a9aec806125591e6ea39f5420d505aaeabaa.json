The ‌Apple TV‌ also comes with a custom EE-branded remote including a special TV guide button and channel rockers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe EE TV boxes offer a similar hub that combines live broadcast TV, access to UK catch-up and on demand apps, and the ability to buy and rent content, but they lack access to the other services that ‌Apple TV‌ typically provides. Those new to EE TV are also eligible to six months of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a> for free. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ee-apple-tv-remote.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nAll 24-month contracts come with live free-to-air channels and catchup. The platform also offers a range of additional services and premium channel packages, priced between £4.99 and £76, with customers able to flexibly add or remove packages from month to month. EE also offers subscribers a bonus EE TV Box Mini for \"free multi-room TV.\" For more information, see the <a href=\"https://ee.co.uk/tv/apple-tv-4k\">EE website</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, Ross!)</em><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/uk-ee-tv-platform-custom-apple-tv-4k/\">UK's EE TV Platform Launches With Customized Apple TV 4K</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uks-ee-tv-platform-launches-with-customized-apple-tv-4k.2412950/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2417dffd0bec637523840ff149e2a9aec806125591e6ea39f5420d505aaeabaa","category":"Apple"}
