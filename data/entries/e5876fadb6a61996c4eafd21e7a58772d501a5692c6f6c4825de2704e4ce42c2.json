[credit:\n                        YouTube/Apple TV+                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>Apple TV+ has dropped the official trailer for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finch_(film)\"><em>Finch</em></a>, its forthcoming sci-fi film starring Tom Hanks as a robotics engineer who survives an apocalyptic solar flare, then goes on a trek to mountain safety with his trusty dog and robot sidekick. That is so Tom Hanks, amirite? Yes, this is a real movie, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eeberquist/status/1438506654090219525\">not a gag</a>. Based on the trailer—carefully tailored to push all the requisite emotional buttons—the film looks like a strange mix of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_Away\"><em>Cast Away</em></a>, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E\">WALL-E</a></em>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappie_(film)\"><em>Chappie</em></a>. In the right hands, that unlikely mix just might work.</p>\n<p>The title was <em>BIOS</em> when the film was originally announced in 2017. The global pandemic put the planned 2020 theatrical release on hold indefinitely, and Universal Pictures eventually sold the rights to Apple TV, which changed the title to <em>Finch.</em> There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. The film is directed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Sapochnik\">Miguel Sapochnik</a>, the mastermind behind several big, battle-centric episodes of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/its-reunions-tensions-galore-as-forces-converge-on-winterfell-in-got-final-bow/\"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, including \"Hardhome,\" \"The Battle of the Bastards,\" \"The Long Night,\" and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/here-is-our-super-spoiler-y-review-of-the-game-of-thrones-series-finale/\">hugely controversial</a> (because of a favorite character's heel turn) \"The Bells.\" The spec script by Craig Luck and Ivor Powell <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/554992/2017-black-list/\">made 2017's \"Black List\"</a> of favorite unproduced screenplays. And you've got the world's most likable everyman (Hanks) in the lead role.</p>\n<p>Per the official synopsis:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796691#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796691&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e5876fadb6a61996c4eafd21e7a58772d501a5692c6f6c4825de2704e4ce42c2","category":"Tech"}
