The Ultra version of the Apple Watch, the Max version of the AirPods, the non-mini HomePod, and the Pro versions of everything else. The problem is that customers generally feel the opposite—and nowhere is this truer than in the tablet market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surely some creative professionals use an iPad Pro for their work. The iPad Air has its fans too, and even the iPad mini is likely to shift some units after its (disappointingly minor) update last week. However, the vast majority of iPad users go for the standard model. Because of the low price, and because the way they use their tablet doesn’t require a super-fast processor or a high-end screen. For most people, the decision is a no-brainer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the disproportionate popularity of the vanilla iPad, it feels odd that Apple has this year unveiled updated versions of every model except that one. In the spring we got a new Pro and Air; in the fall a new mini; but there’s no sign of the 11th-gen iPad and it’s starting to look like we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2491817/were-probably-not-getting-an-11th-gen-ipad-this-year.html\">won’t get one before the end of 2024</a>. (In his weekly Power On newsletter, Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-20/apple-s-latest-ipad-mini-highlights-ai-advantage-sonos-considers-new-headphones-m2hkz4mn\">reported</a> that the entry-level iPad will “probably get updated later” in 2025.) But <em>that’s</em> the iPad people want! It would be like Marvel announcing that it isn’t going to make any more Spider-Man movies so it can focus properly on Howard the Duck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose from a strategic point of view, based on the upsell mentality I outlined in the first paragraph, it makes a certain amount of sense. By dropping the price of the 10th-gen iPad Apple keeps the loyalty of customers who prioritize value above all else, but by refusing to bump its specs the company can nudge everyone else towards the iPad Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it still feels dangerous for Apple to ignore its most popular and important iPad because, like a pub owner getting rid of the dartboard, this risks alienating the core of the user base. Owners of the standard iPad may not update their machines very often, because having the latest specs isn’t necessary for checking your emails on the sofa. But when they <em>do</em> decide that it’s time to look for a new model, how are they going to feel about the state of the range right now? Offered the choice of spending far more than they planned to, or getting an iPad that was last updated in 2022 and is likely to be replaced in the near future, some will decide not to bother, and others will start to ask their grandchildren if Samsung makes iPads. Neither is a good outcome for one of Apple Park’s most beleaguered departments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s before we get to Apple Intelligence. It’s debatable how useful this will prove to be particularly in the short-term learning phase (a stage of product development that users of Apple Maps in 2012 will remember with little fondness). But it’s getting a lot of media attention, which means customer interest. And again, we have to ask which is more likely: A customer finds out the standard iPad doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, and happily spends an extra $250 on an iPad Air? Or a customer finds out the standard iPad doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, and walks sighing out of the store? It could lead to upsell, but it could also lead to no-sale… not to mention causing Apple to miss out on precious training data from a huge chunk of iPad users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A risky business, then. Although it may be a risk Apple feels it’s worth taking, because the iPad range at the moment simply isn’t earning its keep. (iPad revenue went up for a quarter after the company finally released some new models earlier this year, but the signs are that it’s about to go down again.) Customers may want to buy a cheap iPad once every five years, but there’s no mileage, or at least very little revenue, in catering to that market. Apple may feel that it’s worth losing those customers if it means more sales of the higher-margin versions of the iPad. Because sometimes you need to get rid of the dartboard to bring in a higher-spending clientele.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Welcome to our weekly Apple Breakfast column, which includes all the Apple news you missed last week in a handy bite-sized roundup.
