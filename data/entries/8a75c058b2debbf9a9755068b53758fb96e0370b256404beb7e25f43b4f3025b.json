Unfortunately, this past year has been much more middling than miraculous for Apple’s AI, with the platform failing to impress in the ways we were hoping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means there are a lot of ways Apple Intelligence could be improved in the future. From improved automation to more powerful editing tools and beyond, Apple’s AI foundation opens up a world of possibilities for bringing new smart tools to our Apple devices. Here are 10 of the top features we’d love to see in the next version of Apple Intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Intelligence 2.0: Fast improvements</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Image generation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s Image Playground app is a fun way to quickly create quirky images, but it’s still very limited and rudimentary, especially when you compare it to rival AI generators such as Stable Diffusion and GPT-4o Image Generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, Apple needs to fix those persistent bugbears that seem to afflict almost all AI generators, things like freakishly inaccurate hands and feet. But the improvements need to go beyond that if Image Playground is to gain traction. We need far more control and flexibility over the images it whips up. That means being able to import new generation models and styles, the ability to work with different aspect ratios, adjust the relative strength of each prompt, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s doubtful Apple will give us the ability to make phot-realistic images, but there is still a lot Image Playground can do to enhance its generated art. For example, the recent OpenAI GPT-4o model update allowed users to draw images in the style of a Studio Ghibli Japanese animation film. It was a viral sensation when it launched and exactly the kind of thing Image Playground needs to get some buzz.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-Better-image-generation.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Image Playground on a Max\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-Better-image-generation.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3840w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-Better-image-generation.jpg?resize=300%2C223&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-Better-image-generation.jpg?resize=768%2C571&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-Better-image-generation.jpg?resize=1200%2C893&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-Better-image-generation.jpg?resize=1536%2C1143&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-Better-image-generation.jpg?resize=2048%2C1524&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"893\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Image Playground offers rudimentary image creation at best and needs to be much better.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Photo editing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of images, Apple has brought a few AI image editing tools to our devices, yet these can also be vastly improved. In the first version of Apple Intelligence, we can remove distractions in photos using Apple Intelligence’s Clean Up tool, for example, but having the option to <em>add</em> elements to your pictures would be a fun extra. This could extend to refining existing parts of your images, such as replacing one type of tree with another in a landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d also like to get the power to remove something from one image and add it to another. Or to summon Siri and use natural language to make edits. Imagine how much hassle you could save by simply saying, “Hey Siri, change this sky to a thunderous rainstorm.”</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2-Smarter-image-editing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Intelligence image editing screenshot\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2-Smarter-image-editing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1973w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2-Smarter-image-editing.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2-Smarter-image-editing.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2-Smarter-image-editing.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2-Smarter-image-editing.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2-Smarter-image-editing.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2-Smarter-image-editing.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Intelligence 2.0: Foundational upgrades</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Natural language search</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key ideas behind artificial intelligence is that it will simplify your day-to-day life. So why isn’t Apple Intelligence very good at doing that? One key way it could improve is by adding more natural language capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could be really effective if it was added to things like Spotlight search or the Messages app. We should be able to open Spotlight or Siri and ask, “Show me photos I took between August 3 and 5.” Right now, that doesn’t work. Spotlight brings up images, sure, but only those that contain the text you typed. With a little sprinkling of Apple Intelligence, those searches could be much more useful.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-Natural-language-search.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Intelligence search\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-Natural-language-search.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1960w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-Natural-language-search.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-Natural-language-search.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-Natural-language-search.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-Natural-language-search.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-Natural-language-search.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5-Natural-language-search.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>On-device search should be the foundation of Apple intelligence.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple LLM</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the more glaring examples of Apple intelligence’s ineptitude is Siri’s integration with ChatGPT, which has the unfortunate effect of directly comparing Apple’s AI engine with a far more advanced system. The comparison is not exactly flattering to Apple’s infant AI efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we really need is for Apple to launch its own LLM to compete with the likes of ChatGPT. For one thing, this would inject far more power into Apple Intelligence’s engines and allow it to stand toe-to-toe with the industry’s best platforms. For another, it would better preserve your privacy, since you could stay in the Apple intelligence sphere without venturing off into less-secure cloud-based alternatives. With an Apple LLM behind the wheel, there would be no need to switch to other AI tools, which would keep your workflow smooth and uninterrupted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2529077/apple-is-working-on-a-huge-siri-upgrade-for-ios-19-and-macos-16.html\">Rumors have suggested</a> that this kind of Apple-backed LLM is in the works, but we don’t know when it might arrive. When it eventually does drop, it could be the jump-start Apple Intelligence needs to keep pace with its rivals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shortcuts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s Shortcuts app is one of the best tools available on your iPhone, yet I’d bet most people have never even opened it. Part of the problem is that Apple only covers the most basic of tasks, so you’re on your own if you want to run more complex workflows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a place where Apple Intelligence could step in to fill the gap. If AI was integrated into Shortcuts so that you could simply tell it what you want to do, Shortcuts would instantly go from an underused utility to one of the best iPhone features ever. As one of the main tenets of Apple intelligence, Shortcuts could suggest simple time-saving shortcuts throughout the day like Siri suggestions, and turn your iPhone into a true digital assistant.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-Automatic-shortcut-creation.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Shortcuts on a MacBook Air\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-Automatic-shortcut-creation.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-Automatic-shortcut-creation.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-Automatic-shortcut-creation.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-Automatic-shortcut-creation.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-Automatic-shortcut-creation.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-Automatic-shortcut-creation.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-Automatic-shortcut-creation.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8-Automatic-shortcut-creation.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Automatic Shortcuts could be a fantastic way to set Apple Intelligence apart from its competitors.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Health and fitness</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Health and fitness tracking has been one of Apple’s priorities in recent years, with the Apple Watch leading the way. There’s a lot of health data stashed on our devices, and there are plenty of ways that Apple’s AI could help improve health and fitness without compromising privacy. There are already rumors that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2653512/look-out-apple-intelligence-wants-to-manage-your-health.html\">Apple is working on an AI “coach”</a> to interpret the data collected by your devices and give you a more complete picture of your health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a platform could manifest itself in optimized workouts with Apple Intelligence crunching your fitness numbers and then building a custom workout plan based on your needs. Or specialized HIIT workouts, Pilates, weight training, or whatever it thinks you need to take your fitness to the next level. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6-Health-analysis.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch user looking at an alert\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6-Health-analysis.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1960w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6-Health-analysis.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6-Health-analysis.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6-Health-analysis.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6-Health-analysis.jpg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6-Health-analysis.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6-Health-analysis.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p></p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Intelligence 2.0: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Videos</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Intelligence is already being used to edit images on our iPhones, but what if it could apply its skills to videos as well? The iPhone is already one of the top video phones around and AI could take it to the next level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps that would mean creating a list of suggested edits for any project you feed into it. Or the power to remove distractions from videos in the same way you can currently do with images. Perhaps even automated color grading and audio mixing could be added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Apple will be very careful about treading on video editing – after all, it probably doesn’t want to imply it’s coming after the creative industries after the <em>Crush!</em> ad fiasco – but a few handy tools for amateur editors to play with on their iPhones would be a welcome addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the ways that Apple tried to demonstrate Apple Intelligence’s power at WWDC 2024 was through transcribing audio in the Notes app. Unfortunately, this is neither a groundbreaking feature nor one that’s even on par with rival AI platforms. It might work well for simple voice memos, but anything with more than one speaker quickly becomes a jumbled mess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a quick way Apple can fix this by teaching Apple Intelligence how to automatically label speakers—after all, services such as Otter and the tiny independent MacWhisper app have been doing it for years.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/7-Speaker-detection.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Notes app on a Mac desktop\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/7-Speaker-detection.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1960w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/7-Speaker-detection.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/7-Speaker-detection.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/7-Speaker-detection.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/7-Speaker-detection.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/7-Speaker-detection.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/7-Speaker-detection.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Apple’s Notes app does a great job of transcribing with Apple Intelligence, but it’s not yet smart enough to distinguish between different speakers.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Maps </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, Apple Maps has improved so much that many iPhone users now prefer it over Google Maps. But instead of Apple running a victory lap, Apple can use AI to enhance Maps even further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, you can search Apple Maps for things like restaurants and shops near you. But I want more than that – I want to be able to ask Apple Maps for “the best restaurants near me” and only see the highest-rated ones. Or search for eateries that serve meals with specific ingredients (this is currently very hit-and-miss). Or find out where the best viewpoints are in my city (again, this is unreliable). Apple Maps struggles with that right now, but perhaps Apple Intelligence would help it get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Intelligence can also help with directions. Siri is already pretty good at getting us from Point A to Point B, but as with much of Siri’s current features, it’s still disappointingly limited to places and addresses. Apple Intelligence could step in here to make it more powerful. For example, you could ask Siri to “get me home using the most eco-friendly route,” or “create a circular walking route in the countryside near me.” Weaving more AI into the mix might make these requests more achievable for Apple’s virtual assistant.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-Maps-suggestions.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Maps on iPhones\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-Maps-suggestions.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3840w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-Maps-suggestions.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-Maps-suggestions.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-Maps-suggestions.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-Maps-suggestions.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-Maps-suggestions.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-Maps-suggestions.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9-Maps-suggestions.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>With a little Apple Intelligence, Maps can be so much more useful.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Home</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is heavily rumored to be getting in on the smart home act with a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePad hub device</a> reportedly launching later this year and early next, and Apple Intelligence will almost certainly take on a central role in how you interact with it.
