Where individuals can sue for defamation, businesses can sue over disparagement. In this case, Musk must prove that Media Matters knowingly published false statements intended to harm X Corp.'s business to succeed in his lawsuit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985772#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985772&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"36c7a246df992b1c4c4e8242b5077e3a90acec2b67b52ce36623fd08b9f264e2","category":"Tech"}
