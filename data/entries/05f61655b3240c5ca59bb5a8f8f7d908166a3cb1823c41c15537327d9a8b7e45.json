He will target the time-trial and is looking to become the youngest time-trial gold medallist in Olympic history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tarling has secured some top results on the road over the past 12 months. He won his WorldTour level race at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/worldtour-race-ranked-men\">Renewi Tour</a> and also won at the O Gran Camiño back in February. At international time-trial championships, Tarling has a strong record. He made the podium at the 2023 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uci-world-championships\" target=\"_blank\">UCI Road World Championships</a> in Stirling. Later in the year, he won the European Championship title, defeating <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\">Wout van Aert</a>, Stefan Bissegger and Stefan Küng. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Welshman will also be on hand in the road race, hopefully with a medal already in the bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tom Pidcock</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-25T094625.102-970x647.png\" alt=\"tom pidcock tour de france 2024 paris 2024 olympics great britain road cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-25T094625.102-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-25T094625.102-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-25T094625.102-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-25T094625.102-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-25T094625.102-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-25T094625.102-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-25T094625.102-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-25T094625.102-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-25T094625.102-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-25T094625.102.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers </a>multi-discipline rider Tom Pidcock will feature in the men’s road race on Saturday 3rd August. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has a strong Classics pedigree, which should suit the course. He won the Amstel Gold Race earlier this year and Strade Bianche in 2023. With the short steep kicker of Montmartre on the agenda, this could favour the fiery Yorkshireman. Some discretion must be added given that Pidcock recently contracted Covid at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pidcock will also feature in the mountain biking at Paris 2024.

The 35-year-old has won Strade Bianche, Trofeo Alfredo Binda, Tour of Flanders, Paris-Roubaix and Liège-Bastogne-Liège over the past decade. She will most likely play a key role in supporting Pfeiffer Georgi’s chances in the women’s road race.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Full list of riders competing for Great Britain in road

Britain have a heritage in track cycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This started at Beijing 2008 when Team GB won 70% of the gold medals on offer at the velodrome. This hit rate continued into London 2012, but faltered to a respectable 60% gold medal rate at Rio 2016. At the last Olympics, Great Britain received their lowest amount of track cycling golds in two decades, dropping down to just three, a 25% conversion rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, British men have been more successful than women on the track. However, this could change in 2024 given the current strength of women’s sprinting in Britain. This will also be the first Olympic Games without Jason Kenny or Chris Hoy since 2000.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Jack Carlin</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1599367994-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"jack carlin paris 2024 track cycling\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1599367994-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1599367994-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1599367994-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1599367994-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1599367994-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1599367994-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1599367994-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1599367994-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1599367994-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1599367994-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Scotland’s best chance of a men’s cycling medal at the 2024 Games comes courtesy of sprinter Jack Carlin. He will spearhead the British team in the men’s sprint and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/japanese-keirin-sport-and-culture-beyond-the-velodrome\" target=\"_blank\">keirin</a> events in the absence of the retired Jason Kenny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 27-year-old from Paisley has won 13 medals at international competitions, however, he is yet to claim a gold. At the last Olympics in Tokyo, he took home a silver and bronze in the sprint and team sprint events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the World Championships last summer, Carlin claimed a bronze medal in the sprint. Against Dutch super-sprinter Harrie Lavreysen it will be tough for Carlin to banish his nearly-man status in the individual sprint event. However, in the team sprint, Carlin’s British teammates have a good record, scoring two podium finishes at top-tier UCI events already in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ethan Hayter</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1243994074-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"ethan hayter greta britain paris 2024 track cycling olympics\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1243994074-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1243994074-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1243994074-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1243994074-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1243994074-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1243994074-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1243994074-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1243994074-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1243994074-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1243994074-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Anne-Christine POUJOULAT / AFP</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethan Hayter will be covering multiple bases at Paris 2024. He will line up in the men’s road race as well as in the omnium, team pursuit and madison races on the track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hayter took the world title in both the omnium and team pursuit at the 2022 World Championships in Paris. There, he also claimed a silver medal in the madison alongside Ollie Wood, who will once again partner up with Hayter at the 2024 Olympics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, Hayter resumed his track form by picking up the European champion’s jersey in the omnium and team pursuit. He continued his winning ways at the Nations Cup in Canada.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it’s anything to go by, road riders usually excel in the omnium event. Groupama-FDJ’s Matt Walls took the title in Tokyo and Hayter’s Ineos teammate Elia Viviani won the gold medal in 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dan Bigham</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"649\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1918185473-970x649.jpg\" alt=\"dan bigham paris 2024 olympic games team pursuit great britain\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1918185473-970x649.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1918185473-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1918185473-768x514.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1918185473-1536x1027.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1918185473-2048x1370.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1918185473-750x502.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1918185473-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1918185473-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1918185473-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Joris Verwijst/BSR Agency/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/joss-lowden-dan-bigham-cyclist-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Bigham</a> has had an atypical journey to his debut Olympics.

The squad operated outside the British Cycling loop and on a much tighter budget but maximised aerodynamics and became the <em>agent provocateur</em> of the track cycling world. After this, Bigham soon joined the British track team and quickly became captain of the men’s pursuit squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bigham broke the British hour record <em>and </em>the world hour record between 2021 and 2022 and has been a performance engineer at Ineos Grenadiers, being a key part in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/filippo-ganna-hour-record\" target=\"_blank\">Filippo Ganna’s Hour record</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the track, Bigham has taken a gold medal in the World Championships in the team pursuit back in 2022, and a silver in the individual pursuit in 2023. He was also part of the team that became European champions at the beginning of 2024 and the squad that won a round of the UCI Nations Cup in April.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Emma Finucane</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2082109360-min-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"emma finucane paris 2024 olympic in track cycling great britain\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2082109360-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2082109360-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2082109360-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2082109360-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2082109360-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2082109360-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2082109360-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2082109360-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2082109360-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2082109360-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Welsh-born<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/emma-finucane-interview\" target=\"_blank\"> Emma Finucane</a> has picked up the baton from the golden generation of British track racing. Based on recent results, Emma Finucane is the track rider most likely to win gold in Paris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the age of 20 last summer in Glasgow, Finucane made a major breakthrough at the World Championships. In qualifying for the sprint, she broke the 200m flying lap world record and later secured the title after defeating Lea Sophie Friedrich in the final. In doing so, Finucane became the first British woman to win the sprint world title in a decade. She backed up this title with a gold medal and rainbow jersey in the team sprint event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finucane has continued this form into 2024. At the European Championships in January, she won the individual sprint title and two silvers in the team sprint and keirin races. At Paris 2024, she will be competing for Great Britain in those three events.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Neah Evans</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1244011787-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"neah evans track cycling paris 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1244011787-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1244011787-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1244011787-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1244011787-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1244011787-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1244011787-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1244011787-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1244011787-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1244011787-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1244011787-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Thomson Sampson/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before becoming an Olympian, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/neah-evans-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Neah Evans</a> was a vet.

The BMX race made its debut at the Beijing 2008 Games and the BMX freestyle was introduced at the last Olympics in Tokyo. The race is set around a short track where a handful of riders will throw themselves around the winding course. The freestyle on the other hand is about scoring points with tricks and stunts in a skate-park setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until 2020, no British rider had won a medal in the BMX events. At the last Olympics however, Great Britain swept the golds in the women’s events courtesy of Charlotte Worthington and Beth Shriever, while the men in Tokyo claimed silver and bronze medals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Charlotte Worthington</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435-970x546.jpg\" alt=\"charlotte worthington\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/skysports-charlotte-worthington_5464435.jpg 1600w\" /><figcaption>Ezra Shaw via Getty</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>28-year-old Mancunian Charlotte Worthington is already an Olympic champion.
