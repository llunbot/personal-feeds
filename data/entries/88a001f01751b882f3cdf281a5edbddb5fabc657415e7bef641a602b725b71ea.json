{"title":"MacRumors Giveaway: Win an iPhone 15 Pro From GRID Studio","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/28/macrumors-giveaway-iphone-grid-studio-june/","date":1719592325000,"content":"For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with GRID Studio to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a 256GB <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>. GRID Studio is well known for transforming old, discarded Apple devices into displayable artwork.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/grid-studio-iphone-2g.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nGRID Studio deconstructs Apple devices and artfully arranges the components underneath a glass frame. Each part is labeled and accompanied by relevant historical details. GRID Studio's most iconic piece <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation\">is the GRID 1</a>, priced at $400.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe GRID 1 features the original Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> from 2007, highlighting the parts that made up an important part of Apple's history. The iconic original ‌‌iPhone‌‌ casing is positioned next to the power button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, ear piece, and other components, and this is before the days where Apple started making its own chips so there are some unique components to see.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Grid-1st-gen.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\niPod fans will be interested in the <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-ipod-photo\">$120 GRID iPod Photo</a>, which originally came out in 2004, and was the first iPod featuring a color display. It has the same classic click wheel design, but with a 220x176 LCD display. This model is a fun part of Apple's past because it was the first iPod that really supported storing and showing off photos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/grid-studio-ipod-photo.jpg\" width=\"1440\" height=\"810\" />\r<br />\nMost of GRID Studio's pieces are designed to be hung on the wall, but there are also a selection of products that can be displayed on a shelf or tabletop. The $99 <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-3gs-wooden-tabletop-frames\">GRID 3GS Wooden Tabletop Frame</a> has an attractive wood backing and acrylic cover that can be hung on the wall or displayed upright on a table with a support rod.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/grid-studio-iphone-3GS.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone‌ 3GS followed the ‌iPhone‌ 3G, and that \"S\" was meant to represent speed. It had a processor that was twice as fast, and was Apple's first foray into really focusing on blazing fast performance. The GRID 3GS features the classic pre-iPhone 4 design, and it looks great in the wooden frame.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGRID Studio is <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/pages/summersale\">hosting a summer sale</a> that will last until July 17, and various GRID pieces are available at up to 50 percent off.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have one 256GB ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ to give away to a <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
