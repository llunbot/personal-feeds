But there's a distinction in that US officials will publicly discuss, at least in broad terms, the purpose of the X-37B and release images of the spacecraft.</p>\n<p>The US military has two X-37Bs in its inventory, each with a cargo bay that could fit a large refrigerator. They resemble small space shuttles, with dimensions about one-quarter those of NASA's retired shuttle orbiters. The X-37B spaceplanes have flown in space six times, logging missions as long as two-and-a-half years, thanks to deployable solar panels that generate power for greater endurance.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991189#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991189&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c3df63d8445b38762e15155d6714b18e0cf9d296222f9497eae5650eb11b639f","category":"Tech"}
