For the model, I choose <strong>Stability AI</strong> and <strong>Stable Image Ultra</strong>.</p> \n<p>As prompt, I type:</p> \n<p><code>A stylized picture of a cute old steampunk robot with in its hands a sign written in chalk that says \"Stable Image Ultra in Amazon Bedrock\".</code></p> \n<p>I leave all other options to their default values and choose <strong>Run</strong>. After a few seconds, I get what I asked. Here’s the image:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/29/stability-ai-bedrock-robot.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/08/29/stability-ai-bedrock-robot-300x300.png\" alt=\"A stylized picture of a cute old steampunk robot with in its hands a sign written in chalk that says &quot;Stable Image Ultra in Amazon Bedrock&quot;.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a></p> \n<p><span><strong>Using Stable Image Ultra with the AWS CLI<br /> </strong></span>While I am still in the console <strong>Image playground</strong>, I choose the three small dots in the corner of the playground window and then <strong>View API request</strong>. In this way, I can see the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)</a> command equivalent to what I just did in the console:</p> \n<div> \n <div> \n  <pre><code>aws bedrock-runtime invoke-model \\\n--model-id stability.stable-image-ultra-v1:0 \\\n--body \"{\\\"prompt\\\":\\\"A stylized picture of a cute old steampunk robot with in its hands a sign written in chalk that says \\\\\\\"Stable Image Ultra in Amazon Bedrock\\\\\\\".\\\",\\\"mode\\\":\\\"text-to-image\\\",\\\"aspect_ratio\\\":\\\"1:1\\\",\\\"output_format\\\":\\\"jpeg\\\"}\" \\\n--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \\\n--region us-west-2 \\\ninvoke-model-output.txt</code></pre> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>To use Stable Image Core or Stable Diffusion 3 Large, I can <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids.html\">replace the model ID</a>.</p> \n<p>The previous command outputs the image in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64\">Base64</a> format inside a JSON object in a text file.</p> \n<p>To get the image with a single command, I write the output JSON file to standard output and use the <strong><a href=\"https://jqlang.github.io/jq/\">jq</a></strong> tool to extract the encoded image so that it can be decoded on the fly. The output is written in the <code>img.png</code> file. Here’s the full command:</p> \n<div> \n <div> \n  <pre><code>aws bedrock-runtime invoke-model \\\n--model-id stability.stable-image-ultra-v1:0 \\\n--body \"{\\\"prompt\\\":\\\"A stylized picture of a cute old steampunk robot with in its hands a sign written in chalk that says \\\\\\\"Stable Image Ultra in Amazon Bedrock\\\\\\\".\\\",\\\"mode\\\":\\\"text-to-image\\\",\\\"aspect_ratio\\\":\\\"1:1\\\",\\\"output_format\\\":\\\"jpeg\\\"}\" \\\n--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \\\n--region us-west-2 \\\n/dev/stdout | jq -r '.images[0]' | base64 --decode &gt; img.png</code></pre> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p><span><strong>Using Stable Image Ultra with AWS SDKs<br /> </strong></span>Here’s how you can use Stable Image Ultra with the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/\">AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)</a>. This simple application interactively asks for a text-to-image prompt and then calls Amazon Bedrock to generate the image.</p> \n<pre><code>import base64\nimport boto3\nimport json\nimport os\n\nMODEL_ID = \"stability.stable-image-ultra-v1:0\"\n\nbedrock_runtime = boto3.client(\"bedrock-runtime\", region_name=\"us-west-2\")\n\nprint(\"Enter a prompt for the text-to-image model:\")\nprompt = input()\n\nbody = {\n    \"prompt\": prompt,\n    \"mode\": \"text-to-image\"\n}\nresponse = bedrock_runtime.invoke_model(modelId=MODEL_ID, body=json.dumps(body))\n\nmodel_response = json.loads(response[\"body\"].read())\n\nbase64_image_data = model_response[\"images\"][0]\n\ni, output_dir = 1, \"output\"\nif not os.path.exists(output_dir):\n    os.makedirs(output_dir)\nwhile os.path.exists(os.path.join(output_dir, f\"img_{i}.png\")):\n    i += 1\n\nimage_data = base64.b64decode(base64_image_data)\n\nimage_path = os.path.join(output_dir, f\"img_{i}.png\")\nwith open(image_path, \"wb\") as file:\n    file.write(image_data)\n\nprint(f\"The generated image has been saved to {image_path}\")</code></pre> \n<p>The application writes the resulting image in an <code>output</code> directory that is created if not present. To not overwrite existing files, the code checks for existing files to find the first file name available with the <code>img_&lt;number&gt;.png</code> format.</p> \n<p>More examples of how to use Stable Diffusion models are available in the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/code-library/latest/ug/python_3_bedrock-runtime_code_examples.html#stable_diffusion\">Code Library</a> of the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/\">AWS Documentation</a>.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Customer voices<br /> </strong></span>Learn from Ken Hoge, Global Alliance Director, Stability AI, how Stable Diffusion models are reshaping the industry from text-to-image to video, audio, and 3D, and how Amazon Bedrock empowers customers with an all-in-one, secure, and scalable solution.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Step into a world where reading comes alive with Nicolette Han, Product Owner, Stride Learning.
