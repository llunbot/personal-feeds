The game overall appears to be similar to the well-known kiss, marry, kill game.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple asks her favorite music, how she starts making music, her go-to sidekick, her ideal birthday gift, her favorite hairstyles, what super power she would want, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt sounds like this will be an ongoing series for Apple, so we can expect to see additional artists featured in the mini Play, Pause, Delete YouTube game show.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/\">Apple ads</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/18/apple-play-pause-delete-game-show/\">Apple Shares New 'Play, Pause, Delete' Mini Game Show Video With Coi Leray</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-new-play-pause-delete-mini-game-show-video-with-coi-leray.2307943/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zY74A_EElpY:UQWjB7LsqUo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zY74A_EElpY:UQWjB7LsqUo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/zY74A_EElpY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"67e7f2c6bb4247bd8d711b1e076bbcdf2eaa8bdc9da5d6a37a72510369ad84a9","category":"Apple"}
