Apple’s answer to the Nest Hub or Echo Show, such a device would be able to show you views from HomeKit-compatible cameras or doorbells, visually display calendar or weather information, carry on FaceTime conversations, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sleuths at <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/09/touchscreen-interface-tvos-homepod/\">9to5Mac</a> have found what may be the best evidence yet that such a device is on the way. Hidden within the tvOS 18 developer beta 3 is an interface obviously made for touchscreens–something you wouldn’t normally find in an operating system made for Apple TV.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Touch interface for homepod\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1434w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>The hidden PlasterBoard interface has a keypad like the one on the iPhone and iPad.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Touch interface for homepod\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1434w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The hidden PlasterBoard interface has a keypad like the one on the iPhone and iPad.</p></figcaption></figure><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/09/touchscreen-interface-tvos-homepod/\" target=\"_blank\">9to5Mac</a></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Touch interface for homepod\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1434w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/homepod-9to5.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The hidden PlasterBoard interface has a keypad like the one on the iPhone and iPad.</p></figcaption></figure><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/09/touchscreen-interface-tvos-homepod/\" target=\"_blank\">9to5Mac</a></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/09/touchscreen-interface-tvos-homepod/\" target=\"_blank\">9to5Mac</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This system shell, called “PlasterBoard,” is suspected to be the working interface for a HomePod with a display. HomePods currently run an operating system based on tvOS, so it makes sense to find this interface there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PlasterBoard, at least in the tvOS beta 3, doesn’t have much more to it than a lock screen interface with a numeric keypad similar to what you would find on an iPhone or iPad. But internal development would be much further along–that any of this is tucked away in a beta that got out to the public (even in a developer beta) likely means there is significant work happening behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We would guess that such a device would ship in 2025, but if the software effort is further along than we suspect, it could potentially make it a surprise this fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to take advantage of Apple Intelligence, a new HomePod would be required—display or no display—as the processor inside HomePods today is not capable of running the requisite AI models. In order to run <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a>, this new device would need to have at least an M1 or A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM.</p>\n\nHomePod, Smart Speakers</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cf26d41c415720fca0aee001f7827823133da79ea47c3b6bd51397c70f294eb9","category":"Apple"}
