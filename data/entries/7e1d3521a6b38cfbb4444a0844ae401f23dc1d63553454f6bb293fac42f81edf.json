If successful, Canon’s “nanoimprint” technology could give back Japanese manufacturers some of the edge they ceded to rivals in South Korea, Taiwan and, increasingly, China over the past three decades.</p>\n<p>“We would like to start shipping this year or next year... we want to do it while the market is hot,” said Hiroaki Takeishi, head of Canon’s industrial group, who has overseen the development of the new lithography machines. “It is a very unique technology that will enable cutting-edge chips to be made simply and at a low cost.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999552#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999552&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Financial Times","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7e1d3521a6b38cfbb4444a0844ae401f23dc1d63553454f6bb293fac42f81edf","category":"Tech"}
