That year, Ferrari, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/07/gallery-hybrid-hypercar-happy-hour/\">Porsche, and McLaren</a> debuted limited-run hybrids that informed what would soon come to pass for each brand, with all three embracing electrons for the powertrains of at least one of their production vehicles.</p>\n<p>Lamborghini's name has been mostly absent from the discussion of hybrid supercars, and while the company teased us with electrified possibilities over the years, it was happy to let its V10 and V12 engines do all the talking. Now, the V10s are screaming off into the sunset, and Lamborghini is on the precipice of a new electrified future, one that begins with the Revuelto, the replacement for the V12 Aventador and the brand's first production plug-in hybrid.</p>\n<p>During the 2023 New York International Auto Show, Ars had a chance to check out the Revuelto up close and to speak to Lamborghini Chief Technical Officer <span>Rouven Mohr</span> about the car's development, its challenges, and what to expect from Lamborghini in the future.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934463#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934463&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"301154644e05135165fd5bf1a9ae0542bc3cd0bdc3efea7f8df74052c6fe9d76","category":"Tech"}
