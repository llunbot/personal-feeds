The existing 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌ is equipped with a standard LCD panel, and the move to mini-LED technology for the 12.9-inch model would have provided increased brightness for HDR content, deeper blacks, lower power consumption, and more. He said the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌ would use leftover mini-LED display panels from the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, with the 10.9-inch model sticking with LCDs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNow, in a <a href=\"https://x.com/dsccross/status/1783153530678944154?s=46&amp;t=7hGG_t1VNNuDJze42Vj_-w\">post to subscribers</a> on X (formerly Twitter), he said that this is no longer expected to be the case due to the panel's high cost, despite confirmation from multiple supply chain sources. As a result, both ‌iPad Air‌ models will feature LCD displays, clearly delineating them from the ‌iPad Pro‌, which is expected to move to OLED.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, Young added that there may be a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> model with a 12.9-inch mini-LED display introduced in the fourth quarter of 2024. Speculatively, the device could be a high-end ‌iPad Air‌, a low-end ‌iPad Pro‌, or something else entirely. Next-generation ‌iPad Air‌ and ‌iPad Pro‌ models are expected to be announced at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/\">Apple's \"Let loose\" event</a> on May 7.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mini-led/\">Mini-LED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2024-ipad-air/\">2024 iPad Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/12-9-inch-ipad-air-will-not-feature-mini-led/\">12.9-Inch iPad Air No Longer Expected to Feature Mini-LED Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/12-9-inch-ipad-air-no-longer-expected-to-feature-mini-led-display.2424821/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f26ff434b90b1c194cd049135dea033ee58ea62c773744dee5599c23f5534a84","category":"Apple"}
