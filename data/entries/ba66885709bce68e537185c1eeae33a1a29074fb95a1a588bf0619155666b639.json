And while there’s really nothing radically unique about them, the completely revamped shoes do look solid, delivering much of the performance of Northwave’s top-level pro road shoes, just with added comfort and the option for a wide fit to appeal to a broader group of recreational road riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Northwave Revolution carbon performance road bike shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_side-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_side-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Northwave Revolution revamped carbon-soled performance road bike shoes, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_side-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_side-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_side-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_side-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_side-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_side-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_side-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Northwave)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Northwave says not to call it “mid-range” but that’s exactly what the Revolution road shoes are. They’ve been around for years a step below Northwave’s Extreme family. But now, just like last fall’s top-tier <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/northwave-veloce-extreme-road-shoe-increase-your-watts/\" target=\"_blank\">Veloce Extreme</a> road shoe upgrade, the more affordable Revolutions are better than ever, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new? What’s not new!</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_dial-lacing-mesh-tongue-detail-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_dial-lacing-mesh-tongue-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Northwave Revolution revamped carbon-soled performance road bike shoes, now in wide fit sizes too, top view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_dial-lacing-mesh-tongue-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_dial-lacing-mesh-tongue-detail-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_dial-lacing-mesh-tongue-detail-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_dial-lacing-mesh-tongue-detail-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_dial-lacing-mesh-tongue-detail-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The revamped Northwave Revolution is pretty much all-new. The most obvious change on the outside is the new multi-layer laminated polyurethane synthetic upper. It now gets more advanced reinforcement around the instep &amp; heel for improved support, plus laser-perforated holes on both sides &amp; over the toebox for good ventilation. Plus, there’s a new laminated mesh tongue construction to also help keep your feet cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_new-13-stiffness-Morph-Carbon-composite-sole-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_new-13-stiffness-Morph-Carbon-composite-sole-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Northwave Revolution revamped carbon-soled performance road bike shoes, 13/15 stiffness Morph Carbon composite sole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_new-13-stiffness-Morph-Carbon-composite-sole-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_new-13-stiffness-Morph-Carbon-composite-sole-297x134.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_new-13-stiffness-Morph-Carbon-composite-sole-1536x691.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_new-13-stiffness-Morph-Carbon-composite-sole-120x54.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_new-13-stiffness-Morph-Carbon-composite-sole-768x346.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The next big shift is underneath. The new Northwave Revolution now features a stiffer 13/15 full injection-molded carbon composite sole for efficient but comfortable pedaling. The new Morph Carbon sole now features thru-venting under the cleat, a rubber toe block for walkability &amp; bump protection, and a replaceable rubber heel tread block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It still incorporates Powershape arch support, compatibility with traditional 3-bolt road cleats, and direct mounting of low-stack Wahoo/Speedplay pedals with the optional Northwave adapter plate.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_front-view-riding-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_front-view-riding-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Northwave Revolution revamped carbon-soled performance road bike shoes, front view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_front-view-riding-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_front-view-riding-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_front-view-riding-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_front-view-riding-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_front-view-riding-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, a new Wide Fit option, too. More than just making them wider, Northwave reshaped the Revolution Wide shoes with different toe, metatarsal &amp; instep dimensions optimized around still providing a high performance for cyclists that need more volume.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_inside-detail-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_inside-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Northwave Revolution revamped carbon-soled performance road bike shoes, inside instep\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_inside-detail-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_inside-detail-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_inside-detail-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_inside-detail-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_inside-detail-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_inside-detail-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Retention is pretty much the same as before, with 2 of Northwave’s proprietary SLW3 dials, a crossed lower lace layout for micro adjust of midfoot tension, and silicone heel grippers</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>easy-clean perforated PU synthetic leather upper</li>\n\n\n\n<li>new Morph Carbon 13 injected carbon composite sole with Powershape arch support</li>\n\n\n\n<li>13/15 sole stiffness</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3-bolt Look-style &amp; 4-bolt Speedplay (with optional insert) pedal compatibility</li>\n\n\n\n<li>dual SLW3 dial lacing adjustment </li>\n\n\n\n<li>standard Pro fit or Wide fit</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>2025 Northwave Revolution road shoes – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_now-in-wide-fit-sizes-too_standard-colors-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_now-in-wide-fit-sizes-too_standard-colors-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Northwave Revolution revamped carbon-soled performance road bike shoes, now in wide fit sizes too, standard colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_now-in-wide-fit-sizes-too_standard-colors-jpg.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_now-in-wide-fit-sizes-too_standard-colors-297x149.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_now-in-wide-fit-sizes-too_standard-colors-1536x768.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_now-in-wide-fit-sizes-too_standard-colors-120x60.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_now-in-wide-fit-sizes-too_standard-colors-768x384.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2025-Northwave-Revolution-revamped-carbon-soled-performance-road-bike-shoes_now-in-wide-fit-sizes-too_standard-colors-2048x1024.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The completely renewed Northwave Revolution road cycling shoes promise a ‘pro’ look at a more affordable price with a bit of flex for better all-day comfort.
