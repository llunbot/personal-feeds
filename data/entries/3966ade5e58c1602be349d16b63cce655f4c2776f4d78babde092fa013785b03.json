In addition, the tweaked kinematics are intended to improve bump absorption, and new cable headset routing aims to improve the aesthetic and silence the bike.</p>\n<p>Propain has also introduced more sizes and sought to maintain the bike’s versatility with options to run 27.5in, mixed or 29in wheels, depending on frame size.</p>\n<p>There are also new build kits, with Propain offering four models. Using the online configurator, buyers can custom-spec the Tyee.</p>\n<p>Propains is offering all four build kits, from the cheapest to the most expensive for its aluminium and carbon frames. Prices start at €2,999 (UK and US price TBC) and top out at £8,244/$8,244/€8,244.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Frame and suspension details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A render of the new cable routing, and working of the Acros ICR headset and Sixpack stem.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Propain bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>Propain has made several revisions in an attempt to improve the rider experience. One of the biggest is the cable routing, which runs internally through the headset.</p>\n<p>The brand was approached by Acros with its ICR (Integrated Cable Routing) headset, realising the benefits after testing, and integrating it into the new Tyee.</p>\n<p>To do this, Propain worked with German components manufacturer Sixpack.</p>\n<p>The cables enter the frame through a composite spacer moulded to fit a CNC-machined stem. The cables run through the upper headset bearing and into the frame’s down tube.</p>\n<p>While the spacer has a rubber insert to minimise water ingress, the ICR headset uses stainless steel bearings that won’t corrode if moisture finds its way inside. Propain claims the system delivers “A clean and completely silent cockpit”.</p>\n<p>This spacer is around 10mm tall, and you’ll always need to run it. The Carbon frame doesn’t feature traditional cable entry ports. However, the aluminium frame does.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Propain’s new cable routing. The alloy frame still features traditional cable ports on the side.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Falch Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>Propain has updated the cable routing, with the cables running directly across the main rear-triangle pivots to keep the silent-bike treatment going.</p>\n<p>The bike also features a new chainstay and seatstay protector. It’s made from a soft TPR plastic and features angled air-filled nubs to minimise noise and absorb vibrations. Propain has also fitted an updated down tube protector.</p>\n<p>You’ll also find a new rear-brake mount. The postmount is integrated into the rear triangle. Propain claims this offers a better aesthetic and a better transfer of braking forces to the frame. The frame will take 180mm or 200/203mm rotors. A quick adjustment to the mount enables you to fit either.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rear-brake mount has been tucked inside the stays for a cleaner aesthetic and better force transmission to the frame. Maximum rotor size is 203mm.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Falch Photograpghy</i></span></div>\n<p>Propain has included a flip chip in the upper link to add versatility to the bike. This enables riders on medium, large or extra-large frames to choose between a 29in or 27.5in rear wheel, while maintaining the bike’s geometry.</p>\n<p>Inside the front triangle are mounts for a bottle cage and tool accessories. Propain uses double-sealed Acros stainless steel frame bearings with Propain Dirt Shields for added grime protection on all bike frames, regardless of their price point.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new rear triangle gets a flip chip so riders can choose between 27.5in and 29in wheels.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Falch Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>The frame uses a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-universal-derailleur-hanger/\">SRAM Universal Derailleur Hanger</a> interface to fit the latest SRAM Eagle AXS Transmission gearing.</p>\n<p>Propain still uses its Blend Carbon and Blend Alloy frame construction. This is said to optimise carbon fibre types and layups in order to deliver the best strength, weight and impact resistance. The Blend Alloy uses three different alloys in the frame to achieve the same goal.</p>\n<p>Both the aluminium and carbon frames get new rear triangles. Propain claims it has increased the rear triangle stiffness by 10 per cent compared to the older model to deliver more direct and precise handling. These also offer greater tyre clearance.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> New stay protection is designed to minimise noise and chain vibrations, and keep the Tyee looking better for longer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Falch Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>With increased stiffness and added reach, the carbon frame is 100g heavier than before at a claimed 2.9kg for a size M 29in frame. However, for the aluminium frame, Propain claims it could shave off 300g for an identical-spec frame, coming in at 3.4kg.</p>\n<p>Due to the frame’s construction, the carbon fibre and alloy frames receive a category 5 strength rating, giving them unrestricted bike park clearance.</p>\n<h3>Better bounce</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Propain has tweaked the Tyee’s PRO10 suspension platform to deliver better consistency through its travel and improved bump absorption.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nathan Hughes</i></span></div>\n<p>Propain has tweaked the Tyee’s kinematics. The bike still uses the PRO10 counter-rotating link design with a solid rear triangle. However, adjustments to the pivot placements have allowed Propain to flatten the overall leverage rate. That should give the Tyee a more consistent and predictable feel through its travel.</p>\n<p>Propain has also lowered the anti-squat over the previous Tyee. It still sits at a claimed 113 per cent at sag, which should provide good pedalling characteristics. However, the lower anti-squat will help offer more sensitive suspension to improve traction and comfort. This also reduces pedal kickback.</p>\n<p>With the new kinematics, the Tyee’s suspension is capable of running an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/coil-vs-air/\">air or coil shock</a>.</p>\n<p>The new Tyee has a slightly more forward axle path, ending up 3mm further forward at full travel.</p>\n<h2>Sizing and geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The updates to the Tyee’s shape should give it more stability at speed than the old model.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nathan Hughes</i></span></div>\n<p>Propain has made subtle changes to the geometry of the 2023 Tyee, which are intended to add stability at speed. However, the Tyee doesn’t push the progressive geometry envelope and stays in the centre of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">enduro bike</a> spectrum.</p>\n<p>The wheel options are frame-size dependent. The XS and S sizes use 27.5in wheels exclusively. The M bike is most versatile, with 27.5in, mixed and 29in wheel options. The L and XL sizes are available with mixed or 29in wheels.</p>\n<p>Propain also offers the Tyee with 160mm or 170mm fork options.</p>\n<p>The shape changes include extending the reach numbers by 5mm and slackening the head tube angle by 0.5 degrees. For the 170mm-fork bikes, this gives reach figures of 400.5mm, 425.5mm, 450.5mm, 475.5mm and 500.5mm for the XS, S, M, L and XL sizes, respectively. For the 160mm forks, the reach numbers are 4.5mm longer.</p>\n<p>The head tube angles are 64.1 degrees across the board for the 170mm forks. The effective seat tube angles get slacker progressively as frame sizes increase, ranging from 77.5 degrees for the size S to 77.1 degrees for the XL bike. With a 160mm fork fitted, these numbers are 0.4 degrees steeper.</p>\n<p>For the XS, S and M bikes with 27.5in wheels, the chainstays are a snappy 430mm. For the M, L and XL frames with the mixed wheels/29in frame, the chainstays are more stable at 445mm.</p>\n<p>The seat tube lengths have been trimmed for better compatibility with longer-travel <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper posts</a>. They range between 380mm, 400mm, 425mm, 450mm and 480mm for the XS to XL sizes.</p>\n<p>The standover height is 10mm lower than the old Tyee, which should help with manoeuvrability.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Propain Tyee - 160mm fork</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Size</td><td>Extra-small</td><td>Small</td><td>Medium 27.5</td><td>Medium mix/29</td><td>Large</td><td>Extra-large</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Reach</b> (mm)</td><td>405</td><td>430</td><td>455</td><td>455</td><td>480</td><td>505</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Head angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>64.5</td><td>64.5</td><td>64.5</td><td>64.5</td><td>64.5</td><td>64.5</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat tube angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>77.9</td><td>77.7</td><td>77.6</td><td>77.5</td><td>77.5</td><td>77.4</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat tube</b> (mm)</td><td>380</td><td>400</td><td>425</td><td>425</td><td>450</td><td>480</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Chainstay </b>(mm)</td><td>430</td><td>430</td><td>430</td><td>445</td><td>445</td><td>445</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Wheelbase</b> (mm)</td><td>1,153</td><td>1,186</td><td>1,218</td><td>1,231</td><td>1,260</td><td>1,290</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Bottom bracket height </b>(mm)</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>27</td><td>27</td><td>27</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Stack</b> (mm)</td><td>576</td><td>594</td><td>607</td><td>621</td><td>630</td><td>639</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Top tube </b>(mm)</td><td>528</td><td>559</td><td>588</td><td>592</td><td>620</td><td>647</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Standover </b>(mm)</td><td>CF:776 / AL: 783</td><td>CF:776 / AL: 783</td><td>CF:776 / AL: 783</td><td>CF:776 / AL: 783</td><td>CF:776 / AL: 783</td><td>CF:776 / AL: 783</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Propain Tyee - 170mm fork</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Size</td><td>Extra-small</td><td>Small</td><td>Medium 27.5</td><td>Medium mix/29</td><td>Large</td><td>Extra-large</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Reach</b> (mm)</td><td>401</td><td>426</td><td>451</td><td>451</td><td>476</td><td>501</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Head angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>64.1</td><td>64.1</td><td>64.1</td><td>64.1</td><td>64.1</td><td>64.1</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat tube angle </b>(degrees)</td><td>77.5</td><td>77.5</td><td>77.5</td><td>77.1</td><td>77.1</td><td>77.1</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat tube</b> (mm)</td><td>380</td><td>400</td><td>425</td><td>425</td><td>450</td><td>480</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Chainstay</b> (mm)</td><td>430</td><td>430</td><td>430</td><td>445</td><td>445</td><td>445</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Wheelbase</b> (mm)</td><td>1,157</td><td>1,190</td><td>1,222</td><td>1,235</td><td>1,264</td><td>1,294</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Bottom bracket offset</b> (mm)</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>24</td><td>24</td><td>24</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Stack </b>(mm)</td><td>579</td><td>597</td><td>610</td><td>624</td><td>633</td><td>642</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Top tube</b> (mm)</td><td>528</td><td>559</td><td>588</td><td>592</td><td>620</td><td>647</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Standover</b> (mm)</td><td>CF: 779, AL:786</td><td>CF: 779, AL:786</td><td>CF: 779, AL:786</td><td>CF: 779, AL:786</td><td>CF: 779, AL:786</td><td>CF: 779, AL:786</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Models and pricing</h2>\n<p>The starting price of the Tyee AL remains at €2,999, and the Tyee CF at €3,599 (UK and US prices TBC). Propain continues to enable buyers to customise their bikes with its online configurator. That means people can prioritise the frame and components that best suit their budget and needs.</p>\n<p>However, Propain has rolled out four build options for the new Tyee and has updated the naming convention. The build kits are recommendations from Propain for their customers based on how they configure their own bikes.</p>\n<p>These build options include the Price2Ride, SHRED2, Phantom and Goldrush. All these build kits are available with an aluminium or carbon frame.</p>\n<p>Good news for UK customers is that Propain has updates its online pricing. Going forwards, VAT and Import Duty are included in the price, so there are no additional costs or forms to fill in before shipping. The price you see online is what you’ll pay.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Propain Tyee Price2Ride</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Propain Tyee AL Price2Ride 29.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Falch Photography</i></span></div>\n<p>This is Propain’s ‘ready to shred’ option, which is intended to deliver the most fun for the least money.
