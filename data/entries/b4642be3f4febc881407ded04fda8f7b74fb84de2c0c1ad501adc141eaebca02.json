The company is expected to release a large-screen foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> or MacBook to kick-off its foray into the product category before launching a higher volume foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne Apple foldable with a 20.3-inch display will apparently start production in late 2025, which is sooner than previously expected. This time frame is said to be supported by information from Korean display makers, as well as American and Taiwanese hinge manufacturers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">foldable iPhone</a> will allegedly feature a 7.9-inch or 8.3-inch display. The company may launch two foldables with these two display size options, or it may opt for a single display size option only. The foldable ‌iPhone‌ could form a new ultra-high end smartphone line for Apple. The device is currently scheduled to reach mass production late 2026, a year after the 20.3-inch foldable.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/\">Foldable iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/first-apple-foldable-coming-in-2025/\">Report: Apple's First Foldables Coming in 2025 and 2026</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apples-first-foldables-coming-in-2025-and-2026.2425554/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b4642be3f4febc881407ded04fda8f7b74fb84de2c0c1ad501adc141eaebca02","category":"Apple"}
