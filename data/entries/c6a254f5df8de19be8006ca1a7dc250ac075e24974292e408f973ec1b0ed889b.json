The good news is that Apple supports iPhones for a long time. In general, you’ll get seven to eight years of software updates, while battery and other repairs are often available on five to seven-year-old handsets, according to Apple’s Vintage and Obsolete categorizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on to find out <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1811287/which-version-of-ios-can-my-iphone-run.html\">which iPhones are supported with the latest operating systems</a>, and which are supported for servicing and repairs. We also have guides for getting<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670438/will-apple-replace-a-broken-iphone-your-rights-explained.html\"> a broken iPhone fixed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/apple-products-repair-3802247/#toc-3802247-4\">how much Apple product repairs cost.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How long does Apple support iOS?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a general rule, Apple doesn’t guarantee any length of time for updates. However, buyers can expect at least five years of iOS updates and six years of security updates, though Apple regularly goes beyond that. For example, we expect the iPhone XS and XR to be dropped from support when iOS 19 arrives in 2025, giving those phones seven years of OS and security updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chart below shows each version of iOS and the iPhones it ran on. As you can see, in recent years support for new iOS versions has stretched back for around six years, while if you include the past three versions, security support goes back a further year. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Every-version-of-iOS-and-the-iPhone-supported.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Every iOS and every iPhone it supports\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Every-version-of-iOS-and-the-iPhone-supported.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 710w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Every-version-of-iOS-and-the-iPhone-supported.jpg?resize=262%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 262w\" width=\"710\" height=\"814\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Every version of iOS and the iPhones it ran on.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple issues security updates for the current version of iOS and, usually, the two preceding versions. Since the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-latest-version-release-problems-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a> on September 16, 2024, we can expect security updates for iOS 18, iOS 17 and iOS 16. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> received a security update on the day iOS 18 was released. (Note: It is possible Apple won’t continue to update iOS 17 because iOS 18 is compatible with the same phones.) iOS 16 was last updated on Augsut 7, 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From time to time Apple issues important security updates for iOS. It doesn’t issue an update for every version of iOS though, which means that some iPhones will not get this fix for what could be dangerous vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone OS history</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first <strong>iPhone</strong>, which launched in 2007, was able to run iPhone OS 3, which was supported by Apple up until 2010. The iPhone is considered obsolete by Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>iPhone 3G</strong>, which launched in 2008, was able to run iOS 4.0, which was itself supported until 2011. The iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS are considered obsolete by Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The length of support increased with the launch of the <strong>iPhone 4s</strong> in 2011. That phone was able to run operating systems all the way up to iOS 9. Apple was still supporting iOS 9 in 2019 when it issued a GPS-related update that July. The iPhones 4 and 4s are considered obsolete by Apple.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>iPhone 5c</strong> runs iOS 10, which also received the GPS-related update in July 2019. The iPhones 5 and 5c are considered obsolete by Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>iPhone 5s</strong> and <strong>iPhone 6</strong> both run iOS 12, for which Apple issued a security update in January 2023. This update was issued for those few devices that don’t support iOS 15. Apple is unlikely to continue support for iOS 12. These phones are considered vintage by Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 15, which arrived in September 2021, supports all iPhones from <strong>iPhone 6s</strong> onwards, just as with iOS 14 and iOS 13. Both iOS 14 and 13 are considered obsolete by Apple because the same phones can run iOS 15. The iPhone 6s is already considered vintage by Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/631448/ios-16-features-compatibility-how-to-update.html\">iOS 16</a>, which arrived in September 2022 runs on all iPhones from the <strong>iPhone 8</strong> onwards – but do note that not all features are available on the older handsets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> arrived in September 2023 and runs on all iPhones from the <strong>iPhone XS</strong> onwards – meaning the iPhone X and iPhone 8 will be stuck with iOS 16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-latest-version-release-problems-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a> arrives on September 16, 2024, and, like iOS 17, will run on all iPhones from the <strong>iPhone XS</strong> onwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the oldest iPhone still supported?  </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the oldest version of iOS supported with regular security updates is iOS 17, the oldest iPhones supported by Apple will be the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR. These phones were all introduced six years ago in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means the following iPhone models will no longer receive regular updates, though some models may occasionally get a critical security update:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone X (2017)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 8/8 Plus (2017)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 7/7 Plus (2016)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone SE (2016)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 6s/6s Plus (2014)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 6/6 Plus (2014)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 5s (2013)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 5c (2013)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 5 (2012)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 4s (2011)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 4 (2010)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 3GS (2009)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 3G (2008)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone (2007)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, see our list of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1659017/ios-versions-list.html\">every version of iOS</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://bilder.pcwelt.de/1971997_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPhone 5S: Der Nachfolger iPhone 6 soll im September 2014 auf den Markt kommen\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>The iPhone 5S.

So as long as your iPhone was still being sold by Apple up to seven years ago, the company or a third-party service provider will still service it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201624\">states on its website</a> that “Owners of iPhone, iPad, iPod or Mac products may obtain a service and parts from Apple or Apple service providers for five years after the product is no longer sold.” The following iPhones are considered <strong>Obsolete</strong>, which means sales were discontinued more than seven years ago and Apple has now discontinued all hardware servicing.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 3G</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 3GS</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 4 (certain models are now obsolete)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 4s </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 5c (discontinued September 2013, obsolete in 2021)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 5S (discontinued in 2016, vintage in 2021, obsolete in 2024) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 6 Plus (discontinued in 2016, vintage in 2021, obsolete in 2024)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 6s (32GB) (discontinued in 2018, obsolete in 2024)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 6s Plus (32 GB) (discontinued in 2018, obsolete in 2024)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And the iPhones below are listed as <strong>Vintage</strong>, which means they have not been sold for more than five years (but less than seven years). Apple will still service these products as long as it has the required parts. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 4 8GB (discontinued in 2013, but sold in India until February 2014, likely to be obsolete very soon)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 5 (discontinued September 2013, likely to become obsolete soon)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 6 (discontinued in 2016, vintage in 2021)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 6s (16GB) (discontinued in 2016, vintage in 2022)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 6s Plus (16GB) (discontinued in 2018, vintage in 2022)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone SE, 2016 (discontinued in 2018, vintage in 2023) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 8 (discontinued in 2020, vintage in 2024)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 8 Plus (discontinued in 2020, vintage in 2024)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone X (discontinued in 2018, vintage in 2024)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span>A</span>ll iPhones that followed those handsets should be supported by Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also be interested to learn <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673939/this-is-how-long-macs-and-macbooks-last.html\">how long Apple supports Macs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2035481/how-long-does-apple-support-ipads.html\">how long Apple supports iPads</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is your iPhone slipping into obscurity?
