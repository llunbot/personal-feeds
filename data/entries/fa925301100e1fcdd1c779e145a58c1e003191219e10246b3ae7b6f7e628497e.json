{"title":"Google identifies low noise “phase transition” in its quantum processor","link":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/google-identifies-low-noise-phase-transition-in-its-quantum-processor/","date":1728496708000,"content":"<p>Back in 2019, Google <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/paper-leaks-showing-a-quantum-computer-doing-something-a-supercomputer-cant/\">made waves</a> by claiming it had achieved what has been called \"quantum supremacy\"—the ability of a quantum computer to perform operations that would take a wildly impractical amount of time to simulate on standard computing hardware. That claim proved to be controversial, in that the operations were little more than a benchmark that involved getting the quantum computer to behave like a quantum computer; separately, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/math-may-have-caught-up-with-googles-quantum-supremacy-claims/\">improved ideas</a> about how to perform the simulation on a supercomputer cut the time required down significantly.</p>\n<p>But Google is back with a new exploration of the benchmark, described in a paper published in Nature on Wednesday. It uses the benchmark to identify what it calls a phase transition in the performance of its quantum processor and uses it to identify conditions where the processor can operate with low noise. Taking advantage of that, they again show that, even giving classical hardware every potential advantage, it would take a supercomputer a dozen years to simulate things.</p>\n<h2>Cross entropy benchmarking</h2>\n<p>The benchmark in question involves the performance of what are called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_random_circuits\">quantum random circuits</a>, which involves performing a set of operations on qubits and letting the state of the system evolve over time, so that the output depends heavily on the stochastic nature of measurement outcomes in quantum mechanics. Each qubit will have a probability of producing one of two results, but unless that probability is one, there's no way of knowing which of the results you'll actually get. As a result, the output of the operations will be a string of truly random bits.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/google-identifies-low-noise-phase-transition-in-its-quantum-processor/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/google-identifies-low-noise-phase-transition-in-its-quantum-processor/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fa925301100e1fcdd1c779e145a58c1e003191219e10246b3ae7b6f7e628497e","category":"Tech"}
