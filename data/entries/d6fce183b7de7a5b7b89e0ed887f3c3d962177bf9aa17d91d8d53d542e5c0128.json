{"title":"New – Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized Cluster Configuration with Up to 40% Cost Savings for I/O-Intensive Applications","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-aurora-i-o-optimized-cluster-configuration-with-up-to-40-cost-savings-for-i-o-intensive-applications/","date":1683835624000,"content":"<p>Since <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora\">Amazon Aurora</a> launched in 2014, hundreds of thousands of customers have chosen Aurora to run their most demanding applications. Aurora provides unparalleled high performance and availability at global scale with full MySQL and PostgreSQL compatibility at up to one-tenth the cost of commercial databases.</p> \n<p>Many customers benefit from the cost-effectiveness of Aurora’s current simple, pay-per-request pricing for input/output (I/O) usage, removing the need to provision I/Os in advance. Customers also benefit from additional cost-saving innovations such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/\">Amazon Aurora Serverless v2</a> (ASv2), which provides seamless scaling in fine-grained increments based on the application’s demands. For workloads with spikes in demand, you can save up to 90 percent in costs vs. provisioning capacity for peak load with ASv2.</p> \n<p>Today, we are announcing the general availability of <strong>Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized</strong>, a new cluster configuration that offers improved price performance and predictable pricing for customers with I/O-intensive applications, such as e-commerce applications, payment processing systems, and more. Aurora I/O-Optimized offers improved performance, increasing throughput and reducing latency to support your most demanding workloads.</p> \n<p>You can now confidently predict costs for your most I/O-intensive workloads, with up to 40 percent cost savings when your I/O spend exceeds 25 percent of your current Aurora database spend. If you are using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/\">Reserved Instances</a>, you will see even greater cost savings.</p> \n<p>Now you have the flexibility to choose between the existing configuration newly called <strong>Aurora Standard</strong>, which is the existing pay-per-request pricing model that is cost-effective for applications with low-to-moderate I/O usage or the new <strong>Aurora I/O-Optimized</strong> configuration for I/O-intensive applications.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Getting Started with Aurora I/O-Optimized</u></strong><br /> You can create a new database cluster using the Aurora I/O-Optimized configuration or convert your existing database clusters with a few clicks in the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds\">AWS Management Console</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS Command Line Interface</a> (AWS CLI), or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/\">AWS SDKs</a>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/05/03/2023-aurora-io-optimized-1.jpg\" alt width=\"1666\" height=\"1214\" /></p> \n<p>For the Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition and Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition, you can choose either the <strong>Aurora Standard</strong> or <strong>Aurora I/O-Optimized</strong> configuration.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/05/03/2023-aurora-io-optimized-2.jpg\" alt width=\"933\" height=\"452\" /></p> \n<p>Aurora I/O-Optimized configuration is available in the latest version of Aurora MySQL version 3.03.1 and higher, Aurora PostgreSQL v15.2 and higher, v14.7 and higher, and v13.10 and higher.</p> \n<p>This configuration supports Intel-based Aurora database instance types such as <code>t3</code>, <code>r5</code>, and <code>r6i</code>, Graviton-based database instance types such as <code>t4g</code>, <code>r7g</code>, and <code>x2g</code>, Aurora Serverless v2, Aurora Global Database, on-demand Aurora database instances, and reserved instances.</p> \n<p>R7g instances for Amazon Aurora are powered by the latest generation <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/\">AWS Graviton3</a> processors, delivering up to 30 percent performance gains and up to 20 percent improved price performance for Aurora, as compared to R6g instances.</p> \n<p>In your existing Aurora clusters, you can switch the storage configuration to Aurora I/O-Optimized once every 30 days or switch back to Aurora Standard at any time. You can change the cluster storage configuration only at the cluster level. The change applies to all instances in the cluster.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/05/03/2023-aurora-io-optimized-3.jpg\" alt width=\"964\" height=\"760\" /></p> \n<p>After changing the configuration, you don’t need to reboot the database instances within the cluster to take advantage of the price-performance benefits of Aurora I/O-Optimized.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Now Available</u></strong><br /> Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized configuration is now generally available for Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition and Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition in most <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/\">AWS Regions</a> where Aurora is available, with China (Beijing), China (Ningxia), AWS GovCloud (US-East), and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions coming soon.</p> \n<p>Aurora is billed differently for the two configurations: Aurora Standard or Aurora I/O-Optimized. The latter doesn’t charge for I/Os, charging a set price for compute and storage relative to the former. For I/O-intensive applications, its price/performance will be better, and you can save up to 40 percent on costs.
