But according to new evidence, there may come a time in the not-so-distant future when Mac users won‚Äôt be so immune.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to security research (via <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.wired.com/story/apple-mac-lockbit-ransomware-samples/&amp;xcust=1-1-1791783-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Wired</a>), hackers are putting more effort into creating macOS versions of malware attacks that are prevalent on Windows. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1647384505550876675&amp;xcust=1-1-1791783-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MalwareHunterTeam</a> has found that a collective known as <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.wired.com/story/lockbit-ransomware-attacks/&amp;xcust=1-1-1791783-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">LockBit</a> is working on ransomware encryptors that work on both Macs using Apple M-series chips and Intel processors.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>\"locker_Apple_M1_64\": 3e4bbd21756ae30c24ff7d6942656be024139f8180b7bddd4e5c62a9dfbd8c79<br />As much as I can tell, this is the first Apple's Mac devices targeting build of LockBit ransomware sample seen‚Ä¶<br />Also is this a first for the \"big name\" gangs?<br />ü§î<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/patrickwardle?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1791783-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">@patrickwardle</a><br />cc <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/cyb3rops?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1791783-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">@cyb3rops</a> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/SMuN3Rmodl&amp;xcust=1-1-1791783-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/SMuN3Rmodl</a></p>‚Äî MalwareHunterTeam (@malwrhunterteam) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1647384505550876675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1791783-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 15, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The findings indicate that LockBit is in the early stages of development and may not have ransomware that‚Äôs completely ready to be unleashed. But the collective is working towards that end. ‚ÄúIt would be naive to assume that LockBit won‚Äôt improve and iterate on this ransomware, potentially creating a more effective and destructive version,‚Äù said <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://objective-see.org/blog/blog_0x75.html&amp;xcust=1-1-1791783-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Patrick Wardle</a>, a Mac security researcher, to Wired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wardle told Wired that it appears that LockBit is in the ‚Äúvery early stage‚Äù of its work and they still need to figure out how to get by macOS‚Äôs built-in protection measures. <a href=\"https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100470607-15376698?sid=1-1-1791783-1-0-0&amp;url=https://www.malwarebytes.com/\">Malwarebytes</a>‚Äò Thomas Reed said that ‚Äúthe viability may improve in the future. Or it may not, if their tests aren‚Äôt promising.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple often promotes macOS‚Äôs built-in security measures and validity checks to spread the idea that its Mac operating system is secure. Those are real reasons why malware isn‚Äôt prevalent on Macs, but the major reason (as Wired points out), is that the Mac doesn‚Äôt have an installed base as large as Windows, especially in businesses. With protection practices and counterattacks increasing in the Windows market, malware collectives are looking for fresh targets, and that includes the Mac, which is being used more in businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has protections in place within macOS, but it‚Äôs always a good idea to take an active approach to protect yourself and your Mac.
