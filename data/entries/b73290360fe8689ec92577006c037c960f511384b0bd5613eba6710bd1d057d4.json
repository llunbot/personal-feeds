From the report: \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Apple has a third brain-related research partnership with Duke University that it hasn't disclosed. It aims to create an algorithm to help detect childhood autism, according to the documents and people familiar with the work. The research looks at using the iPhone's camera to observe how young children focus, how often they sway back and forth, and other measures, according to the documents.</blockquote>Biogen, an American biotechnology company, had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/11/biogen-apple-watch-iphone-cognitive-health-study/\">previously announced</a> it was partnering with Apple to study ways to use the ‌iPhone‌ and Apple Watch to notice a cognitive decline in users or potential signs of depression. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIncluding that and Apple's early work in childhood autism detection, the <em>Journal</em> says that these features may never become a user-end feature, but notes that Apple had invested in multiple heart-focused studies before releasing a host of related features on the Apple Watch. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe report notes that as part of Apple's privacy push, the company would ultimately aim to run any algorithms, including those for early detection of childhood autism, locally on a user's device, without needing to send any data collected to the cloud for processing. The report adds that research is still in the early stages, but Apple executives are enthusiastic about its potential. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-wall-street-journal/\">The Wall Street Journal</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/apple-researching-iphone-camera-childhood-autism/\">Apple Researching Ways to Use iPhone Camera to Detect Childhood Autism</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-researching-ways-to-use-iphone-camera-to-detect-childhood-autism.2312276/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=EwisdQuM9j0:aK2h-ESe9UA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=EwisdQuM9j0:aK2h-ESe9UA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/EwisdQuM9j0\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b73290360fe8689ec92577006c037c960f511384b0bd5613eba6710bd1d057d4","category":"Apple"}
