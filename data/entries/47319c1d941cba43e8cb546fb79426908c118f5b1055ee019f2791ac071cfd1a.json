None of these companies have confirmed the reports.</blockquote>The report says that Foxconn, one of Apple's largest suppliers, and Advanced Lithium Electrochemistry, plan to set up plants in the United States, where the ‌Apple Car‌ battery production may take place. While the majority of Apple's products are assembled in China, many components are sourced from suppliers all around the world.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, for example, Apple uses glass made in Kentucky by Corning Glass, while other parts, such as the parts of the camera, are made by suppliers in Japan. With the ‌Apple Car‌, which is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/27/kuo-apple-car-2025-2027-at-earliest/\">still some years away</a>, Apple is likely to take a similar approach to diversify its production supply chain. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes/\">digitimes</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-car-battery-united-states/\">Apple Reportedly Aiming to Manufacture Apple Car Batteries in the United States</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-aiming-to-manufacture-apple-car-batteries-in-the-united-states.2304075/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Kolf-6UdjJc:mU2b2aOsEAE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Kolf-6UdjJc:mU2b2aOsEAE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Kolf-6UdjJc\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"47319c1d941cba43e8cb546fb79426908c118f5b1055ee019f2791ac071cfd1a","category":"Apple"}
