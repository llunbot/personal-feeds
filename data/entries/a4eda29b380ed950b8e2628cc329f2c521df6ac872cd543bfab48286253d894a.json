adventure gravel bike, the Fugio.</p>\n<p>Previously, the Fugio was available as either an aluminium or a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-steel-gravel-bikes/\">steel gravel bike</a>, but the new bike will only be available with an updated 6061 aluminium frame.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the Fugio remains similar to its predecessor, according to Genesis.</p>\n<p>The new Fugio will be available in three models, with prices ranging from £1,299.99 to £1,999.99.</p>\n<h2>Bye-bye steel and hello custom paint</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n
