We also loved the design and display as well as the ability to run two external displays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display this laptop comes with is absolutely gorgeous, with super crisp images, vivid colors, and great brightness. The laptop comes with 16GB of memory and a 512GB SSD, which should be enough for most day-to-day scenarios.
