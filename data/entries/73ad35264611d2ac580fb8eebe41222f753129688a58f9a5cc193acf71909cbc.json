Now modification company ColorWare has a solution to that problem, but it’s going to cost you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to ColorWare’s clever customization, you can <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/collections/colorware-apple-crayon-pros\">get an Apple Pencil Pro in one of seven Crayola crayon-inspired colors</a>: black, mint (green), pink, purple, red, yellow, and white. In addition to the colors, the Pencils look exactly like Crayola crayons with a matte-painted wrapper adorned with the trademark black oval. In a nod to its inspiration, ColorWare cheekily warns, “Do not sharpen.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the unique paint job will cost you. Specifically, it’ll cost you $86 more than the Apple Pencil Pro MSRP. ColorWare charges $215 for one of the new Crayon Pencils, which is something of a bargain over the <a href=\"https://www.colorware.com/products/colorware-apple-number-2-pencil?design=JTdCJTIyYmFzZU1vZGVsJTIyJTNBJTIyJTIyJTJDJTIyY29sb3JzJTIyJTNBJTdCJTdEJTJDJTIyZW5ncmF2aW5ncyUyMiUzQSU3QiU3RCU3RA%3D%3D\">non-Pro Number 2 Pencil</a>, which also sells for $215 but is a mod of the cheaper 2nd-gen Pencil. The $215 MSRP doesn’t include shipping, which varies by location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ColorWare also sells a variety of modified Apple products, including a Mac mini Retro in Light and Dark, starting at $899, a premium of $300 over the standard Mac mini. It’s worth noting that the customization voids the standard Apple warranty, though ColorWare offers its own 1-year parts and labor warranty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested, the Apple Crayon Pros are expected to ship at the end of April.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"73ad35264611d2ac580fb8eebe41222f753129688a58f9a5cc193acf71909cbc","category":"Apple"}
