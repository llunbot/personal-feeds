Well, let’s take a look at the 2020 Milan–San Remo winner’s setup – and some of the potential advantages that might have led to the decision.</p>\n<h2>What’s van Aert running?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s unusual to see a 1x drivetrain in the pro peloton.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wout van Aert / Instagram</i></span></div>\n<p>In pictures posted to his Instagram account, Van Aert reveals he will race on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cervelo-s5-force-etap-axs-review/\">Cervélo S5</a>, but will forgo his typical 2x setup in favour of a 1x <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-12-speed-red-etap-axs-hrd-review/\">SRAM Red eTap AXS</a> electronic groupset.</p>\n<p>Speaking to BikeRadar, a SRAM spokesperson confirmed van Aert would run a 52 tooth chainring paired with an 11-28 tooth cassette.</p>\n<p>He also appears to be using a chain guide.</p>\n<h2>Why Milan–San Remo?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Milan San-Remo route features relatively little climbing, despite being nearly 300km in length.</span></figcaption><span> <i>RCS</i></span></div>\n<p>That’s a big gear, but Milan–San Remo is a notably fast race with no steep climbs of note, and, as a result, van Aert is unlikely to miss the wider choice of gears presented by a 2x setup.</p>\n<p>It’s a route suited, on paper at least, to a 1x drivetrain, particularly given the fact that the latest road <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleurs</a> can accommodate a wide-ranging cassette.</p>\n<p>La Primavera is sometimes described as an opera, with a slow build of tension before exploding into life on the climb of the Poggio on the outskirts of San Remo in the northwest corner of Italy.</p>\n<p>The opening 100km of the 294km race passes without note, and even then the long, gradual climb of the Passo del Turchino (532m) poses no challenge to the peloton.</p>\n<p>Another 100km of largely flat roads follow before the three small climbs of the Capo Mele, Cervo and Berta in quick succession, as the race enters the final 50km.</p>\n<p>The Cipressa (5.6km at 4.1 per cent) comes with 22km remaining before the often decisive ascent of the Poggio (3.7km at 3.7 per cent). It’s a big-ring climb, ridden at breakneck speed, and van Aert will have no need for a small chainring.</p>\n<p>It’s here that a small, select group of riders is likely to form ahead of the technical, rollercoaster descent and flat 2km run-in to the finish.</p>\n<h2>What are the potential advantages of a 1x setup at Milan–San Remo?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ditching the relatively bulky SRAM Red AXS front derailleur (pictured here on a bike that’s not Wout van Aert’s) could present a slight aerodynamic advantage.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>We’ve already covered the fact that a 1x setup is likely to provide all the gearing range a rider like van Aert will need. It’s not a setup that will suit every rider but the Belgian has no doubt done his homework.</p>\n<p>In theory, a 1x setup could also be slightly more aerodynamic.</p>\n<p>SRAM eTap AXS front derailleurs are relatively big and, given the high speeds of the race, there’s a small saving to be made here.</p>\n<p>Running a chain guide diminishes those potential aero advantages slightly, but that comes with advantages of its own.</p>\n<p>On that note, chain security may be part of van Aert’s thinking, too.</p>\n<p>Speaking to BikeRadar, Michael Valgren (EF Education–EasyPost) said that, although he crested the Poggio (the race’s critical final climb) in the front group of 10-15 riders in last year’s race, a dropped chain at the top of the descent spelt the end of his day.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, there is no chance of a mistimed front shift with 1x and the ability to run a chain guide boosts chain security.</p>\n<p>Finally, there’s a small weight saving from losing the front derailleur.</p>\n<hr /><p>Update – Belgian website <a href=\"https://www.hln.be/wielrennen/kleine-winst-die-we-wel-willen-pakken-wout-van-aert-kiest-in-milaan-sanremo-voor-enkel-voorblad~a2d0fbc1/\" target=\"_blank\">HLN</a> has reported van Aert as saying: “I won’t need an inner chainring. Moreover, this is faster and more aerodynamic. Lighter, too. Since this year we have had that option thanks to SRAM. A small profit that we want to take.” <em>(Editor’s note: We are relying on Google Translate for the translation here).</em></p>\n<p>Van Aert refers to Jumbo–Visma’s switch from Shimano to SRAM as the team’s groupset sponsor in January – one of the major sponsor changes on this season’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>SRAM has been the major force behind 1x, introducing the first 1x groupset for mountain bikes <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/sram-xx1-component-development-and-details/\">in the form of XX1 in 2012</a>.</p>\n<p>In the decade since, SRAM has led the wholesale adoption of 1x in mountain biking, while also developing single-ring options for road cycling, cyclocross and gravel.</p>\n<hr /><h2>1x groupsets in road racing – a short history</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Aqua Blue Sport experimented with 1x drivetrains back in 2018.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Marc Gasch/Aqua Blue Sport</i></span></div>\n<p>Outside of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/10-steps-to-your-best-ever-time-trial/\">time trials</a>, 1x drivetrains have had <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/1x-drivetrains-in-the-pro-peloton-im-sceptical/\">a chequered history</a> on the road.</p>\n<p>Former Aqua Blue Sport rider turned pundit Adam Blythe pinned the team’s downfall to its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/aqua-blue-sport-take-first-victory-on-3t-strada/\">early adoption of 1x drivetrains</a>.</p>\n<p>Sub-optimal gearing options that significantly disrupted <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/what-is-cycling-cadence/\">cadence</a> when shifting and limited range were the two most common complaints from riders on the team.</p>\n\n<p>However, 1x drivetrains on road bikes have gone through a very small-scale renaissance in recent years, primarily in races run on flatter parcours.</p>\n<p>On that note, it’s worth noting that this isn’t the first time we’ve seen a 1x setup at the Classics.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/lizzie-deignan-paris-roubaix-femmes/\">Lizzie Deignan’s win at the inaugural Paris-Roubaix Femmes</a> in 2022 is the biggest win in recent memory.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Lizzie Deignan used a 1x drivetrain to win Paris-Roubaix Femmes in 2021.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Though not strictly a 1x setup, Victor Campenaerts has been experimenting with single-ring drivetrains paired with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/classified-parcours-partnership/\">Classified two-speed hub</a>.</p>\n<p>And, as we’ve already alluded to, an increasing number of riders have been running 1x drivetrains in time trials.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 1x drivetrains have become increasingly common on pro-level time trial bikes.
