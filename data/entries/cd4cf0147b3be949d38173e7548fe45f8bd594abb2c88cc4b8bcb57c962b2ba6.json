Today, the Indiana-based company announced the launch of a new advanced formula, <a href=\"https://alnk.to/dWe9BaC\" target=\"_blank\">Synergetic Race Grease</a> ($25),designed to elevate the performance and longevity of modern bicycle components…</em><span></span></p>\n<p>Building on the success of their award-winning Synergetic Chain Lubricant, Synergetic Race Grease combines the low friction properties of oil-based lubricants with the pressure capabilities and wear resistance of thicker assembly greases.</p>\n<p>This pro-level grease is engineered utilizing the same Type-V ultra-synthetic oil base used in Synergetic Chain Lube, thickened into a grease using the synthetic wax technology from SpeedChip, paired with the low-friction WS2 additive package used in both. The resulting low viscosity grease offers higher longevity and performance for bearings, bushings, suspension pivots, threaded assemblies, and press-fit interfaces.</p>\n<p><strong>Key benefits of Synergetic Race Grease include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Up to 50% Reduction in Friction:</b> Improves mechanical efficiency in bearings and bushings.</li>\n<li><b>Up to 90% Reduction in Wear:</b> Extends the operational life of precision components.</li>\n<li><b>Extreme Load Stability:</b> Resists displacement under heavy use, reducing maintenance intervals.</li>\n<li><b>Friction Characteristics</b>: Optimized for both sliding and rotational surfaces.</li>\n<li><b>Torque Control:</b> Enables consistent clamping forces without over-tightening when used as assembly grease.</li>\n<li><b>Formulation Purity:</b> Free of unnecessary dyes or additives that could compromise interface integrity.</li>\n<li><b>Made in the USA. </b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://alnk.to/dWe9BaC\" target=\"_blank\">Silca</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/silca-synergetic-race-grease/\">Silca Synergetic Race Grease</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"cd4cf0147b3be949d38173e7548fe45f8bd594abb2c88cc4b8bcb57c962b2ba6","category":"Cycling"}
