Both devices look a lot like their black-and-white predecessors, the Kobo Libra 2 and Kobo Clara 2E, but with colorful screens instead of black-and-white ones.</p>\n<p>Kobo is also refreshing the black-and-white version of the Clara, called the <a href=\"https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-clara-bw\">Clara BW</a> to distinguish it from the color model. It's mostly identical to the old Clara 2E model, but with the faster dual-core processor from the color models. It sells for $129.99, $10 cheaper than the Clara 2E.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015994#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015994&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"15ac899ead95bb38bcc68cdf85533746289abe1e176ea42735531cb38ebd48ea","category":"Tech"}
