The past couple years have already shown us more mountain bikes filling that space between XC &amp; enduro – like the latest <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-yt-jeffsy-v3-0-mtb-is-a-better-friend-as-an-all-rounder-trail-bike-first-rides-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeffsy</a> or even <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-rides-review-canyon-spectral-125/\">Spectral 125</a>. Slack geometries like on enduro bikes but lighter and much shorter travel. Not all of us can afford to keep a fleet of multiple mountain bikes from XC hardtails to mega DH sleds. Especially, when many of our purse strings have tightened in the past year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A mid-travel modern Trail bike could just be the perfect bike for the kind of riding most mountain bikers actually ride. And we think the bike makers have been paying attention to our real needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gravel Race Bikes give rise to MTB-inspired Gravel Bikes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2024-Merida-Silex-versatile-all-rounder-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-in-Italy.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2024-Merida-Silex-versatile-all-rounder-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-in-Italy.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Merida Silex versatile all-rounder carbon gravel bikes, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2024-Merida-Silex-versatile-all-rounder-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-in-Italy.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2024-Merida-Silex-versatile-all-rounder-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-in-Italy-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2024-Merida-Silex-versatile-all-rounder-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-in-Italy-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2024-Merida-Silex-versatile-all-rounder-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-in-Italy-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2024-Merida-Silex-versatile-all-rounder-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-in-Italy-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2024-Merida-Silex-versatile-all-rounder-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-in-Italy-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2024-Merida-Silex-versatile-all-rounder-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-in-Italy-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2024-Merida-Silex-versatile-all-rounder-carbon-gravel-bike_riding-in-Italy-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>2024 is going to see more and more gravel bikes with full-on mountain biking capabilities. This won’t be a huge surprise to our readers who’ve been seeing short-travel <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=gravel+suspension\" target=\"_blank\">gravel suspension</a> forks &amp; even full-suspension gravel bikes on our site for literal years. But as gravel racing develops its professional side, adventure gravel bikes are becoming seriously differentiated from race-focused gravel bikes. And the same modern MTB geometry that started in enduro before trickling down to XC… it’s coming to gravel too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, even last year’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pro-bike-check-teaser-unreleased-merida-silex-of-gravel-world-champ-matej-mohoric/\" target=\"_blank\">Gravel Worlds</a> was won on a long-wheelbase gravel bike with a headtube maybe 3° slacker than some of the competition. You don’t need to build a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cyber-grawumm-steel-gravel-mountain-bike-x-agresti-frameworks/\">retro-modern MTB gravel</a> bike to know that modern gravel rides are more capable than early mountain bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Even Road Racing Bikes are now All-Road Bikes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_all-surface-riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1597\" height=\"1063\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_all-surface-riding.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Focus Paralane carbon aero all-road bike, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_all-surface-riding.jpg 1597w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_all-surface-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_all-surface-riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_all-surface-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_all-surface-riding-768x511.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_all-surface-riding-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-Focus-Paralane-carbon-aero-all-road-bike_all-surface-riding-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Road bikes that you can only ride on smooth asphalt are passé. Unless you are racing the Tour de France, who needs a skinny tire road bike anyway? And all the real-world testing data supports the rolling resistance science that wider, larger volume tires are faster anyway. Come on, even le Tour will take on a gravel stage (#9in Troyes) in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can’t tell me that a road bike with 32mm tire clearance is not an all-road bike. 1 more millimeter, and it would be a cyclocross bike!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aero Integrated Everything</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_one-piece-Sphyr-cockpit.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_one-piece-Sphyr-cockpit.jpg\" alt=\"J-Laverack Aston Martin .1R bespoke carbon &amp; titanium road bike, made in the UK, luxury custom and fully integrated cokcpit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_one-piece-Sphyr-cockpit.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_one-piece-Sphyr-cockpit-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_one-piece-Sphyr-cockpit-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_one-piece-Sphyr-cockpit-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_one-piece-Sphyr-cockpit-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_one-piece-Sphyr-cockpit-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/J-Laverack-Aston-Martin-1R-bespoke-UK-made-carbon-titanium-road-bike_luxury-custom-and-fully-integrated_one-piece-Sphyr-cockpit-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re shopping for a new bike, especially on the dropbar side of life, you’re already hip to this. Nearly all bikes are getting the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-2023-trek-madone-slr-aero-road-bike/\">one-piece cockpit</a> and<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/trek-madone-sl-gen-7-road-race-bike-rsl-aero-bar/\"> internal cable routing </a>makeover. Many bikes (even like the cyclocross <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-canyon-inflite-cfr-cx-gets-internal-cable-routing-and-more/\">Canyon Inflite</a>) are exactly the same as the previous version but with fully internal cable routing and fewer outside holes in the frame. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This “aero everything” isn’t (<em>hopefully</em>) just a cash grab for bike manufacturers but a way to improve the bikes’ looks and add some aero benefits. When you eliminate cables from the front of a bike and integrate the cockpit, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cannondale-evo-road-bike-lab71-15k/\">aerodynamic benefits are undeniable</a>. That said, the technology and aero-advantage come at a real serviceability cost to the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now — I am a fan of a clean-looking setup, but if I’m servicing a headset or changing the brake hose… I’m going to drop a few swears. So, let’s hope that this wave of clean internal routing comes with a resurgence in some more user-friendly designs. One that will let the home mechanic be free to make changes without bleeding a brake to change a headset bearing or take out a stack spacer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Thule-Kids-Car-Seats-and-Dog-Transport-plans_bike-trailer-puppy-conversion.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1100\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Thule-Kids-Car-Seats-and-Dog-Transport-plans_bike-trailer-puppy-conversion.jpg\" alt=\"Thule Kids' Car Seats and Dog Transport plans, bike trailer puppy upgrade\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Thule-Kids-Car-Seats-and-Dog-Transport-plans_bike-trailer-puppy-conversion.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Thule-Kids-Car-Seats-and-Dog-Transport-plans_bike-trailer-puppy-conversion-297x272.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Thule-Kids-Car-Seats-and-Dog-Transport-plans_bike-trailer-puppy-conversion-800x733.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Thule-Kids-Car-Seats-and-Dog-Transport-plans_bike-trailer-puppy-conversion-120x110.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Thule-Kids-Car-Seats-and-Dog-Transport-plans_bike-trailer-puppy-conversion-768x704.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While we are on the topic of aero cockpits, dramatically narrower road handlebars are seriously coming too. And road race bars with gravel-like flare and creative bends – all in a bid to get more aero. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI first outlawed puppy paws, and then those ugly turned-in levers, which were confirmed to be sketchy, too. Unsurprisingly, installing a metal clamp on a thin carbon tube at a dramatic angle far away from what was designed… did in fact, create some nasty stress risers and result in broken handlebars. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But roadies will still want to get into that narrow aero tuck. So, we think the cockpit sponsors are working overtime to redesign some narrow but flared drop bars that will give pro riders that same narrow, aero position on the bike. The UCI did say they would allow turned in levers if the manufacturers showed that the bars were designed to handle it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shimano <strong>XTR Di2</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rotor-InSpider-power-meter-spider-for-direct-mount-Shimano-mountain-bike-crankset_XTR-crank-power-meter.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rotor-InSpider-power-meter-spider-for-direct-mount-Shimano-mountain-bike-crankset_XTR-crank-power-meter.jpg\" alt=\"Rotor InSpider power meter spider for direct mount Shimano mountain bike crankset, XTR power meters\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rotor-InSpider-power-meter-spider-for-direct-mount-Shimano-mountain-bike-crankset_XTR-crank-power-meter.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rotor-InSpider-power-meter-spider-for-direct-mount-Shimano-mountain-bike-crankset_XTR-crank-power-meter-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rotor-InSpider-power-meter-spider-for-direct-mount-Shimano-mountain-bike-crankset_XTR-crank-power-meter-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rotor-InSpider-power-meter-spider-for-direct-mount-Shimano-mountain-bike-crankset_XTR-crank-power-meter-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rotor-InSpider-power-meter-spider-for-direct-mount-Shimano-mountain-bike-crankset_XTR-crank-power-meter-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rotor-InSpider-power-meter-spider-for-direct-mount-Shimano-mountain-bike-crankset_XTR-crank-power-meter-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rotor-InSpider-power-meter-spider-for-direct-mount-Shimano-mountain-bike-crankset_XTR-crank-power-meter-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re big fans of the current <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-ride-shimano-xtr-m9100-12-speed-in-both-xc-enduro-1x12-builds/\" target=\"_blank\">XTR 9100 groupset</a>; it’s reliable, shifts supremely well, is lightweight, and never runs out of batteries. But it’s 5 1/2 years old now. And… there’s this little voice inside our head that’s like, “A new XTR Di2 would be awesome.” Considering what’s happening with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-deore-xt-di2-mtb-ebike-drivetrain-new-ep6-ep8-drive-units-auto-shift-free-shift/\">XT Di2 exclusively for e-bikes</a>, I feel something could be in the works. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What would it look like? </em>I’m guessing that Shimano would bring the same tech from the new Di2 road line with zero wires on the front end. Now that integrated bars/stems are a thing even on mountain bikes (<em>see above</em>), I wouldn’t be surprised if the new lever points slightly inward to accommodate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Would it stay at 12 speed or go to 13?</em> I think 12-speed is the max until we go all-in for Super Boost rear as the standard. The XT Di2 is 12-speed (<em>or curiously 11sp <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-emtb-autoshift-freeshift-stuns-powered-by-linkglide-xt-di2-review/\" target=\"_blank\">to get AutoShift</a></em>), and I can’t see Shimano going to 13-speed with just a single groupset. But it is an Olympic year… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I’d be game for a 13-speed mountain bike drive train that shifts, as well as Dura-Ace Di2!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Btw, please give it a neatly integrated power meter, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>GRX Di2 has to be getting 12-speed as well, right?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shimano-GRX-12-speed-custom-build-Otso-Warakin-Titanium-gravel-bike-04.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shimano-GRX-12-speed-custom-build-Otso-Warakin-Titanium-gravel-bike-04.jpg\" alt=\"Shimano GRX 12 speed crankset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shimano-GRX-12-speed-custom-build-Otso-Warakin-Titanium-gravel-bike-04.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shimano-GRX-12-speed-custom-build-Otso-Warakin-Titanium-gravel-bike-04-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shimano-GRX-12-speed-custom-build-Otso-Warakin-Titanium-gravel-bike-04-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shimano-GRX-12-speed-custom-build-Otso-Warakin-Titanium-gravel-bike-04-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shimano-GRX-12-speed-custom-build-Otso-Warakin-Titanium-gravel-bike-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shimano-GRX-12-speed-custom-build-Otso-Warakin-Titanium-gravel-bike-04-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shimano-GRX-12-speed-custom-build-Otso-Warakin-Titanium-gravel-bike-04-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Shimano-GRX-12-speed-custom-build-Otso-Warakin-Titanium-gravel-bike-04-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s dive into some groupset-specific predictions, too. Remember, gravel is the new road. (<em>Even if old roads, were actually gravel!</em>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look, Shimano debuted new 12-speed 1x and 2x mechanical GRX groupsets for gravel riders this past fall, but not GRX Di2?! That surely wasn’t an oversight. Even if it is more expensive, contemporary cyclists love electronic shifting. Dura-Ace has it. Ultegra has it. Hell, 105 has it. Shimano has to be giving GRX Di2 a bigger 12-speed overhaul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose it will be of course be wireless. But with no real need for a front derailleur in the group now that GRX 12 covers 10-51T cassette range… I would bet that the next GRX Di2 ditches all the wires and internal batteries. Finally, a Shimano rear derailleur that you just bolt onto the hanger and ride away!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New SRAM Red, too, because it’s just time for a refresh</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRAM-RED-eTap-AXS-shifter-levers-tech-details08-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRAM-RED-eTap-AXS-shifter-levers-tech-details08-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRAM-RED-eTap-AXS-shifter-levers-tech-details08-1.jpg 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRAM-RED-eTap-AXS-shifter-levers-tech-details08-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRAM-RED-eTap-AXS-shifter-levers-tech-details08-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRAM-RED-eTap-AXS-shifter-levers-tech-details08-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRAM-RED-eTap-AXS-shifter-levers-tech-details08-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRAM-RED-eTap-AXS-shifter-levers-tech-details08-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRAM-RED-eTap-AXS-shifter-levers-tech-details08-1-630x420.jpg 630w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’ll certainly be wireless, and I’m sure still be backwards AXS compatible. Thank you SRAM, for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> It’ll probably still be 12-speed right? Although, why not ‘make the leap’ to 13? No one has done that on the road yet. What I really hope to see is a return to superlight weights. Red mechanical was the lightest groupset out there, and then came hydraulic disc brakes and we all kind of accepted that top groupsets would weight more. And that the weight differences between SRAM, Shimano &amp; Campagnolo kinda disappeared. Both Shimano &amp; Campy re-upped their top groups in recent years, without shedding weight. Now it the time for SRAM to stamp their foot down and to make weight weenies rejoice again!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, a new Red most likely will usher in a new era of computer integration thanks to SRAM’s buyout of Hammerhead back in 2022. That almost certainly suggests a new computer will launch at the same time as SRAM’s top-tier road bike groupset. What will new Red x Hammerhead integration give us? Gearing &amp; battery indicators? Live power visualization? Low tire pressure warnings? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell us what you want an integrated computer to tell you, down in the comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More lightweight eBike motors</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/EP801_2_DU-heat-resistence-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/EP801_2_DU-heat-resistence-Large.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/EP801_2_DU-heat-resistence-Large.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/EP801_2_DU-heat-resistence-Large-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/EP801_2_DU-heat-resistence-Large-800x450.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/EP801_2_DU-heat-resistence-Large-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/EP801_2_DU-heat-resistence-Large-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/EP801_2_DU-heat-resistence-Large-400x225.jpeg 400w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There has to be a new lightweight Shimano ebike powertrain system in the works. It’s been quite a while since EP8 had more than simple internal updates. And now that Bosch has dominated eEnduro racing with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bosch-cx-race-limited-edition-motor-gets-exclusive-400-assist-race-mode/\" target=\"_blank\">Race-mode</a>, while <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=tq\" target=\"_blank\">TQ</a> is crushing it in the lightweight side of ebiking. Shimano has to do something to regain that ebike spark – whether it goes max power or ultralight is anyone’s guess. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My money is on lightweight. Max power ebikes have pretty much hit a wall of legal limitation before they become e-motorcycles, so the big moves have just been in increasing battery capacity. But TQ has proven that if you can make a light, compact &amp; smooth ebike motor, everyone from roadies to XC racers will flock to it if it is unobtrusive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3D-printing will surpass CNC-machining</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Silca-3D-printed-titanium-derailleur-hanger-shifting-upgrade_nested-options.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Silca-3D-printed-titanium-derailleur-hanger-shifting-upgrade_nested-options.jpg\" alt=\"Silca 3D-printed titanium derailleur hanger shifting upgrade, nested parts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Silca-3D-printed-titanium-derailleur-hanger-shifting-upgrade_nested-options.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Silca-3D-printed-titanium-derailleur-hanger-shifting-upgrade_nested-options-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Silca-3D-printed-titanium-derailleur-hanger-shifting-upgrade_nested-options-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Silca-3D-printed-titanium-derailleur-hanger-shifting-upgrade_nested-options-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Silca-3D-printed-titanium-derailleur-hanger-shifting-upgrade_nested-options-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Silca-3D-printed-titanium-derailleur-hanger-shifting-upgrade_nested-options-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we see plastic, rubber, carbon, titanium, stainless steel, and aluminum alloys all being 3D-printed, why do we even need CNC-machining anymore? We know that’s a little rhetorical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure 3D-printing has limitations, but it is still such a young technology. The optimized hollow construction possibilities are nearly limitless. And the power of artificial intelligence can actually be put to good use here in optimizing where the material is placed for strength &amp; efficiency. Plus, you only pay for the material you use, so there’s a lot less waste material that needs to be scrapped or recycled like in machining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every year we hear promises of fully 3D-printed bikes. But 2024 looks like a year that will see even more adoption of 3D-printing on a huge scale. We’ve not yet reviewed a 3D-printed production bike. But we’re ready to do it this year!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Extremely Cool Olympic Track Bikes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eurobike-2023-bicycle-industry-tradeshow_Aero-Design-Swiss-track-bikes.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eurobike-2023-bicycle-industry-tradeshow_Aero-Design-Swiss-track-bikes.jpg\" alt=\"Eurobike 2023, the largest cycling industry trade show, Aero Design Swiss track bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eurobike-2023-bicycle-industry-tradeshow_Aero-Design-Swiss-track-bikes.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eurobike-2023-bicycle-industry-tradeshow_Aero-Design-Swiss-track-bikes-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eurobike-2023-bicycle-industry-tradeshow_Aero-Design-Swiss-track-bikes-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eurobike-2023-bicycle-industry-tradeshow_Aero-Design-Swiss-track-bikes-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eurobike-2023-bicycle-industry-tradeshow_Aero-Design-Swiss-track-bikes-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eurobike-2023-bicycle-industry-tradeshow_Aero-Design-Swiss-track-bikes-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eurobike-2023-bicycle-industry-tradeshow_Aero-Design-Swiss-track-bikes-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Every Olympic year, it happens, and we love it.

But ever since Dugast production <a href=\"https://a-dugast.com/blogs/news/vittoria-group-transforms-legacy-a-new-chapter-for-a-dugast\" target=\"_blank\">moved to Thailand in 2023</a>, the once tubular-only Belgian brand has produced clincher tires. These new<a href=\"https://a-dugast.com/collections/cross-clincher\"> tubeless (TLR) clinchers</a> are available in cyclocross tread patterns and in Dugast cotton casing. Cotton casing isn’t the best for gravel, but they’d have a winner if it were slightly tweaked to be more puncture-resistant (without sacrificing ride quality). Dugast already has the technology to make more giant tire treads. They currently offer 35 &amp; 38-mm cyclocross tubulars, and made 50mm XC tubulars in the recent past. For 2024, we will likely see some Dugast gravel tires with a dry/sand cyclocross tread and a newly redefined, more resistant cotton casing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Return to Metal Bikes</strong> – whether that is aluminum or steel</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Standert-Kettensage-aluminum-gravel-race-bike_made-in-italy_photo-by-Conny-Mirbach_SLT-headset.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Standert-Kettensage-aluminum-gravel-race-bike_made-in-italy_photo-by-Conny-Mirbach_SLT-headset.jpg\" alt=\"Standert Kettensage aluminum gravel race bike, made-in-italy, photo by Conny Mirbach, SLT headset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Standert-Kettensage-aluminum-gravel-race-bike_made-in-italy_photo-by-Conny-Mirbach_SLT-headset.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Standert-Kettensage-aluminum-gravel-race-bike_made-in-italy_photo-by-Conny-Mirbach_SLT-headset-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Standert-Kettensage-aluminum-gravel-race-bike_made-in-italy_photo-by-Conny-Mirbach_SLT-headset-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Standert-Kettensage-aluminum-gravel-race-bike_made-in-italy_photo-by-Conny-Mirbach_SLT-headset-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Standert-Kettensage-aluminum-gravel-race-bike_made-in-italy_photo-by-Conny-Mirbach_SLT-headset-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Standert-Kettensage-aluminum-gravel-race-bike_made-in-italy_photo-by-Conny-Mirbach_SLT-headset-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Standert-Kettensage-aluminum-gravel-race-bike_made-in-italy_photo-by-Conny-Mirbach_SLT-headset-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Round-tube classic-looking bikes are fantastic no matter how you cut them.

Probably hone some technical skills along the way, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Smiles Per Hour not Miles Per Hour</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Vitus-Mythique-Kids-affordable-alloy-120mm-full-suspension-youth-trail-mountain-bikes-with-24-or-26-inch-wheels_riding-smile.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Vitus-Mythique-Kids-affordable-alloy-120mm-full-suspension-youth-trail-mountain-bikes-with-24-or-26-inch-wheels_riding-smile.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Vitus Mythique Kids affordable alloy 120mm full-suspension youth trail mountain bikes with 24&quot; or 26&quot; wheels, riding smiles\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Vitus-Mythique-Kids-affordable-alloy-120mm-full-suspension-youth-trail-mountain-bikes-with-24-or-26-inch-wheels_riding-smile.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Vitus-Mythique-Kids-affordable-alloy-120mm-full-suspension-youth-trail-mountain-bikes-with-24-or-26-inch-wheels_riding-smile-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Vitus-Mythique-Kids-affordable-alloy-120mm-full-suspension-youth-trail-mountain-bikes-with-24-or-26-inch-wheels_riding-smile-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Vitus-Mythique-Kids-affordable-alloy-120mm-full-suspension-youth-trail-mountain-bikes-with-24-or-26-inch-wheels_riding-smile-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Vitus-Mythique-Kids-affordable-alloy-120mm-full-suspension-youth-trail-mountain-bikes-with-24-or-26-inch-wheels_riding-smile-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Vitus-Mythique-Kids-affordable-alloy-120mm-full-suspension-youth-trail-mountain-bikes-with-24-or-26-inch-wheels_riding-smile-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Vitus-Mythique-Kids-affordable-alloy-120mm-full-suspension-youth-trail-mountain-bikes-with-24-or-26-inch-wheels_riding-smile-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been enjoying watching a resurgence of people riding their bikes like they were kids again. There is a newfound focus on non-competitive cycling, and I couldn’t be happier. Look, the fact of the matter is that most cyclists don’t race their bicycles regularly. So, it’s nice to see parts of the bike industry start to recognize and produce goods that are designed around having fun on a bike, not just being competitive on one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am hoping that this trend continues to grow and we see it get to the point where it needs to be. Where we see more and more products, people, bikes, and news focused on the non-competitive side of cycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fingers crossed!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/whats-coming-in-2024-bikerumor-staff-predictions-for-bike-tech-in-the-new-year/\">What’s coming in 2024?
