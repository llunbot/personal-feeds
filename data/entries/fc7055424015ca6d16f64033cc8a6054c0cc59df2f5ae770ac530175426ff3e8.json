If you have a rear or front rack, why not run a pannier over a lashed, structureless bag? Panniers are great for many reasons, mainly their ease of loading and stability. They don’t flop all over or rub your tires on smaller frames like bikepacking bags tend to, and if they’re packed and mounted right, they stay out of your way during the inevitable hike-a-bike. Plus, depending on how you load your rear rack, you can still use a dropper post. </em></p>\n<p><em>John recently took the new <a href=\"https://www.revelatedesigns.com/index.cfm/store.catalog/cargo/NanoPanniers\" target=\"_blank\">Revelate Nano Panniers</a> ($250/pair) out on the Northern New Mexico CDT for four days of navigating deadfall, battling cow shit, and being trounced by Southwestern Monsoons, i.e., the true test of a pannier’s reliability!</em></p>\n<p><em>Read on for his well-used review!</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-68.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-68.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-68.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-68.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-68.jpg?resize=1800,1202&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-68.jpg?resize=1335,891&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-68.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-68.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Revelate Nano Pannier Overview</h3>\n<p>The Nano Pannier is Revelate’s newest offering, intended for rough and rugged off-road touring. They’re only 4″ wide, which keeps your overall width down, feature velcro/Voile Nano lashing, and have a rigid compression strap to help these Challenge Sailcloth bags retain their structure. To offer a frame-like rigidity, Revelate uses a fiberglass stiffened high-density foam frame sheet to give each bag an internal structure. This also works with the external compression system to transfer the load directly to the rack.</p>\n<p>Empty, the Nano Panniers weigh a scant 18 oz per pair, including the straps, and are designed to carry heavy items you’d use on an off-road tour. While Revelate says the Nano Panniers are *not suited for T-racks, I ignored this and found a clever hack…</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reported Weight: Pair: 18 oz / 510 g</li>\n<li>Weight as Received: 18 oz</li>\n<li>Volume: 7-11 L each side</li>\n<li>Materials: Challenge Sailcloth 200 denier UHMWPE / Polyester woven with PET film lamination</li>\n<li>Asymmetric: meaning each pannier is designed to fit either the right or left side of your rack.</li>\n<li>Super tough rattle-free mounting with metal hardware.

Modern off-road tourers have geometry numbers that facilitate this loading style, but this often works counter to the demands of the terrain.</p>\n<p>For instance, proper low-rider pannier racks put panniers very low to the ground, which can cause pannier interference when riding deep-cut singletrack. As such, modern off-road setups need to have the panniers slightly higher when used on singletrack tours, much like how the Nano Panniers sit on my Tumbleweed T-Rack.</p>\n<p><em>When you load your panniers as such, they are not only out of the way of rocks, deadfall, or plant matter, but they are also out of your way when you have to hike-a-bike.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1668\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT_Bikepack_Neopan-9.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT_Bikepack_Neopan-9.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT_Bikepack_Neopan-9.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT_Bikepack_Neopan-9.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT_Bikepack_Neopan-9.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT_Bikepack_Neopan-9.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT_Bikepack_Neopan-9.jpg?resize=1335,891&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT_Bikepack_Neopan-9.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT_Bikepack_Neopan-9.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT_Bikepack_Neopan-9.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photo of the Desert Moose in action by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hinterlanded/\" target=\"_blank\">Kyle Klain</a></em></p>\n<p>Nano Panniers sit high on a rear rack, which means if you pack them with heavy items as Revelate recommends, they can cause the rear of your bike to want to sway when out of your saddle. Instead, I placed heavy items, like my 3L water bladder or camp stove, in my lower frame bag and filled the Nano Panniers with my sleeping bag, tent, down clothing, and placed my breakfast items (fruit and grains) at the bottom of one of the panniers.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-41.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-41.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-41.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-41.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-41.jpg?resize=1800,1202&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-41.jpg?resize=1335,891&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-41.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-41.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I made sure to mount the bags far enough back on the rack to avoid the heel rub of my size 12.5 shoes. This was also a good measurement to ensure I had enough space to push my bike up steep hills. By placing my body adjacent to the frame bag, in front of the panniers, and behind the handlebars, I had enough room to heft the bike uphill, without hitting my legs on the panniers. Something that would be much harder to do with a low-rider setup on the rear.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-11.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-11.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-11.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-11.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-11.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-10.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-10.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-10.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-10.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-10.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-10.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>“Waterproofing” and Loading</h3>\n<p>Unlike your favorite Ortlieb panniers, these bags are not waterproof and are designed to stay affixed to your rack, rather than be lifted off upon arrival at camp. Think of them as ultralight carriers, rather than typical touring panniers. Once you have your rack mounted to your frame, loop the velcro straps around the horizontal rack member and secure the hook and loop strap.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-12.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-12.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-12.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-12.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-12.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-12.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-12.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Then go to the bottom Voile Nano strap and loop it either through the rack legs, or around the seat stay and rack leg if you’re using a T-rack. I found the latter to be ideal, but for illustrative purposes, I mounted them strictly to the T-rack leg to showcase how they are indeed secure on such a rack. Check to see if the panniers are secure, and then move to the next step.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-48.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-48.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-48.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-48.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-48.jpg?resize=1800,1202&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-48.jpg?resize=1335,891&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-48.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-48.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-18.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-18.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-18.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-18.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-18.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-18.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-18.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>My preferred method for the Nano Panniers was to use 20L ultralight dry bags from Sea to Summit, inserted into the pannier, and then use these bags as a compression sack, which made closing the panniers even easier. By pushing all the air out of the dry bags, the Nano Panniers have to do less work when you close them up. It also makes it super easy to unpack at camp.

A 40º bag, a down jacket, merino leggings, and a bivy or tent will suffice, with monsoon rains being the only wildcard, often requiring rain gear and a rain fly.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-52.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-52.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-52.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-52.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-52.jpg?resize=1800,1202&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-52.jpg?resize=1335,891&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-52.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-52.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>The CDT is superb for a bike tour because of the ecotonal shifts, ranging from alpine to aspen trails, New Mexico Blue Spruce, Douglas Fir forests, and eventually, a ripping descent through the semi-arid-steppe surrounding Abiquiu.</em></p>\n<p>This might sound dreamy, but there are several factors working against you.

I am beyond impressed at how well they held up.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-20.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-20.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-20.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-20.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-20.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-20.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-20.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Upon arriving home, I took them off, unloaded them, and documented them as they were to show potential wear spots.</em></p>\n<p>Would they survive a longer singletrack tour? I’d say so, 100%. The only visible wear is from the rack structure, particularly where one of the cargo cage bosses rubbed on the backside, yet it did not tear the fabric. This wear mark can be avoided by adding mastic tape (commonly used as a chainstay protector) to the rack legs themselves to enhance the lifespan of these panniers. Overall, the pannier material has neither snag nor tear.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-19.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-19.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-19.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-19.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-19.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-19.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/07/Revelate-Nano-Panniers-Well-Used-Review-19.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Wrap-Up and TL;DR</h3>\n<p>Panniers and racks are the staples for any touring bike, and with the growing popularity of racks and panniers on singletrack-oriented MTB tourers, we can only expect more and more micro panniers to hit the market. Revelate is a brand with roots in off-road touring setups, so it should be no surprise that the Nano Panniers would be some of the lightest and most durable panniers on the market.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1335\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-11.jpg?resize=1024,684&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-11.jpg?resize=768,513&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-11.jpg?resize=1800,1202&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-11.jpg?resize=1335,891&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-11.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-11.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>They withstood constant environmental abrasion and held a good amount of gear, freeing up handlebar bag and frame bag space and eliminating the need for a backpack, which is always a good thing.</p>\n<p>They are priced at $250 a pair and are made in the USA, which matters to me.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ultralight at 18oz for the pair</li>\n<li>Constructed from durable yet lightweight materials and hardware</li>\n<li>Plastic hardware is prolific in the outdoor gear space, so if you brake a buckle, you could replace it easily.</li>\n<li>Durable: 100 miles of rugged singletrack and nary a snare.</li>\n<li>Expandable from 7 to 11 liters.</li>\n<li>Extra “rigid” front strap keeps them shallow, at only 4″ wide in the short dimension</li>\n<li>They do work with a T-rack, but be mindful of your lower mounting procedure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Not waterproof, but running an UL 20L dry sack fixes that problem</li>\n<li>Expensive at $250 but MUSA</li>\n<li>Racks will wear on the bag’s back, but this can be eliminated with mastic tape on your rack.</li>\n<li>The color might not be for everyone; I wish they came in tan… ;-)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://www.revelatedesigns.com/index.cfm/store.catalog/cargo/NanoPanniers\" target=\"_blank\">Revelate Designs</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/revelate-nano-panniers-review/\">Deadfall, Cow Sh*t, and Monsoons: A Well Used Revelate Nano Panniers Review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"fc7055424015ca6d16f64033cc8a6054c0cc59df2f5ae770ac530175426ff3e8","category":"Cycling"}
