Now, there are signs that certain PS2 games will be similarly available for native download on the PS5, complete with new features like \"up-rendering, rewind, quick save, and custom video filters.\"</p>\n<p>The hint at Sony's coming PS2 download plans comes via a new PlayStation Network listing for the 2002 release <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em>, which recently appeared <a href=\"https://psdeals.net/us-store/game/2774293/star-wars-the-clone-wars\">on tracking site PSDeals</a> (as <a href=\"https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/ps2-emulated-star-wars-the-clone-wars-listed-on-playstation-store\">noticed by Gematsu</a>). That site draws from unpublished data from the PSN servers, such as <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/store/api/chihiro/00_09_000/container/US/en/99/UP1082-CUSA48010_00-0677672120279659/0/image?_version=00_09_000&amp;platform=chihiro&amp;bg_color=000000&amp;opacity=100&amp;w=336&amp;h=336\">this thumbnail image that recently appeared on the playstation.com servers</a>Â and lists a planned June 11 release for the emulated <em>Clone Wars</em> port.</p>\n<p>So far, this is nothing out of the ordinary. But near the bottom of the boilerplate, the listing notes that \"this title has been converted from the PlayStation 2 version to the PlayStation 4 <em>and PlayStation 5</em> consoles and <em>provides newly added features</em> [emphasis added].\" That's a marked difference from <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1004-CUSA03507_00-SLUS212690000001\">earlier \"PS2 on PS4\" downloadable releases</a>, which only say that they were \"converted from the original PlayStation 2 version to the PS4 system.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024887#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024887&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"97ba447aadcb5351157b758f6b75c7dfd5263802e461239f0687c07b157c9d0b","category":"Tech"}
