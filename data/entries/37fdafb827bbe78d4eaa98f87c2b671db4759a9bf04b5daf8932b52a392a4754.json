Instead, users in the EU who open Safari for the first time are presented with a choice screen that allows them to opt for a new default browser from a list of popular alternatives in their country.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe change has led to a sharp increase in third-party browser usage, based on several reports. On Wednesday, <em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/eus-new-tech-laws-are-working-small-browsers-gain-market-share-2024-04-10/\">Reuters</a></em> reported that users of privacy-first browser Aloha had jumped 250% in March. The jump in users largely came in France, Belgium (3x growth), Germany, The Netherlands, Spain and Sweden (2.5x growth), and Denmark, Italy and Poland (2x growth).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAloha browser markets itself as a privacy focused alternative to browsers that earns its money through paid subscriptions rather than selling ads by tracking users. The Cyprus-based company says it has 10 million monthly average users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Before, EU was our number four market, right now it's number two,\" Aloha CEO Andrew Frost Moroz said in an interview with <em>Reuters</em>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNorway's Vivaldi browser, Germany's Ecosia and U.S.-based Brave have all seen user numbers rise following the new regulation. U.S.-based DuckDuckGo, which has about 100 million users, and its more popular rival, Norway-based Opera, have also reported substantial increases.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo be eligible for consideration in the alternative browsers list, companies must have the Default Browser Entitlement that is available to developers. Apple also requires that the app has been downloaded by at least 5,000 ‌iPhone‌ users‌ across all 27 EU countries in the prior calendar year. Apple selects up to 11 of these for the browser choice screen in addition to Safari, updating the list once per calendar year. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle has also updated its Pixel software to show alternative browser choices, and says that new Android devices made by other companies will also display the choice screen in the coming months.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite users increasingly choosing alternative options, browser companies have criticized Apple and Google for the slow rollout of the change, and believe it is hampering the migration away from Safari and Chrome. Mozilla, which owns Firefox, estimates that only around a fifth of ‌iPhone‌ users in the EU have received the iOS update, and claims that the rollout is much slower than Apple's previous software updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome alternative browser makers are also concerned that the design of choice screens is sub-optimal at best. For example, Vivaldi CEO Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner notes that Apple's choice screen only appears when ‌iPhone‌ users open Safari, while the list of browsers provides no additional information. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"The process is just so convoluted that it's easiest for (users) to select Safari or potentially some other known name,\" he told <em>Reuters</em>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVivaldi is also unhappy with the design. \"The list of browsers does not show additional information and that does not help users to make a meaningful choice,\" a company spokesperson told <em><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/eu-dma-browser-choice-screen-early-impact/\">TechCrunch</a></em>. \"If the user has already selected a browser of their own choice, the choice screen can actively try to push them away from it, and may not even include it in the list that it presents to the user.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEcosia has also been critical, and says Apple's implementation involves an \"overly complex installation process\" and keeps Safari front and center on the user's ‌iPhone‌ Home screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe European Commission is currently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/eu-to-investigate-apple-dma-compliance/\">investigating</a> Apple's choice screen design for suspected noncompliance. The probe is being conducted in consultation with browser companies, who are likely to encourage regulators to push for a stronger implementation to level the competitive playing field. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/12/apple-eu-default-browser-options-criticized/\">Browser Companies Criticize Apple's EU Choice Screen in iOS 17.4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/browser-companies-criticize-apples-eu-choice-screen-in-ios-17-4.2424048/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"37fdafb827bbe78d4eaa98f87c2b671db4759a9bf04b5daf8932b52a392a4754","category":"Apple"}
