This is because <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/which-tubeless-sealant-works-the-best/\">tubeless sealant</a> dries up over time. The last thing you want to happen on a ride is to experience a puncture that doesn’t seal.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we’ll take you through how to top up your sealant and check your tyre for wear.</p>\n<h2>How often should you replace tubeless sealant?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tubeless tyre sealant spill\" title=\"Tubeless tyre sealant spill\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Replacing tubeless sealant is a messy job but one that can’t be avoided.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As a general rule, we’d recommend topping up your tubeless sealant every three to six months. We also recommend fully removing the tyre for inspection once every 12 to 18 months.</p>\n<p>Please note due to the vast array of tubeless sealants available, these timelines might differ for your specific setup.</p>\n<p>Climactic conditions, how often you ride and how you’ve stored your bike will all also impact the lifespan of your sealant.</p>\n<h2>You will need:</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pirelli P-Zero sealant in front of a Cinturato Velo tyre\" title=\"Pirelli P-Zero sealant in front of a Cinturato Velo tyre\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We’re using Pirelli P-Zero sealant in this example.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Fresh tubeless sealant</li>\n<li>Tubeless injector/syringe (optional)</li>\n<li>Cable tie and scissors (optional)</li>\n<li>Tyre levers</li>\n<li>Tubeless inflator or track pump</li>\n<li>Valve core removal tool</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to refresh your tubeless setup</h2>\n<h3>Step 1</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Removing valve core from a tubeless wheel\" title=\"Removing valve core from a tubeless wheel\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Once the tyre’s deflated, remove the valve core.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Deflate the tyre. Remove the valve core by slotting the removal tool over the core and turning anti-clockwise. You can also use pliers in a pinch.</p>\n<p>If the core won’t budge or the valve spins when you try to undo the core, grasp the stem of the valve with a pair of pliers to prevent it from turning.</p>\n<h3>Step 2</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Checking sealant levels with a cable tie\" title=\"Checking sealant levels with a cable tie\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The sealant levels in this tyre are fine.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>To avoid needlessly topping up sealant, we like to use a cable tie and poke it down the valve in the manner of a dipstick to check how much sealant is left in the tyre.</p>\n<p>Position the valve at six o’clock, so all of the sealant flows to the bottom. Dip the cable tie in. As a rough guide, we’d say if there’s more than a centimetre of sealant on the cable tie, you’re good to go.</p>\n<p>If you’re happy with the amount of sealant left, reinstall the valve core and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-pump-up-a-bike-tyre/\">pump up the tyre</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’ve decided you’re going to add sealant, you can either use an injector to install it through the valve core or remove one bead of the tyre to get a closer look at what’s inside. Removing one side of the tyre bead is an inevitably messier job.</p>\n<h3>Step 3</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Removing tyre with Pirelli P-Zero sealant\" title=\"Removing tyre with Pirelli P-Zero sealant\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We’re going to have a closer inspection in the tyre in this example.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>If you don’t have a syringe (or want to inspect the sealant more closely), remove one bead of the tyre with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tyre-levers/\">tyre lever</a>. Be mindful of where you are working because sealant is likely to spill onto the floor.</p>\n<p>In our example, there’s still some liquid pooling at the bottom, but if yours is completely dry or the sealant is congealed, it’s worth giving the tyre a thorough clean. The dried-up sealant only adds unnecessary weight.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Inspecting tyre sealant levels on a Pirelli Cinturato Velo tyre.\" title=\"09-29-28Bikeradar09_Sept_110923ss1000\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> While it’s not a sealant desert, it’s worth giving everything a clean.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>While you’re at it, inspect the tyre for any bigger cuts and check the rim tape for wear, replacing if necessary. We have a dedicated guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-repair-tubeless-puncture/\">how to repair a punctured tubeless tyre</a>.</p>\n<p>You may also want to consider fully removing the tubeless valve and giving it a thorough clean because sealant can gunk up inside. We like to use isopropyl alcohol for this.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth checking the body of the valve core moves freely because they can get clogged with sealant – if it doesn’t, it’s inexpensive to replace.</p>\n<h3>Step 4</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pirelli P-Zero sealant being installed in a tyre\" title=\"Pirelli P-Zero sealant being installed in a tyre\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Top up the sealant.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Refit the tyre and, before installing the last section of the bead, add the recommended amount of sealant.
