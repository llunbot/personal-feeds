Italian brand Sidi is based in foothills of the Italian Alps, in the city of Maser, and has been taking care of footwear since the 1960s, with a pivot into specifically two-wheeled shoes occurring a decade later. Fast forward to the 21st century and Sidi shoes have been worn by Grand Tour and classics winners in all of the world’s biggest races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With modern road riders becoming more and more exacting in their requirements, for a company to establish a strong reputation among both professional cyclists and performance-conscious amateurs requires significant investment in research and development. Whether it be stiffness via a carbon composite sole, modulated fit via dials and cabling, innovative moulding of foot lasts, or supportive, flexible and ventilated uppers made from technical microfibres or leathers, there are a huge range of details to be considered when producing top-tier cycling footwear.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"750\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-2-750x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-2-750x971.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-2-232x300.jpg 232w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-2-768x994.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-2-1187x1536.jpg 1187w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-2-1140x1475.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>While it makes sense for Sidi to be proud of its involvement in Grand Tour victories, its almost half century of heritage and its handmade philosophy, the Italian brand continues to try and push the envelope on new designs and technologies. Founder Dino Signori (that’s where the name Si-Di comes from) was responsible for the first adjustable plate system in a cycling shoe, which laid the foundations for the cleats we are used to riding in today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sidi is launching <a href=\"https://bit.ly/SidiCollection\" target=\"_blank\">a new collection of shoes for 2025</a> which embraces the highly regarded fit and performance of its existing shoes, but with a forward-thinking eye on incorporating new technologies too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 2025 Sidi collection covers the entire range of cycling disciplines, XC, MTB, Road and Gravel, not to mention every different weather system you might encounter. Every performance shoe includes a carbon composite sole since Sidi has a focus on efficiency regardless of the terrain. But there is also a two-bolt gravel shoe included which should be ideal for riders who are more concerned about comfort, versatility, and fit, than performance and stiffness. It’s a range that should have something for every rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sidi Ergo 6 road shoes | £299</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-3-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The latest in the Ergo road shoe line, designed for long rides and high-power training, the Sidi Ergo 6 leans into a sleeker, less cluttered aesthetic, with Velcro sidelined and two updated dials now solely responsible for fit duties. The asymmetric Sidi dials sit on the offside of the Ergo 6 shoes and pull together an engineered microfibre upper via what Sidi calls Firmor lateral straps and Dyneema cables – said to be light, durable, supple and 15 times stronger than steel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with other shoes in the 2025 range, the Ergo 6 uses the comfortable Millenium fit and a seamless heel counter to help with stability. The R2FC carbon sole is super stiff and incorporates a 75mm plate which allows for an additional 15mm of extension, so there should be comfortable cleat position attainable for every rider.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"776\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-4-776x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-4-776x970.jpg 776w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-4-240x300.jpg 240w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-4-768x960.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-4-750x938.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-4-1140x1425.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>For practicality – because everyone wants their shoes to look box fresh as long as possible – Sidi has subtly integrated bumpers into the toe area and included extensive ventilation on both the upper and the carbon plate. This all adds to a very competitive 278g weight per shoe. Plus, the perishable parts are easily replaceable, with spares available from Sidi, so the shoes should last for thousands of kilometres.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sidi Physis MTB shoes | £299</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"621\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-5-970x621.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-5-970x621.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-5-300x192.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-5-768x492.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-5-750x480.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-5-1140x730.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-5.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The smartly designed Physis shoes use an adjustable two-bolt cleat system, are designed for racing on rough surfaces and come in four dusky colourways. They use Sidi’s Millenium fit, which is designed with a combination of stability and comfort in mind. Sidi has rated the X2FC carbon composite sole 11 on its stiffness scale, which provides enough give to accommodate hike-a-bike sections and generally more clipped-out activity, but is also stiff enough to ensure efficient power transfer. There are a collection of rubber grippers on the sole to help riders maintain a secure footing. Sidi has included some nods to safety too, with hi-viz inserts slotted into the back of each heel.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-6-647x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-6-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-6-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-6-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-6-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-6.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As you might expect for a rough-stuff shoe, there is a focus on strength and durability. The double-layer upper incorporates beefy protective toe and heel panels, as well as integrated impact protectors, but doesn’t skimp on ample ventilation to ensure that riders’ feet benefit from consistent airflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fit is taken care of by Sidi’s patented Velcro Plustrap Closure and a proprietary Sidi dial. The combination provides a range of modulation for differently shaped feet. Sidi claims the strap prevents the gradual loss of tension over the course of a ride while the Unum Ergo tongue is said to be sculpted into a specifically anatomical shape. Alongside the Ergofeel sole – which maintains the natural shape of the foot – Sidi has taken care to provide lots of adjustment options for riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sidi Nix road shoes | £299</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-7-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-7-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-7-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-7-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-7-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-7-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-7-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-7.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>When the going gets tough, the tough keep on riding. Or at least they should be able to in the Sidi Nix which have been designed specifically for riding in the roughest conditions. A performance three-bolt road shoe, the Nix – created in partnership with foul weather specialists Gore-Tex – has an extended upper that wraps around the ankle to provide support and protection from the elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cirrus XT 4L and Gore-Tex ePE membrane upper is said to prevent the ingress of rainfall when riding and is also fleece lined, so should provide ample insulation too. As is now the norm for Gore-Tex, the membrane is PFAS free so you don’t have to worry about your footwear shedding any unnecessary forever chemicals into the land you ride on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a similar way to the design of the Ergo 6 shoes, the Nix uses Firmor Surround wraparound technology to keep the foot locked in place when riding. Fit is taken care of by a Velcro ankle strap alongside a proprietary Sidi dial that uses super strong Dyneema materials. The carbon composite sole has a Sidi rating of 9, and also uses nylon and fibre glass in its make up to aid with power transfer and durability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sidi Asper Lases shoes | £199</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-8-647x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-8-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-8-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-8-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-8-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-8-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-8-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-8.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sidi isn’t exclusively focussed on providing high performance footwear. The 2025 collection also tries to cater for riders who are less interested in smashing FKTs and tearing up trails, and more keen in taking their time to enjoy scenery and soak up everything the great outdoors has to offer. In keeping with a more everyday spec, the Asper Lases are also accessibly priced at £199.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What this means in practical terms, is fewer traditionally performance-based features, like a super stiff carbon composite sole or dual dial closures. Instead, the Sidi Asper Lases use – you guessed it – lace-up closures to ensure a relaxed and customisable fit. The Asper incorporates the new Millenium fit alongside a structured microfibre upper and an anatomically sculpted tongue to give riders the best chance of achieving a comfortable foot position.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-9-647x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-9-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-9-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-9-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-9-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-9-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/sidi-collection-9.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>With these two-bolt shoes intended for off-road adventures, durability and resilience are also a key consideration. The microfibre upper is said to be scratch-resistant and the body of the shoe includes impact protectors and 360-degree scuff panels. Sidi has designed the sole with comfort as a priority and a low stiffness rating of 5. The foot has space to move around on the sole when pedalling, which should help with any foot swelling on hot days, while the undersole’s chunky grippers are prepared for off-bike walking and hike-a-bike heavy parcours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• <a href=\"https://bit.ly/SidiCollection\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more about the Sidi 2025 Collection</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/sidi-2025-collection\">The Sidi 2025 Collection: Technology meets heritage</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"419822a3539229e241d61da3708c4079f0b446c9b7ba0878d91950840ecc42a2","category":"Cycling"}
