If beta testing goes well, the ability to archive posts is likely to be rolled out globally as an option rather than a default behavior, which Mosseri said was the overwhelming preference based on user feedback.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen it launched back in July, Threads was very barebones, with Meta working to add new functionality on a regular basis to bring the network in line with X (Twitter). It has since gained a web app, an ability to search for posts, and a post editing feature. Just last week, Threads began rolling out an option to some users to <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C5yvw9LP4j8\">filter search results</a> by the most recent posts, rather than just posts suggested by its algorithm. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe slow trickle of new features appears to be gradually paying off: The app now has more than 150 million monthly users, according to Mark Zuckerberg, who revealed the figures on Wednesday during Meta's <a href=\"https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2024/q1/META-Q1-2024-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf\">first-quarter earnings call</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/archive-posts-threads.jpg\" width=\"1441\" height=\"1440\" />\r<br />\nThe number indicates an increase of about 20 million new users since February, suggesting steady growth, albeit at a slower rate than its initial rapid popularity, when the app racked up 100 million users in its first week. Zuckerberg said in October he believes Threads has a good chance of becoming Meta's next billion-user app.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/threads/\">Threads</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/25/threads-tests-archive-option-150m-users/\">Threads Tests Option to Archive Posts as Platform Hits 150M+ Users</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/threads-tests-option-to-archive-posts-as-platform-hits-150m-users.2424881/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a8f95e5f65b447b57b708e193a3436631f3c276e65974261d2f0a26c053d0d41","category":"Apple"}
