Earlier this week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2024/INOA-PE24013-12241.pdf\">opened a safety probe into the electric vehicle</a>—its fourth so far. Open investigations are also examining whether the doors can fail to open, in addition to problems with shifting into or out of park and issues with partial braking loss over low-grip surfaces.</p>\n<p>The newest preliminary investigation was opened by NHTSA's ODI after the regulator received eight complaints of alleged inappropriate automatic emergency braking. AEB is one of the more effective new active driver safety systems. NHTSA added it to its list of recommended safety features <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/01/us-recommends-emergency-braking-tech-on-all-new-cars/\">almost a decade ago</a>, and last month, it<a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-04/final-rule-automatic-emergency-braking-systems-light-vehicles_web-version.pdf\"> published industry standards</a> that will make the feature mandatory on all new cars and trucks, although not until September 2029.</p>\n<p>But not every AEB implementation is equal. Both <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/teslas-radar-less-cars-investigated-by-nhtsa-after-complaints-spike/\">Tesla</a>'s and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/nhtsa-to-investigate-honda-accords-and-cr-vs-over-phantom-braking/\">Honda</a>'s systems have suffered from too many false positives, also known as phantom braking, triggering the feature inappropriately, sometimes resulting in that car being crashed into from behind.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023409#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023409&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
