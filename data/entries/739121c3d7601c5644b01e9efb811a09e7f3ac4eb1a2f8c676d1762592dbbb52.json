Ti bolts are always a nice lightweight upgrade for your bike. And they are often a chance to add a little colorful personalization to your bike. But titanium is expensive, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, these kits are available for as little as twenty bucks!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, even if you don’t have the latest super-expensive electronic SRAM drivetrains, you might still be able to add a little affordable bling to your bike. Terske also does similar ti bolt kits for SRAM Matchmaker brake clamps, Shimano MTB brake levers &amp; mechanical Shimano derailleurs, too…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Terske Titanium Bolt Kits, affordable ti
