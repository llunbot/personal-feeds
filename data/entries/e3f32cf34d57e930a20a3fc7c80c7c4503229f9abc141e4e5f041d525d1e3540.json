This year, Apple has made improvements that allow both models to offer the 5x Telephoto lens.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome pre-launch ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ rumors suggested that Apple might introduce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/iphone-16-pro-dual-48mp-cameras/\">a new camera sensor</a> that was exclusive to the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max, or a new super zoom feature, but that did not happen. Both models have the same 48-megapixel \"Fusion\" camera with f/1.78 aperture, as well as the same 12-megapixel Telephoto lens with f/2.8 aperture. Both models were also upgraded with a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera that lets in more light and supports better quality macro photos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the same camera technology included in both ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models, the only difference comes down to display size, starting storage capacity, and battery life. The ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ starts at 128GB of storage, while the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max starts at 256GB of storage with no 128GB option available. Both can be upgraded to 1TB of total storage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ has a 6.3-inch display, while the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max has a 6.9-inch display. As for battery life, the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ lasts for up to 27 hours when playing video, while the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max lasts for up to 33 hours.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth of the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models will be available for pre-order this Friday.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2024-apple-event/\">September 2024 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/iphone-16-pro-models-same-features/\">iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max Have Same Feature Set Aside From Display Size and Battery</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-and-iphone-16-pro-max-have-same-feature-set-aside-from-display-size-and-battery.2435591/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e3f32cf34d57e930a20a3fc7c80c7c4503229f9abc141e4e5f041d525d1e3540","category":"Apple"}
