Meet the Defy Advanced E+ Elite and the Liv Avail E+ Elite. There is no need for a cleaver naming conversation, as these models are based on the Defy and Avail models. It’s more than an e-road bike; it’s about giving a ride like a traditional road bike without the weight and cumbersome feel of a heavy mid-drive motor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-side-riders--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-side-riders--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Rider pedaling \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-side-riders--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-side-riders--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-side-riders--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-side-riders--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-side-riders--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-side-riders--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-side-riders--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-side-riders--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(All photos by:  https://www.instagram.com/tomjoyphoto)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Defy Advanced E+ Elite and Liv Avail E+ Elite</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What separates the Defy Advanced E+ Elite and the Liv Avail E+ Elite?</em> We can’t thoroughly discuss what makes this bike different without discussing the motor. The new SyncDrive Move Plus motor powers both ranges. Giant claims the new motor weighs 1.7kg (3.75 lbs) and is a rear hub-driven design. The motor and rear hub drive system uses Giant’s “e-road exclusive riding pattern.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-dropper--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-dropper--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Group of riders in the sunset \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-dropper--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-dropper--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-dropper--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-dropper--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-dropper--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-dropper--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-dropper--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-dropper--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>What does that mean? </em></strong>It’s a roundabout way of saying,<em> “It rides like a traditional road bike.” </em>You’ll notice the motor lurch and kick in less. If you’ve ridden an e-bike (road or MTB), you know that feeling when the motor kicks in/off. A slight drop when coasting or a lurch in power when you start from standing still. These are the sensations the SyncDrive Move Plus looks to eliminate.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-riding-1--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-riding-1--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Top of the bike with controls \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-riding-1--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-riding-1--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-riding-1--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-riding-1--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-riding-1--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-riding-1--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-riding-1--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-riding-1--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pedals Like a Real Bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how advanced these e-bikes get, they always aim to emulate the feel of a traditional road bike. Giant and Liv balance this with the new motor location, which rewards natural pedaling feedback. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-0-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-0-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Riders point of view \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-0-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-0-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-0-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-0-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-0-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-0-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-0-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-0-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>How fast will it go?</em></strong> Most e-bikes depend on where you live: 28mph MAX in the USA, 20mph MAX in Canada, and 16mph MAX in Europe. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-bike-side--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-bike-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Showing the tires clearance \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-bike-side--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-bike-side--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-bike-side--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-bike-side--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-bike-side--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-bike-side--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-bike-side--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-bike-side--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Are the Assist Modes?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Giant/Liv Defy Advanced E+ Elite and the Liv Avail E+ Elite have five different pedaling modes, plus an auto option. The modes gradually offer more support as the rider toggles through them. All modes are controlled via a control button integrated into the frame’s top tube or on the shifters, depending on the level. The Ridecontrol app allows rider customization and changes each mode’s top out and battery consumption. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-pick-up-0--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1707\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-pick-up-0--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Rider walking up the stairs \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-pick-up-0--scaled.webp 1707w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-pick-up-0--200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-pick-up-0--1536x2304.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-pick-up-0--80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-pick-up-0--768x1152.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-pick-up-0--1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-pick-up-0--1365x2048.webp 1365w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>How far can you ride on it?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SyncDrive gets its juice from a Panasonic Energypak 400 with a 400Wh battery run time. The battery integrates into the frame’s down tube and has a pretty unassuming look compared with others on the market. If you’re looking to ride far or explore, riders can also opt for the 200Wh range extender, which will get you “around 90 miles,” as Giant says. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-0--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-0--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Bike in the road with green background \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-0--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-0--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-0--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-0--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-0--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-0--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-0--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-0--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For safety, the EnergyPak 400 arrives covered with an aluminum casing, protecting it against daily use and hazards. It also benefits from temperature monitoring, with individually cased cells to prevent overheating. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-side--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1707\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"beauty shot of the Liv Avail + \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-side--scaled.webp 1707w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-side--200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-side--1536x2304.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-side--80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-side--768x1152.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-side--1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-1-side--1365x2048.webp 1365w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Frame Details </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Defy and Avail framesets use Giant’s Advanced composite carbon, the same carbon used to create the traditional version of the bike. Other Giant and Liv staples are the D-Fuse seatpost and handlebars, which reduce vibration and weight. The frames will both clear 38mm tires, so riders are clear to explore and ride slightly gravel-curious adventures. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-groupset--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-groupset--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Frame details for Liv Avail + 0 \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-groupset--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-groupset--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-groupset--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-groupset--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-groupset--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-groupset--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-groupset--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-groupset--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Build Options </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Defy Advanced E+ Elite and the Liv Avail E+ Elite exclusively use SRAM AXS groupsets.

The Elite 2 and Elite AR come with SRAM Force AXS, with the all-road version utilizing a single-ring setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-2--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-2--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Full bike in the road \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-2--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-2--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-2--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-2--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-2--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-2--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-2--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Liv-Avail-E-Elite-full-bike-2--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Defy Advanced E+ Elite and the Liv Avail E+ Elite Prices </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing for the Giant Defy Advanced E+ Elite and the Liv Avail E+ range starts at $6,500 / £5,999 for the AR models and tops out at $11,000 / £9,999 for the Elite AR bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.liv-cycling.com/us/bikes/electric-bikes/electric-road-bikes\">Livcycling.com </a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/giant-defy-advanced-e-elite-liv-avail-e-elite/\">Giant Defy Advanced E+ Elite &amp; Liv Avail E+ Elite Go All-In For Rear Drive</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"83f1133a75d99c4438f62040e1fe488e004708b0ed8cdf692aa8c806e6a54012","category":"Cycling"}
