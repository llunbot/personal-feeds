{"title":"Shazam Hits 100 Billion Song Recognitions","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/11/shazam-hits-100-billion-song-recognitions/","date":1732314118000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Shazam has now officially surpassed over 100 billion song\nrecognitions since it launched. To help put that into perspective:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>That’s equivalent to 12 songs identified for every person on\nEarth.</li>\n<li>A person would need to use Shazam to identify a song every\nsecond for 3,168 years to reach 100 billion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Shazam launched in 2002 as an SMS service in the UK, and back\nthen, music fans would dial 2580, hold up their phones to identify\nmusic, and receive the song name and artist via text message.\nShazam’s following and influence continued to grow in the years\nthat followed, but it was the 2008 debut of the App Store and\nintroduction of Shazam’s iOS app that brought its music\nrecognition technology to millions of users. By the summer of\n2011, Shazam had already recognized over 1 billion songs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had no idea Shazam started in the pre-iPhone era of mobile phones, getting audio via a phone call, and sending results via SMS. Clever! <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80132946\">That takes me back to Moviefone</a> — the service we’d dial in the 1990s to get theater listings and showtimes. You’d call your city’s local Moviefone number — almost certainly using your landline — navigate a menu (“Press 1 if you know the name of the movie you’d like to see...”), and Moviefone would tell you which theaters were showing it, at what times. It sounds archaic but it was great, and they did a great job with the phone menu user interface so you could navigate it quickly.</p>\n\n<p>It also reminds me of the very early days of IMDB, which preceded the web. You could send an email to IMDB with the name of a movie in the subject, and IMDB would email you back with all the information it had about that movie.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/22/shazam-hits-100-billion-song-recognitions\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"62d51658f63a59fc37a56ce82ca3df9553200e9156628f5bcc74141f28cef3f3","category":"Tech"}
