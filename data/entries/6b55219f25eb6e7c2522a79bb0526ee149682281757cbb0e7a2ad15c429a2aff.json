{"title":"Everything New in the iOS 18.5 Beta","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-5-beta-features/","date":1743638042000,"content":"Apple today provided developers with the first beta of an upcoming iOS 18.5 update for testing purposes. Work on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> is starting to wind down with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a> set to be introduced in a couple of months, so iOS 18.5 has just a handful of minor new features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iOS-18.5-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWe've rounded up what's new so far, but Apple could add additional features in upcoming betas.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Mail</h2>\r<br />\nIf you tap on the three dots icon in the upper right corner of the Mail app, you can now toggle Contact <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> on and off directly from this interface. There's also an option to turn off Group By Sender.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/mail-categories-ios-18-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nBoth of these options are in iOS 18.4, but the toggles are buried in the Mail section of the Settings app. They're easier to get to with iOS 18.5 for those who want the Mail app to look more like the pre-iOS 18 Mail app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can still access these toggles in the Settings app, too.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>AppleCare Info</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Settings app, if you go to General and tap on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a> and Warranty, there's now a banner with an ‌AppleCare‌ logo and an option to learn more about ‌AppleCare‌ coverage. There was no banner before.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/applecare-logo-ios-18-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nIf you go to your Apple Account and tap on a device in your device list, you'll now see a new ‌AppleCare‌ option that you can tap into to get info on your ‌AppleCare‌ coverage. There's also an option to Manage Plan from this interface if you have a renewing ‌AppleCare‌ plan.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/ios-18-5-applecare-apple-account.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<h2>More Features</h2>\r<br />\nKnow of something new in iOS 18.5 that we left out of this article? Let us know in the comments below. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Release Date</h2>\r<br />\nFor the last three years, the x.5 updates have come out in May, specifically the second week of May.
