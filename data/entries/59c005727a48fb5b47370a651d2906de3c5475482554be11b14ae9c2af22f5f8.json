Leckie, from Aberdeen, Scotland, was instantly hooked on the sci-fi series and its subsequent iterations and regularly attends conventions to meet up with fellow fans. But on November 16 he noticed something weird: Netflix had stopped promoting the first three seasons of <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em>—and previews of season four, due to launch on November 18, had also vanished.</p>\n<p>What Leckie had spotted would soon become a point of outrage for <em>Star Trek</em> fans the world over: Netflix had lost the rights to the fourth season of <em>Discovery </em>outside of the US, and the previous seasons, too. They would now appear on Paramount+, the streaming service formerly known as CBS All Access and owned by ViacomCBS—but not until 2022, and even then, not everywhere. (In the US, <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> has always streamed exclusively on Paramount+/CBS All Access.) And <em>Star Trek</em> is just the beginning. What’s bad news for <em>Discovery</em> fans now is yet another glimpse of the increasingly muddled future of streaming.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814473#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814473&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"59c005727a48fb5b47370a651d2906de3c5475482554be11b14ae9c2af22f5f8","category":"Tech"}
