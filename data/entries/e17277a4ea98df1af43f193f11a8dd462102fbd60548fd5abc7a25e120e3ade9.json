Although this is the newest version of the AirPods Pro, they're already seeing rock-bottom discounts and routinely beat the price on the 2019 non-MagSafe version.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/airpods-pro-holiday-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, Amazon has one of the all-around best Black Friday discounts, offering the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQMJHXY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">AirPods Pro with MagSafe</a> for <strong>$179.00</strong>, down from $249.00. Amazon is currently saying the AirPods Pro will be \"in stock soon\" and is accepting orders for mid-December delivery. The price has been as low as $159.00 this week, but supplies seem to be tightening, so you may not want to wait too much longer.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQMJHXY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$70 OFF</div>AirPods Pro w/ MagSafe for $179.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis version of the AirPods Pro comes with the MagSafe Charging Case, which is compatible with Apple's MagSafe Charger and other accessories that support MagSafe. Previously, the 2019 version included a Wireless Charging Case that supported Qi wireless charging but not MagSafe.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>AirPods 3 (2021)</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nIf you're looking to purchase the newest version of the AirPods, you'll want to head to Amazon for its discount on the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQL3NWT%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\">AirPods 3</a>. There, you can get the new model for <strong>$149.99</strong>, down from $179.00.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/airpods-3-holiday.jpg\" /><div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQL3NWT%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$30 OFF</div>AirPods 3 for $149.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n<div><em>Final price includes $20 taken off at checkout.</em></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough this is a very slight discount, it remains the steepest markdown that we've tracked on the AirPods 3. For anyone looking to save more money, we recommend looking at any other model, particularly the new AirPods Pro.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>AirPods Max (2020)</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nAmazon has <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZHYWJS%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue\">AirPods Max</a> for <strong>$429.00</strong>, down from $549.00. Only one color is available at this price, and the sale has been fluctuating in and out of availability all week, so if you see it at or around $429.00 be sure to make your purchase fast.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/airpods-max-holiday.jpg\" /><div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZD76NP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$120 OFF</div>AirPods Max for $429.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe're keeping track of all this season's best deals in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/black-friday/\"><strong>Black Friday 2021 Roundup</strong></a>.
