The Natural light scene can also be selected as part one of these time slots, to mimic the sun throughout the day.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSignify says both the brightness balancer feature for the Hue app and the Hue bridge automation enhancements are scheduled to launch later this summer.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/philips-hue/\">Philips Hue</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/20/philips-hue-brightness-balancer-feature/\">Philips Hue Lights to Get New Brightness Balancer Feature and Additional Automation Controls</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/philips-hue-lights-to-get-new-brightness-balancer-feature-and-additional-automation-controls.2393598/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9bb9f04e8df93ada91ca6cd211c75b289d70281a6ae36bb6eaeadd002c52f33b","category":"Apple"}
