Really nothing even comes close—the catch is that you’ll have to place your order soon because this deal ends on March 31.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This iMac has last year’s M3 chip, but it’s still a great machine with a gorgeous 24-inch Retina display with a 4480×2520 resolution that promises to deliver gorgeous colors and deep contrast. It’s built around a stunning minimal design—but you’ll have to settle for blue to get this price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M3 chip comes paired with 8GB of RAM, which is enough for Apple Intelligence but still pretty stingy, but it’s still great for streaming, everyday work, and so on. We <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2126614/24-inch-imac-m3-review.html\">reviewed the M3 iMac</a> and found it to be a great addition to any office, but we admittedly had the model with 24GB memory, considerably more than what the one on sale has. Thankfully, it has 512GB of storage, double the entry-level model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, it’s not just the iMac that you’re getting, but also the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID and a color-matched Magic Mouse, as well as a nifty power adapter with a built-in gigabit ethernet port. Unbox it and it’s literally plug in and start playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1793643-REG/apple_mqrr3ll_a_24_imac_with_m3.html\">This deal is set to expire just before midnight on March 31</a>, but if you want one it’s best to hurry up because if supply runs out it’ll be gone forever.</p>\n\n\n<span>Save $700 on the M3 iMac</span><div><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1793643-REG/apple_mqrr3ll_a_24_imac_with_m3.html\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at B&amp;H</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3f776d5f0fe8381ab0048c9b780fa15ba3bd907d12ea75da4ea300cf5f3b77d0","category":"Apple"}
