Known for their beloved bar tape that draws inspiration from colorful wildlife, their new <a href=\"https://www.campandgoslow.com/product/trout-tape-brown\" target=\"_blank\">Trout Tape</a> is “inspired by the tough and elusive Brown Trout”. It’s made using the same processes and durable custom-dyed nylon yarn as the brand’s Eastern and Western Rattler tape.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-closeup-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-closeup-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"New Camp and Go Slow Trout Tape closeup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-closeup-jpeg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-closeup-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-closeup-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-closeup-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-closeup-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-closeup-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / Sarah C&amp;GS)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Trout Tape is said to be softer and smoother than the Rattler tape. Inspired by the Brown Trout’s gorgeous colored scales, the colors should still look fantastic with your fave leather saddle. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-top-of-cockpit-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-top-of-cockpit-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"New Camp and Go Slow Trout Tape top of cockpit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-top-of-cockpit-jpeg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-top-of-cockpit-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-top-of-cockpit-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-top-of-cockpit-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-top-of-cockpit-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-top-of-cockpit-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / Sarah C&amp;GS)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Retail and What You Get</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $44</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-tape-and-bag-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-tape-and-bag-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"New Camp and Go Slow Trout Tape tape and bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-tape-and-bag-jpeg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-tape-and-bag-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-tape-and-bag-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-tape-and-bag-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-tape-and-bag-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-tape-and-bag-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / Sarah C&amp;GS)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Trout Tape comes in two 3300mm long rolls for the widest bars. The rolls will be packaged in a high-quality mesh drawstring bag. This bag is great for other uses, like storing loose goodies to throw in a bigger bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-side-shot-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-side-shot-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"New Camp and Go Slow Trout Tape side shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-side-shot-jpeg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-side-shot-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-side-shot-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-side-shot-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-side-shot-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/New-Camp-and-Go-Slow-Trout-Tape-side-shot-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / Sarah C&amp;GS)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trout Tape, like the Rattler tape, is backed with the same 1.5mm of foam (the perfect amount, BTW) for just the right amount o’ cushioning. The bar tape is made in Taiwan and the bag is cut and sewn in Seattle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What You Don’t Get…</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No bar end plugs are included, (I suggest <a href=\"https://www.campandgoslow.com/product/handlebar-plugs\" target=\"_blank\">going with these</a>, so add it to your cart). And no “finishing tape”, who uses it anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like the Rattler Tape, the Trout Tape can be cleaned and doesn’t stretch much, making it completely reusable. It’s a great product from a great lil’ brand. Click the link below and get yours before it sells out. You won’t regret it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.campandgoslow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CampAndGoSLow.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/camp-and-go-slow-new-trout-handle-bar-tape/\">Camp And Go Slow Release New Bar Tape Celebrating the Handsome Brown Trout</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"5b7898d00e2711fd6167f9f031f8b44f7821abf35f7293c2995280dae804e682","category":"Cycling"}
