Sounds as though you need a mudguard.</p>\n<p>The best front mudguards for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike/\">mountain bikes</a> attach to the lowers of your suspension fork, sitting close to the wheel, and catching mud and spray before it even gets close to you or your bike. The bigger the guard, the bigger the coverage, so it’s important to choose a mudguard that’s suitable for your trail conditions.</p>\n<p>Zip ties used to be the standard method of attachment for most front mudguards due to their strength and low cost.</p>\n<p>However, in the last few years, different mounting methods have surfaced: some mudguards bolt directly onto your fork crown, whereas others use velcro straps in place of zip ties as a reusable and less wasteful alternative.</p>\n<h3>Do I need a mountain bike mudguard?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SRAM Eagle Powertrain electric mountain bike motor fitted to a Nukeproof Megawatt enduro eMTB ridden by Alex Evans, BikeRadar's senior technical editor on a mountain bike trail at the Golfie in the Scottish Borders, UK.\" title=\"SRAM Eagle Powertrain electric mountain bike motor fitted to a Nukeproof Megawatt enduro eMTB-41\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mudguards help keep your vision clear when it matters most.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Mackison / SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>If you <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/5-quick-ways-to-get-mountain-bike-ready-for-a-season-of-mud/\">ride in the wet</a>, chances are you’ll benefit from using a mudguard. Front mudguards are light, relatively inexpensive and durable.</p>\n<p>As well as protecting your face and eyes from mud and spray, they also act as an extra layer of protection for your fork seals, protecting them from dirt and grime build-up.</p>\n<p>Many of the best mountain bike mudguards are also easily removable, especially those that bolt directly to your fork or are attached by reusable Velcro strips. So, if you really wanted to, you could even remove your mudguard for dry days and deploy it when rain is forecast.</p>\n<h3>How to fit mudguards to a mountain bike</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Saracen Zenith Elite LSL hardtail mountain bike\" title=\"Saracen Zenith Elite LSL hardtail mountain bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Small fenders like these make a difference, but they can’t compete with a full-coverage mudguard.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Max Wilman</i></span></div>\n<p>Most mudguards are designed to attach to your mountain bike via pre-drilled holes in the plastic moulding, which can then be attached to your fork brace and lowers (or frame, in the case of rear mudguards) with zip ties.</p>\n<p>However, in an attempt to reduce single-use waste, some manufacturers now offer hook and loop straps, which do the same job as the plastic zip ties but are reusable, should you want to remove your mudguard or swap it between bikes.</p>\n<p>Some fork manufacturers have also introduced bolt holes on the back of their fork braces. This allows for compatible mudguards to be bolted directly to the fork and results in a very clean look.</p>\n<h3>How much coverage do I need?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mudhugger Rear mountain bike mudguard\" title=\"Mudhugger Rear mountain bike mudguard-2\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rear mudguards aren’t a common sight on the trails for a couple of reasons.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>How much coverage you need depends on the trails and weather where you ride. If you ride predominantly in dry climates or on super-hardpacked trail surfaces, mud won’t be too much of a concern and you may get away with a shorter mudguard to keep the occasional puddle at bay.</p>\n<p>However, if you live somewhere prone to rain and ride natural trails, a mudguard with bigger coverage will do a much better job of keeping the slop off your face.</p>\n<h3>Front vs rear mountain bike mudguards</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"29in, 27.5in and 26in mountain bike wheel sizes\" title=\"29in, 27.5in and 26in mountain bike wheel sizes\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Most mudguards are compatible with a range of wheel sizes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>While front mudguards are a common sight on the trails and quickly becoming the norm in wetter climates, rear mudguards aren’t often seen on mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>This is because, as well as not being particularly flattering (although this is subjective), they tend to be noisy at best and at worst they can hinder a rider’s range of motion on the bike.</p>\n<p>While there are some options out there that keep most of the mud off your back – such as the Mudhugger MK2 rear mudguard – the priority for most riders is to keep their vision clear. A good front mudguard does just that without any side effects.</p>\n<p>If it’s very wet and you’re worried about spray from your rear wheel, we’d recommend a good pair of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-waterproof-mtb-shorts/\">waterproof shorts</a>.</p>\n<h3>Do I need a specific mudguard for my wheel size?</h3>\n<p>The mudguards on test here are compatible with both <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/mountain-bike-wheel-sizes-26in-650b-and-29in-explained/\">29in and 27.5in</a> wheels.
