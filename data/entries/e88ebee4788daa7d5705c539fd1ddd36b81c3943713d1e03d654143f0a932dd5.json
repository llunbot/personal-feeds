Well, probably not given there is literally only one mountain in the world that long, and it's not exactly rideable. That is until now.</p>\n<p>New <a href=\"/reviews/667/the-best-turbo-trainers-a-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">indoor training</a> and event platform Race Republic has launched the Everest Challenge, where partipiants will virtually ride a virtual 'photo-realistic' Mount Everest with a choice between a 50-mile 12% or 100-mile 6% course to reach the 8,849m (29,032 feet) total.</p>\n<p>The views will include Everest basecamp, the Khumbu Icefall and the Hillary Step as well as sherpas, yaks and yetis and there will literally be no rest, with climbing the whole way.</p>\n<p>\nFor that reason, the world record will certainly be broken so the race is on. From the start on 31st December the first man and women to break the record will be rewarded with $5,000, though if multiple people break the 6:40:54 or 8:33:47 times on the day, the fastest times before 31st January 2022 get the money.</p>\n<p>If you're not a complete masochist you can actually pause your effort and pick it up again other day to just enjoy(?) the experience.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/10251/best-cycling-deals\">Best cycling deals 2021: Cyber Monday bike and kit discounts</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/10269/cycling-hour-record\">What is the cycling Hour Record?</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/4343/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: the best bikes on the market from under £1,000 to over £10,000</a></div>    </div></div><h2>If it's good enough for Alberto Contador...</h2>\n<p>Former pros Floyd Landis and David Zabriskie will be taking part – with Landis's CBD company Floyd's of Leadville sponsoring the event and offering a prize to the rider who can climb the furthest in an hour.
