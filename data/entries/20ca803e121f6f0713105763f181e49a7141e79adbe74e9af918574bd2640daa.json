{"title":"AMD launches new Ryzen 9000X3D CPUs for PCs that play games and work hard","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/amd-launches-new-ryzen-9000x3d-cpus-for-pcs-that-play-games-and-work-hard/","date":1736192735000,"content":"<p>AMD's batch of CES announcements this year includes just two new products for desktop PC users: the new Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D. Both will be available at some point in the first quarter of 2025.</p>\n<p>Both processors include additional CPU cores compared to the 9800X3D that launched in November. The 9900X3D includes 12 Zen 5 CPU cores with a maximum clock speed of 5.5 GHz, and the 9950X3D includes 16 cores with a maximum clock speed of 5.7 GHz. Both include 64MB of extra L3 cache compared to the regular 9900X and 9950X, for a total cache of 144MB and 140MB, respectively; games in particular tend to benefit disproportionately from this extra cache memory.</p>\n<p>But the 9950X3D and 9900X3D aren't being targeted at people who build PCs primarily to gameâ€”the company says their game performance is usually within 1 percent of the 9800X3D. These processors are for people who want peak game performance when they're playing something but also need lots of CPU cores for chewing on CPU-heavy workloads during the workday.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/amd-launches-new-ryzen-9000x3d-cpus-for-pcs-that-play-games-and-work-hard/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/amd-launches-new-ryzen-9000x3d-cpus-for-pcs-that-play-games-and-work-hard/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"20ca803e121f6f0713105763f181e49a7141e79adbe74e9af918574bd2640daa","category":"Tech"}
