But what if you already have a dropper post, or don’t like the look of bulky batteries hung off the post? OnlyMotion has the answer. Or, they will… once their Kickstarter campaign is finished. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calling it the “world’s first electronic dropper post conversion,” OnlyMotion pairs a wireless remote with an electronic actuator that mounts to the bottom of your existing seat post. More than upgrading existing posts, OnlyMotion claims it’s a lighter system than most wireless droppers as well, with a claim of 125g less than the SRAM Reverb AXS (including battery, without remote). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OnlyMotion-wireless-dropper-post-conversion-kit2.jpg.avif\"><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OnlyMotion-wireless-dropper-post-conversion-kit2.jpg.avif\" alt=\"OnlyMotion wireless dropper post conversion kit\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OnlyMotion-wireless-dropper-post-conversion-kit3.jpg.avif\"><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OnlyMotion-wireless-dropper-post-conversion-kit3.jpg.avif\" alt=\"OnlyMotion wireless dropper post conversion kit\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The small battery hidden inside your seat tube is good for 150 hours of ride time, or about 4,000 activations and charges with a USB-C cord in about 10 minutes. Instead of having to remove the dropper post from the frame to charge it, there is an actuator charge cable that is plugged into the remote, and then you plug in the USB-C cable to the remote to charge. Once charged, the actuator cable stores in the frame, with the end poking out of the dropper post cable opening. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a diameter of 30.7mm, the actuator is is designed to fit bikes with 30.9mm seat posts and up. They recommend following the OneUp seat post sizing  and subtracting a custom measurement. Or, you can 3D print a test dummy, attach it to your post and double check before ever ordering anything. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently it seems that the OnlyMotion actuator will fit the OneUp V2 and V3, Fox Transfer, Bontrager Fall Line, and Race Face Turbine R dropper posts. Pricing is currently offered at about $174 through the Kickstarter, which is far cheaper than the $399 msrp. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>OnlyMotion Specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Weight: Actuator 100g – remote 40g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Batteries type: Internal (both remote and actuator)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Batteries life: 150h or about 4000 cycles (remote and actuator are charged together)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dropper post diameter compatibility: 30.9mm and up</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Actuator length: 47mm (from the bottom end of your dropper post)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Operating temperature: -20°C to +40°C</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weather Resistance: IP65-rated (dustproof &amp; water-resistant for all-weather riding)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dropper post brand compatibility:\n<ul>\n<li>OneUp V2 &amp; V3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fox transfer</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bontrager Fall Line</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Race Face Turbine R Dropper Seatpost</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/onlymotion/worlds-first-electronic-conversion-for-dropper-post\"><em>kickstarter.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/onlymotion-electronic-dropper-post-conversion-kit/\">OnlyMotion Electronic Dropper Post Conversion Kit Makes Your Wired Post Wireless</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"59db2a28503afe23abc3fab947b3b773bae104b84b906d4f91aae881314c6803","category":"Cycling"}
