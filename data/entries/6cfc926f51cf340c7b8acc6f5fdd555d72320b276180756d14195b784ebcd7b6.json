Dogs, for instance—definitely not crabs. Science also suggests that humans are not, in fact, crabs. But a surprising number of creatures either are crabs or look a lot like them. For example, a hermit crab has a distinctly crab-like appearance but is not technically a real crab. Hermit crabs are not alone; over the history of life on Earth, there have been five separate cases in which decapod crustaceans have evolved this way, a process common enough that it has picked up a formal term: carcinization.</p>\n<p>Around <a href=\"https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/people-are-just-now-discovering-carcinization-and-they-are-not-huge-fans/\">a year ago</a>, this evolutionary process captured the imagination of the Internet. Headlines like “<a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/animals/why-everything-becomes-crab-meme-carcinization/\">Why everything eventually becomes a crab</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/why-does-evolution-keep-turning-everything-into-crabs/\">Why Does Evolution Keep Turning Everything Into Crabs</a>” popped up. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvfR3XLXPvw\">PBS</a> even made a video.</p>\n<p>\"Everything\" is clear hyperbole—the overwhelming majority of things on Earth are not crabs and seemingly have no plans to become them. But if there are benefits to having a crab-like shape on Earth, should we view that as a general rule of life? Could it hold true on other planets? If the process of carcinization operates here, it's not unreasonable to expect that it might happen elsewhere.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783832#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783832&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Doug Johnson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6cfc926f51cf340c7b8acc6f5fdd555d72320b276180756d14195b784ebcd7b6","category":"Tech"}
