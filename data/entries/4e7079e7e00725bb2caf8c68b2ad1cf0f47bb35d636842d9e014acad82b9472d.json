The Android ecosystem was supposed to have its own version of Apple's AirTags by now. Google has had a crowd-sourced device-tracking network sitting dormant on 3 billion Android phones since <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/google-plans-airtag-clone-will-track-devices-with-3-billion-android-phones/\">December 2022</a>. Partners have been ready to go with Bluetooth tag hardware since <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/bluetooth-tags-for-androids-3-billion-strong-tracking-network-are-here/\">May 2023</a>! This was all supposed to launch a year ago, but Google has been in a holding pattern. The good news is we're finally seeing some progress after a year of silence.</p>\n<p>The reason for Google's lengthy delay is actually Apple. A week before Google's partners announced their Android network Bluetooth tags, Google and Apple <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/apple-and-google-submit-joint-proposal-to-fight-malicious-use-of-tracking-devices/\">jointly announced</a> a standard to detect \"unknown\" Bluetooth trackers and show users alerts if their phone thinks they're being stalked. Since you can constantly see an AirTag's location, they can be used for stalking by just covertly slipping one into a bag or car; nobody wants that, so everyone's favorite mobile duopoly is teaming up.</p>\n<p>Google did its half of this partnership and rolled out AirTag detection in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/android-phones-can-now-tell-you-if-theres-an-airtag-following-you/\">July 2023</a>. At the same time, Google also announced: \"We’ve made the decision to hold the rollout of the Find My Device network until Apple has implemented protections for iOS.\" Surely Apple would be burning the midnight oil to launch iOS Android tag detection as soon as possible so that Google could start competing with AirTags.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015125#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015125&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4e7079e7e00725bb2caf8c68b2ad1cf0f47bb35d636842d9e014acad82b9472d","category":"Tech"}
