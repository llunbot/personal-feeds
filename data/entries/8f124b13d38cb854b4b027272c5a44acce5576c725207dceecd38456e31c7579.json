So, we jumped at the opportunity to spend a day with the 22-year-old at his home in Andorra for a centrepiece interview in our latest issue.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>The Yorkshireman was engaging company, modelling Ineos Grenadiers' striking 2022 kit and answering readers' questions. You posed a quirky and varied mix: everything from Metallica mentions to whether he'll pop a Superman celebration next year. Here's a sneak peek at some of his most interesting answers.</span></p>\n<p><b>1. He’s planning on running a timed 5,000 metres at Nike’s facility in Oregon in February 2022<br /></b></p>\n<p><span>While debunking the myth of his 13-minute 5k that had athletics Twitter in meltdown in early 2021, <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tom-pidcock-didn-t-run-a-13-25-5km-but-is-headed-to-oregon-to-see-how-fast-he-can-go\">he revealed that Nike want him to put on trainers and race the clock after the cyclo-cross world championships</a>, which takes place in Arkansas (January 29-30). “</span>I don’t want to get over 15 minutes. It’s pointless, innit?” he said, tongue in cheek.</p>\n<p><b>2. He knows he can’t mix cycling disciplines forever<br /></b></p>\n<p>The 22-year-old is confident he can win a Grand Tour in the next five years but is aware he’ll have to briefly give up the mud and singletrack: “If I ever did want to fully focus on Grand Tours, then I wouldn’t be able to do other disciplines in that year – it doesn’t mean I wouldn’t go back to them. But, at least until Paris 2024 [I’ll be mixing them].\"</p>\n\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/INEOS-Slideshow_Mob_1024x1024.jpg?v=1638878737\" /></div>\n<p><b></b><br /><em><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/subscribe\">Subscribe to Rouleur</a> and receive our special limited edition Tom Pidcock cover</em></p>\n<p><b>3. He had a special present for the surgeon who fixed his collarbone<br /></b><span></span></p>\n<p><span>Pidcock broke his collarbone in early June 2021, less than two months before the Olympic Games. However, his surgeon’s sterling work meant disaster was averted; he was back on the bike within six days. After taking gold in Tokyo, Pidcock arranged for a signed, framed jersey to go to his medical quick fixer.</span></p>\n<p><b>4. He’s never had a hangover<br /></b><span></span></p>\n<p><span>This is a claim Peter Sagan once made to Rouleur too. Not a big drinker, Pidcock says he’s only had alcohol four times in his life.</span></p>\n<p><b>5. He didn’t know who Sven Nijs was<br /></b><span></span></p>\n<p><span>Strange, and sacrilegious, for this king of the cyclo-cross scene, but true: “The first year I started going away to Belgium and did a few races, I didn’t actually know who anyone was in ‘cross. I didn’t really follow the sport at all. Then at the Worlds [that year], I only just learned who Sven Nijs was.” </span></p>\n<br /> \n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Tom-Rouleur-Edits-14_1024x1024.jpg?v=1638528394\" /></div>\n<p><b>6. Red Bull Rampage and downhill races: why not?<br /></b><span></span></p>\n<p><span>Asked whether he’s planning to ride Red Bull Rampage, he replied: “Well, I want to ride a downhill World Cup first. Rampage, I need to go and see because obviously everything looks smaller on TV than it does in real life. So, I don’t know: it’s on my bucket list to ride it but I dunno if I ever will – the older you get, the less stupid stuff you generally do.” Ineos Grenadiers might have something to say about it if he crocks himself freeriding in Utah too.</span></p>\n<p><b>7. He can ride a unicycle<br /></b></p>\n<p>Road, mountain bike, cyclo-cross, running – and even riding on one wheel. Pidcock is a true Renaissance man. “I used to ride them with my friends at school, going out riding in the woods and stuff,\" he says. Not recently, but it’s like riding a bike: you don’t forget once you know how to do it. I probably won’t be able to do 360s anymore though.”</p>\n<i>The new issue of Rouleur, dedicated to Interviews, goes on sale on December 16, featuring Pidcock, Anna van der Breggen, Mads Pedersen, Lizzie Deignan and many others.
