You may or may not care about new <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/windows-utilities-like-paint-and-snipping-tool-could-get-an-ai-infusion-soon/\">AI-themed MS Paint additions</a> or the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/microsoft-will-try-the-data-scraping-windows-recall-feature-again-in-october/\">soon-to-be-reborn Recall feature</a>, but you've almost certainly interacted with one of Windows' Control Panel applets at some point in the last 39 years. And according to a note <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-configuration-tools-in-windows-f8a49657-b038-43b8-82d3-28bea0c5666b\">buried on Microsoft's support site</a>, those Control Panels' days may be numbered (emphasis ours):</p>\n<p>\"The Control Panel is a feature that's been part of Windows for a long time. It provides a centralized location to view and manipulate system settings and controls,\" the support page explains. \"Through a series of applets, you can adjust various options ranging from system time and date to hardware settings, network configurations, and more. <strong>The Control Panel is in the process of being deprecated in favor of the Settings app, which offers a more modern and streamlined experience.</strong>\"</p>\n\n<p>This won't be news to anyone who has followed Windows' development over the last decade. The Settings app was initially introduced in Windows 8 in 2012 as a touchscreen-friendly alternative for some of the Control Panel applets, but during the Windows 10 era it began picking up more and more Control Panel settings, and by the time Windows 11 rolled around it was full-featured enough to serve as a complete Control Panel replacement most of the time, with a handful of exceptions made for especially obscure changes (and those who simply prefer the Old Ways).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045029#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045029&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"13a63dae3ec11fc33a7be201768443829916b1de8373f34aced2367631740a09","category":"Tech"}
