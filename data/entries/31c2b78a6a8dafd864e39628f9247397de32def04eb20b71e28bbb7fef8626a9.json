As <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/3d-printed-mac-replica-is-a-maker-masterwork-inside-an-entirely-accurate-shell/\">Ars Technica</a></em> points out, Noki went completed more than 29 complex steps, each of which was a major task on its own. He started out by measuring every single surface and angle of a Macintosh Plus, modeling it in AutoDesk Fusion 360, and then printing the parts, putting them together, filling gaps, sanding, and texturing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe modified a 10-inch thrift store screen to have LED backlighting and a dimmer knob, he crafted a power assembly, built in connectors, speakers, and other hardware, and designed a Mini vMac emulator using Linux. The whole process is fascinating to watch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Mac Plus is the exact right size and texture, it supports 3.5-inch disks, it supports appropriate Apple keyboards and mice, and has every other detail you would expect from a real Mac. Printing the components took over 48 hours, and the whole project spanned 40 weeks.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/functional-3d-printed-macintosh/\">Check Out This Functional 3D Printed Macintosh</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/check-out-this-functional-3d-printed-macintosh.2422404/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"31c2b78a6a8dafd864e39628f9247397de32def04eb20b71e28bbb7fef8626a9","category":"Apple"}
