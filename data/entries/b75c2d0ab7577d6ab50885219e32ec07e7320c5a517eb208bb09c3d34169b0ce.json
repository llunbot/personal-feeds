He oversaw Apple's cloud infrastructure for services like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a>, iMessage, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> before <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/apple-vp-of-cloud-engineering-leaving/\">leaving the company</a> in March.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAbbott's role at GM will encompass several key functions, including information and digital technology, software-defined vehicle and operating systems, and the company's digital business.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe will report directly to GM CEO Mary Barra. In a statement, Barra said \"Mike's experience as a founder and entrepreneur coupled with his proven track record creating and delivering some of the market's most compelling software-defined solutions for consumers and companies make him an excellent fit at GM.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn March, GM <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/general-motors-to-phase-out-apple-carplay/\">announced plans</a> to phase out Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> and Android Auto in its vehicles starting this year, shifting to a built-in infotainment system co-developed with Google. The move is expected to help the automaker gather more data about how consumers drive, incentivize vehicle-related digital subscription services, and create recurring revenue opportunities. Abbott is said to play a key role in implementing this strategy.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/general-motors/\">General Motors</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/09/gm-hires-apple-executive-to-lead-software/\">General Motors Hires Former Apple Executive to Lead Software After Announcing Plans to Nix CarPlay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/general-motors-hires-former-apple-executive-to-lead-software-after-announcing-plans-to-nix-carplay.2389095/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b75c2d0ab7577d6ab50885219e32ec07e7320c5a517eb208bb09c3d34169b0ce","category":"Apple"}
