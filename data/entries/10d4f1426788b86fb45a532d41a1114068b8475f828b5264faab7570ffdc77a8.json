I’ve seen them on social media and in various home automation forums, and I’ve even noticed them in the comments on this website. For this type of person, the Homey Pro might serve as a specialized, locally focused smart home hub, one that's well worth the cost. But you should be really, truly certain that you’re that person before you take a $400 leap with it.</p>\n<p>Homey Pro is a smart home hub pitched primarily at someone who wants to keep things local as much as possible, forgoing phone apps, speakers, and cloud connections. That means using the Homey Pro to boost a primarily Zigbee or Z-Wave network, while also looping in local Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and even infrared remotes. It’s for someone willing to pay $400 for a device that offers robust local or cloud backups, professional design, advanced automation, and even a custom scripting language, along with access to some “experiments” and still-in-progress tech like Matter and Thread. It’s for someone who might want to add a select cloud service or two to their home, but not because they have no other option.</p>\n<p>But this somebody has also, somehow, not already invested in <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/\">Home Assistant</a>, <a href=\"https://hubitat.com/\">Hubitat</a>, or <a href=\"https://homebridge.io/\">HomeBridge</a>, which are more open to both add-on hardware (like new capabilities added on <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/skyconnect/\">by USB stick</a> or GPIO pins) and deep tinkering. It's someone who is willing to check that every device they want to control will work with Homey. While the device offers <a href=\"https://homey.app/en-us/apps/homey-pro/\">a pretty sizable range of apps and integrations</a>, it’s far from the near-universal nature of major open-source projects or even the big smart home platforms. And you have to do a little checking further, still, to ensure that individual products are supported, not just the brand.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988289#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988289&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"10d4f1426788b86fb45a532d41a1114068b8475f828b5264faab7570ffdc77a8","category":"Tech"}
