Wednesday’s Olympic time trials were anything but boring, with star-studded startlists in both the women’s and men’s events, and gold medals for two riders left disappointed in recent days and weeks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so much action crammed into just 65.6 km of racing across both events, we felt there was no better way to display the grit, determination, disappointment, and celebration than with a huge gallery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, put the kettle on and enjoy a selection of photos from the action at the Tokyo Olympics, courtesy of the Cor Vos photo agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Ashleigh-Moolman-Tokyo-2020-Olympic-Time-trial-17-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Ashleigh Moolman finished in eighth place, 2:24 down on eventual winner Annemiek van Vleuten.<br /></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Chloe-Dygert-USA-Tokyo-2020-Olympic-Time-trial-20-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Chloe Dygert was one place higher in seventh, not yet back to her very best following that crash at the Imola World Championships less than a year ago.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Christine-Majerus-Luxembourg-Tokyo-2020-Olympic-Time-trial-8-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Christine Majerus was one of five SD Worx riders on national team duty in the Olympic time trial.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Elisa-Longo-Borghini-Tokyo-2020-Olympic-Time-trial-16-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Elisa Longo Borghini couldn’t replicate her fifth place ride from the Rio Olympic time trial, finishing 10th on the Fuji Speedway course.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eri-Yonamine-Tokyo-2020-Olympic-Time-trial-11-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Eri Yonamine was the sole representative for the host nation Japan in Wednesday’s time trials. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Karol-Ann-Canuel-Canada-Tokyo-2020-Olympic-Time-trial-9-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Karol-Ann Canuel, another of the SD Worx riders, finished the day in 14th position.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tokyo-2020-Olympic-Time-trial-10-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Sarah Gigante missed a top ten in her first Olympic TT by just one second or .02 km/h.
