Recently, they’ve been on a mission to improve the functionality of the app &amp; website with new features such as <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ride-with-gps-quicknav-navigation-app-directions-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">QuickNav</a>. Those improvements have made a Ride with GPS subscription more useful than ever – and now those subscriptions are on sale. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re told that this is the only discount they run during the year, which means if you plan on paying for a Premium RwGPS account, now is the time. Available until December 31st, RwGPS is offering 15 months of premium for the price of 12. That means you’re paying $79.99 for 15 months, which works out to a 25% discount. As a bonus, if you’re an existing basic subscriber, your remaining Basic balance will be automatically upgraded to Premium before the new subscription kicks in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could <a href=\"https://ridewithgps.com/gifts\">purchase the plan for yourself, or give it as a gift</a>. The subscription can be redeemed any time in the future, and if you choose to gift the subscription, you can choose the delivery date when it will be delivered via email. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to start planning those rides in the new year! </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ride-with-gps-premium-subscription-sale-promo/\">Ride with GPS Through 2025 with Three Free Months of Premium</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"2c31a199b58ffa8e57c179c3c54bd5715b3abbd37bfe94c9c01e2c9787fa41a0","category":"Cycling"}
