Google said it will \"modify or cease the disputed advertising claim.\"</p>\n<p>The case was handled in the advertising industry's self-regulatory system, not in a court of law. The National Advertising Review Board (NARB) <a href=\"https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/narb-google-youtube-tv\">announced today</a> that it rejected Google's appeal and recommended that the company discontinue the YouTube TV claim.</p>\n<p>YouTube TV launched in 2017 for $35 a month, but the base package is $72.99 after the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/youtube-tv-jumps-in-price-again-its-now-72-99-per-month/\">latest price hike</a> in March 2023. Google's \"$600 less than cable\" claim was challenged by Charter, which uses the brand name Spectrum and is the second-biggest cable company after Comcast. The National Advertising Division (NAD) previously ruled in Charter's favor but Google <a href=\"https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/google-youtube-tv\">appealed the decision</a> to the NARB in August.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975403#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975403&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a46871af2dce235840edfa579f99aafa7c96ba8058ac69c362e2d8e621b70cbf","category":"Tech"}
