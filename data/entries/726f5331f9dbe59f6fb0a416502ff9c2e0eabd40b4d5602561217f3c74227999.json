I wrote eleven of them. <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/travis-engel/\" target=\"_blank\">It’s kinda my thing</a>. My background is in mainstream mountain bike media where carbon fullies are <i>everyone’s</i> thing. Even though The Radavist gives me the freedom to write about stuff like my <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/making-your-own-bicycle-frame-bags/\" target=\"_blank\">DIY frame bags</a> and my <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bike-hacks-prism-reading-glasses-for-bikepacking/\" target=\"_blank\">prism reading glasses</a> and my … <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ad-ointment-review-bikepacking-comfort/\">ointments</a>, I still love an opportunity to talk about new expensive machines, and why they’re better than the expensive machines that came out four years ago.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-30.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-30.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-31.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-31.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-31.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-31.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>That’s exactly what I did in my first-ride review of the new Trailcat SL and Trailcat LT. They are indeed better than what came out four years ago, and they are indeed expensive. But as I wrote in my review, a Pivot bike isn’t actually more expensive than most of its comparably specced, non-consumer-direct competitors. I think what gives Pivots their pricey reputation (besides clickbait articles like this) is that they have a high ceiling and a high floor.</p>\n<p>The reasons behind the high ceiling are simple enough. Some Pivot models stretch past $13,000. That’s often because they’re loaded up with tip-top-shelf specs that other bike brands might not bother with. Like full XTR or XX or electronically controlled suspension. On the other end is Pivot’s high floor. Many models don’t go below $6,000. The reasons behind <i>that</i> are a bit more interesting.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-11.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-11.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Tolerances</h3>\n<p>I’m not here to say whether Pivot uses tighter tolerances or more careful measurements than any other brand. I’ve never gotten the introduction to anyone else’s quality-control department like I got at the Pivot headquarters. And there may be a good reason. The most interesting bay along Pivot’s QC workflow was an eyes-only zone, so I can’t share the details. It was essentially a way to check that all the frame’s contact points were in alignment. As Pivot’s founder, Chris Cocalis was glossing over the specifics, he said casually in passing that every frame gets that same check.</p>\n<p>I stopped him when he said, “Every frame.” That can mean a lot of things. In Pivot’s case, it indeed means literally every single frame that passes through their hands. But it’s not just that. A process similar to the one I can’t talk about is done individually for the rear triangle, the front triangle, and finally, after they’re assembled.</p>\n<p>Along the way, every bearing interface is checked. There’s an interesting, invisible asymmetry to how the bearings fit in Pivot’s lower DW link. One side is “press-fit,” meaning it’s pressed in as tight as you’d expect any pivot bearing to be. But the other side is a “slip fit.” This allows for a bit of movement as the frame inevitably flexes laterally, leading to longer bearing life.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-28.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-28.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-07.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-07.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-07.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-07.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Apparently, press-fit and slip-fit are specific terms in machining. I’m no expert, but <a href=\"https://www.engineersedge.com/dowel_pin.htm\">some quick Googling</a> told me the difference between the two is about 0.0015 inches, and every link that makes it onto a retail Pivot bike gets that checked. That level of quality control is one reason why Pivot is so confident in its press-fit bottom brackets.</p>\n<p>But I won’t relitigate that here. It’s already going on in my Trailcat review’s <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/pivot-trailcat-sl-lt-review/#meta\">comment section.</a> Basically, there’s a bunch of custom gadgets deployed at multiple points along the manufacturing process, adding multiple time-consuming steps, which is kinda expensive.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-09.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-09.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Prototyping</h3>\n<p>Here’s another topic where I can’t say definitively that Pivot has the edge because, by its nature, prototyping is a secretive process. But it’s become a lot less secretive lately. Although we’ve seen professional racers on unreleased products for years, some brands are putting those products on open display.</p>\n<p>Specialized and Pivot have been famously candid about the lugged carbon DH bikes that appeared on 2023 race courses. Including when one of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tPH7yRzhRW8\" target=\"_blank\">Pivot’s prototype frames failed</a> while the world watched. Nevertheless, if it’s only Pivot and Specialized prototyping with lugged carbon, It’s clear that Pivot is putting in extra effort.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-27.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-27.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-27.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-27.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-25.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-25.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-25.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-25.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-08.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-08.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-08.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-08.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The carbon tubes they’re using in their lugged prototypes have shapes that are similar to what will eventually see production. Specialized’s pre-production lugged carbon frame, as well as Framework and Atherton’s <i>production</i> lugged carbon frames, use round tubes. Those are much simpler to produce and size, but don’t paint the full picture when it comes to ride feel. That’s why Pivot machined their own unique shaped molds for each tube on each prototype frame. And that’s kinda expensive.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-12.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>US Assembly</h3>\n<p>This is a bit inside baseball, but many big brands who manufacture overseas have their frames transferred from the factory to a separate assembly facility for component installation and final boxing. Then, they’re shipped to distributors in their destination region. Most small and mid-sized brands like Evil, Ibis, and Pivot instead do the assembly in the destination region’s brand headquarters.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-17.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-17.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-17.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-17.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-16.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-16.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-16.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-16.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-3.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-3.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>It’s an involved process that goes all the way down to applying decals to the fork that match the frame. Paying an employee to do this at a western-hemisphere Pivot headquarters is more expensive, <a href=\"https://www.bicycleretailer.com/opinion-analysis/2025/01/27/low-cost-labor-red-herring-or-elephant-room-when-it-comes-bike-making\" target=\"_blank\">but there’s more to it.</a> Those overseas assembly plants are in closer proximity to component manufacturers, which can make things quicker and easier. Also, larger-volume brands are able to integrate more automation and general efficiency than brands like Pivot. Although tasks are divided among multiple mechanics when assembling locally, the process still resembles a bike shop more than it does an assembly line.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-22.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-22.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-22.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-5.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-5.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-4.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-15.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, there are a few reasons that assembling in-house is more economical for brands that operate on Pivot’s scale. Importing a complete bicycle carries a heftier tax than importing frames and components individually. Also, it can allow small- to mid-sized brands more mobility. That’s different for large brands, whose overseas facilities are already there in the trenches, so the mobility advantage is to be where the action is. But when you’re working in more limited numbers and more limited markets, domestic assembly can add agility if demands change. Again, this is not unique to Pivot. But it is kinda expensive.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-10.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-14.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-14.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-14.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-13.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-13.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-13.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-20.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-20.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/why-are-pivot-bikes-so-expensive-20.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Everything Else</h3>\n<p>All this talk about “scale” hints at why Pivot isn’t bending over backward to offer more full-suspension mountain bikes in the mid-$4,000 range. I pick that still very high number because Pivot is committed to carbon, whereas even Giant can barely crack $5K. But Giant (and Yeti and Santa Cruz) use a slightly heavier and easier-to-work with carbon for their less-expensive bikes. It just doesn’t make sense for Pivot to try to capture that market.</p>\n<p>They’re too busy fiddling with tube diameters to suit lighter riders, or sourcing black-oxide-coated pivot bearings so they don’t show corrosion, or folding sheets of paper around components for their 100% plastic-free bike packaging, or airbrushing blemishes that occur during manufacturing, or <em>still supporting</em> a DH race team. Not everything Pivot does will matter to every rider. But it’s all got a purpose, and it’s all kinda expensive.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/why-pivot-bikes-are-so-expensive/\">The Dust-Up: This Is Why Pivot Bikes Are So Expensive</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Engel","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"726f5331f9dbe59f6fb0a416502ff9c2e0eabd40b4d5602561217f3c74227999","category":"Cycling"}
