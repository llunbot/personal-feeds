Troy Baker, the original voice of Joel in <em>The Last of Us</em>, <a href=\"https://ew.com/indiana-jones-troy-baker-the-great-circle-exclusive-8426963\">picks up the role</a> of the archaeologist.</p>\n<p>From the trailer, <em>Great Circle</em> looks a lot like the modern <em>Wolfenstein</em> games that Machine Games made—and that's a good thing. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=009773542741016272635:e6s_fsvpe7o&amp;q=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/05/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review-satisfying-straightforward-nazi-hunting/&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjk2vrt8ueDAxWeFFkFHVhvDOkQFnoECAMQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw0SEnsd0dI8zIIBAI5Ioxn_\"><em>The New Order</em></a> and <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-review-a-few-bumps-on-the-road-to-epic-combat/\">The New Colossus</a> </em>excelled at making you feel more like a human action hero than a shooting tank. They've got a knack for first-person platforming, stunts, and cinematic moments that are nowhere near as painful as in many shooters. They excel at balancing immersing you as a player and letting your character have a personality.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997200#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997200&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"75cc3f311f1bacc3c72e7ac5733f8378a0eddbbeaf54d269a7fa1af6e08875ab","category":"Tech"}
