Farley revealed the existence of this new platform during the automaker's quarterly financial results call with investors on Tuesday evening. The company is rethinking its electrification strategy, having now faced up to the reality that the current crop of EVs are too expensive for mass-market adoption to take off.</p>\n<p>Ford was early to market with its Mustang Mach-E crossover, itself the product of a skunkworks-style development process: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/heres-everything-we-know-about-the-electric-ford-mustang-mach-e/\">an internal group called Team Edison</a>, formed to add some excitement to what was originally going to be a more boring compliance car. The team also took the bold step of making a fully electric version of the country's best-selling vehicle, the F-150 pickup truck.</p>\n<p>Demand for the electric F-150 Lightning appeared strong, but <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/ford-kills-some-f-150-lightning-trims-raises-prices-on-others/\">a series of price hikes</a> has resulted in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/a-week-with-a-ford-f-150-lightning-this-truck-is-too-big-for-city-life/\">really expensive trucks</a> languishing on dealer forecourts and Ford <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/ford-will-cut-f-150-lightning-production-in-half-in-light-of-weaker-demand/\">cutting production shifts</a> to reduce output. The Mustang Mach-E is still selling, although with <a href=\"https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Q4-2023-Kelley-Blue-Book-Electric-Vehicle-Sales-Report.pdf\">barely any growth year on year</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001558#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001558&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
