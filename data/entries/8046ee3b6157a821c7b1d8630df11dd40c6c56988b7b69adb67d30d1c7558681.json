But sometimes, you will be locked out of your iPhone without passcode due to some particular situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you continue to learn solutions to solve the locked iPhone problem, let‚Äôs take a look at some situations where the iPhone gets locked accidentally:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Forgot iPhone Passcode</strong> ‚Äì You reset your password some time ago and forgot the new one.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cracked iPhone Screen</strong> ‚Äì Your iPhone has a cracked or broken screen.

If you are really desperate to find a perfect solution to fix the unlocking problem quickly, it is strongly recommended to use <a href=\"https://mobi.easeus.com/unlock-iphone/\">EaseUS MobiUnlock</a>, which is a professional screen unlocker solution for iOS.

The underlying logic for unlocking an iPhone in iTunes is very similar to the EaseUS tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with iTunes, you‚Äôll need to manually <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263&amp;xcust=1-1-2008522-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">put iPhone in recovery mode</a> first, while EaseUS MobiUnlock can set iPhone into recovery mode screen automatically once you connect your iPhone to a computer. Here‚Äôs how to unlock iPhone passcode using iTunes on computer without Wi-Fi (around 10 mins):</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download the latest version of iTunes on your Windows or Mac (macOS Mojave or earlier)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2. </strong>Put your iPhone in recovery mode manually.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>For iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, and later, use the side button.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus use the Volume down button.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For iPhone SE (1st generation), and iPhone 6s and earlier use the Home button.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2VKh818ZNAex6n4J0a_wSpNeECRWp9TYXqRo84eSPuERhkg71dIAQHCcEwbO0TiaWlvI8yYzPhJkDZGg2TdNz9ry0s369ZtybKjGkvjq0jywzm08lJrT5e95ijUE5Ti0KqoLcKIGY3JvDMKdQIJ2YQ\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3. </strong>Press and hold the button and don‚Äôt let it go. Now connect your iPhone to your computer via USB cable at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> In iTunes, click the Device icon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Under Summary, select Restore iPhone to restore all the data and settings to their original status.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wDd5h0qQYr0VbSiNfqZToR9QXagd3o7ONxkwks9VFhKhtm8KA6rH9vAsS7IQEiecDVvSj3cDvUdEGKngSBxwtgr0xv42gZ6b4Gu04DoctGzcdtaJOuPHDQ4Y5iqwJVYVRRopjNx9KUGQq4He4PqOOQ\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>üìù<strong> Note:</strong> If you own a Mac with macOS Catalina or later, you can use Finder instead of iTunes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Method 3. Find My ‚Äì iCloud</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To unlock the lock screen passcode by erasing iPhone, the Find My iPhone feature of iCloud is also a good option. But you need to <strong>make sure that the Find My feature is enabled</strong> on your locked iPhone device or the Find My service can‚Äôt detect your iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To bypass the iPhone lock screen via Find My, follow the steps below (around 10 mins):</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1. </strong>On a computer, open a browser and go to iCloud.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Sign in with your Apple ID account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Click the ‚ÄúFind iPhone‚Äù icon to continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click all devices associated with this iCloud account, and then select your locked iPhone model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 5. </strong>Click ‚ÄúErase iPhone‚Äù and complete the on-screen instructions to erase the iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 6. </strong>Wait for the unlocking process to complete.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xEc0Ddtgd7HIeFZFBP4muL_tKhXSHbe0_MQPev5ceVbUWuzPGERjPLHF4r7ujEo6dNd4i3Z7SjRzrowQ71V2G8e13XdJXOwMAM6YBTgfD30bRhEH_2CVBvrtVB64jX8Wl0OCyWcJDTFuVZCLsKH-OA\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>How to Unlock iPhone Without Passcode Without Computer or iTunes</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are reluctant to unlock iPhone without passcode using computer or iTunes, then you can also perform some operations on the device itself to unlock the iPhone screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>üìù <strong>Note:</strong> Unlocking iPhone without passcode without computer or iTunes is feasible, but it may not work as well as the three mentioned using computer above. Anyway, it‚Äôs still worth trying.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Method 1. The Erase iPhone Feature</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To erase iPhone data to remove the locked screen, you can perform some operations on the locked iPhone directly. Make sure your iPhone is running iOS 15.2 or later and it‚Äôs connected to Wi-Fi or a cellular signal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now perform the following steps to<strong> remove iPhone passcode when you forgot it</strong> (around 15 mins or more):</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> On the locked screen, enter possible passcodes several times until the Erase iPhone option appears on the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Tap Erase iPhone twice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3. </strong>Enter your Apple ID password to verify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4. </strong>Wait for the erasing process to complete and restart to set up your iPhone.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tGHePDwPZSKn22DayIn3q_AJ5OI4I8gVjX5AjJ8c-nxhdc32wHJvGpMp1jXamSPqZkhSxKb1cWKG0Ej3TJsnDhIz7lQnIJkwrtM31sRaY2ugla34v2SV-5RykXTOVcZ4Dst9LsbDqZXtaAzYWR8OxA\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>üìù <strong>Note: </strong>There‚Äôs no official data on how many times you need to enter the wrong passcodes before the Erase iPhone option is displayed clearly, some users need to enter 20 times, and some users say it takes 30 times or more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Method 2. Siri</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever heard that voice control can be helpful to fix the iPhone-screen-locked problem? That‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs feasible to unlock iPhone without passcode using Siri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you need to check your iOS system and make sure it‚Äôs running iOS 8-iOS 10.1. Then you can follow the steps below to use voice control to <strong>unlock iPhone without passcode without resetting</strong> (around 15 mins or more):</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1. </strong>Activate Siri and ask it ‚ÄúWhat is the time now?‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2. </strong>Tap the clock icon once it shows the actual time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3. </strong>Click ‚Äú+‚Äù to add a new clock. Then type some casual words in the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4. </strong>Long-press the words to select them all. Then select ‚ÄúShare‚Äù &gt; ‚ÄúMessages.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 5. </strong>Type some words into the ‚ÄúTo:‚Äù field box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 6. </strong>Tap the ‚Äú+‚Äù in the ‚ÄúTo:‚Äù box to add this address as a new contact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 7. </strong>Select ‚ÄúCreate New Contact‚Äù.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 8. </strong>Tap add photo &gt; Choose Photo to navigate to the Photos Library screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 9.</strong> When you‚Äôre in the Photos Library screen, simply press the Home button to navigate to the home screen. Wow! Your iPhone lock screen is just bypassed successfully!</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MjllZy2RgbHFaSWoLw2nOfiFajRxtO4Px9ed1t8TO47qHphplBb7wFh6NKpitbS39B-Td6ha3e779OqGEZaLbD1QoMP844_bFAZsoot3abIm-f42aknqcI7i8bLTZC_Tp2TZcO-XbFxYCKypPyKiIA\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>üìù <strong>Note:</strong> This method will unlock the iPhone passcode without losing data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Method 3. Apple Watch or Apple Store</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For security reasons, you must have wondered if there is any official way for Apple to unlock an iPhone when you forgot the passcode. Actually yes. If you have an Apple Watch Series 3 or later with watchOS 7.4 or later, then you can simply raise and glance at your iPhone to unlock your iPhone with Apple Watch. The prerequisite is that you have set Face ID before.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FkYNZgOv_G5N9t3d5aSgW1D2yacX-vad9d92hernMDhYkxKgJr0rd1nL6LNxTliZUYCKJGILeJvus47_3_0SsYj-_f11LoxVz48d08W7LwdDEx2Zi9D6ZYOepOkjFKmc2zQresedqyyVVRQrVfsbtQ\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, you can contact the local Apple Store and ask their professional suggestions. Maybe you need to send your locked iPhone to the local Apple Store for lock screen removal.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>How to Use Popular TikTok Methods for Unlocking iPhone</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, some TikTok users said that it‚Äôs feasible to unlock an iPhone with a calculator. Then can we really unlock iPhone without passcode or Face ID with Calculator? <strong>The answer is No.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a locked screen, there‚Äôs no more option for you to operate. You can only swipe down to open the Control Center to enable/disable some settings. In addition, someone said that they can unlock iPhone without passcode using Camera. <strong>That‚Äôs also a rumor.</strong> In fact, this means you unlock your iPhone by opening Camera and using the Face ID for recognition to unlock the device. You can bypass Android lock screens using Camera but it doesn‚Äôt work on iPhones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In conclusion, these videos on TikTok are very popular but not helpful at all.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Bonus: Does Factory Reset Delete Everything on iPhone?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Several of the most effective ways to unlock your iPhone involve an iPhone factory reset. Note that <strong>a factory reset would delete everything</strong> stored on the device. Therefore, whether you use EaseUS MobiUnlock, Find My, iTunes, or the on-screen Erase iPhone feature, all the data (including photos, videos, music, documents, and other content) will be wiped after a factory reset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to bypass iPhone passcode without losing data. One is using Siri as mentioned above. Another way is to restore the iPhone backup after a factory data reset. Make sure you‚Äôve backed up before a factory reset.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TceIF4zDRljRSMBV9p_LTEq9UC3FD71WPaOqafsCzylKGNtxmDKuXWT1HPm8tVD6VVqSuCY4-VOv2wFdS49OR_ySlWYfWmI5-cXZ_MSxjaQG1KxqL-MFFVAva916ZgZm48pnNI7Q03bMwm22qZyisA\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we recommend a free iPhone data transfer tool ‚Äì <a href=\"https://mobi.easeus.com/phone-transfer/mobimover-free.html\">free EaseUS MobiMover</a>. With this reliable tool, you can back up, transfer, and restore iPhone data at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Conclusions and FAQs</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we have talked about how to unlock iPhone without passcode in a complete guide. And you can choose to unlock iPhone passcode or Face ID with/without a computer. In addition, you can also <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670996/how-to-unlock-an-iphone.html\">remove SIM lock on iPhone</a> if it‚Äôs locked due to a new SIM card.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, it is recommended to use EaseUS MobiUnlock to remove the iPhone screen passcode or the Apple ID password. EaseUS has been working for decades to bring better products to iOS users and you don‚Äôt have to worry about the risk of security and privacy exposure of the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some questions and answers that Apple users have encountered that you can take a look at:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Can I bypass passcode on iPhone 12 with Siri?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No. Only when your iPhone is running from iOS 8 to iOS 10.1 can you unlock iPhone without passcode using Siri. However, iPhone 12 comes with iOS 14. So, it‚Äôs not possible to bypass passcode on iPhone 12 with Siri or voice control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Should I use Finder or iTunes to restore my iPhone?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you own a Windows PC or a Mac with macOS Mojave or earlier, you can download iTunes to back up and restore your iPhone. While Finder is your alternative if your Mac has been upgraded to macOS Catalina or later. With the introduction of macOS Catalina, Finder has progressively taken the position of iTunes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Can I recover photos on my iPhone after a factory reset?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can restore photos after a factory reset on your iPhone using iCloud, iTunes, and EaseUS MobiMover as long as you back up these data before a factory reset.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. How do I unlock my iPhone if my Face ID fails?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the Face ID isn‚Äôt working on your iPhone or iPad, you can reset it as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Open the Settings app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Face ID &amp; Passcode &gt; Reset Face ID.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap Set up Face ID to reset it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can‚Äôt access your iPhone due to the unidentifiable Face ID, then you can remove the Face ID forcibly using EaseUS MobiUlock.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Can you unlock an iPhone Face ID while sleeping?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. If you are worried that someone could possibly unlock your iPhone with your Face ID while you‚Äôre sleeping, then you can go to Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode. Under Attention, toggle on ‚ÄòRequire Attention for Face ID‚Äô which means you need to look at the iPhone to unlock the screen.</p>\n\nApple Inc, iPhone, Personal Software, Security Software and Services</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8046ee3b6157a821c7b1d8630df11dd40c6c56988b7b69adb67d30d1c7558681","category":"Apple"}
