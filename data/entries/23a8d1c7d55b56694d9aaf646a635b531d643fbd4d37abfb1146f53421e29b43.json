Yes, the Giro d’Italia 2025 gets underway on Friday 9th May, with the first of three opening stages in Albania. From there, the peloton will snake their way up the Italian mainland, tackling the iconic Mortirolo and Colle delle Finestre en route to a Roman finale on Sunday 1st June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several former champions are heading out to the Balkans for the Grande Partenza this week, with Primož Roglič, Richard Carapaz and Jai Hindley all confirmed. Alongside them, Juan Ayuso, Antonio Tiberi and Mikel Landa will start as favourites for the coveted <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-why-jersey-pink\"><em>maglia</em> <em>rosa</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In preparation for this year’s Corsa Rosa, we’ve put our heads together in an attempt to predict the 2025 Giro d’Italia, from GC picks to rogue calls. Whatever you do though, don’t use this as advice for gambling tips. We rarely get them all right.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Pete Muir, editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2206551194-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Team Bora's Primoz Roglic celebrates winning the 4th stage of the 2025 Volta a Catalunya cycling tour of Catalonia, a 188,7 km race between Sant Vicenc de Castellet and Montserrat, on March 27, 2025.

Roglič is likely to romp to the win, add it to his other pink jersey and four red jerseys, and then wonder yet again about what might have been on that final stage time-trial up the Planche des Belles Filles at the Tour in 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Points classification: Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With no Jonathan Milan this year, I reckon the points jersey won’t go to a pure sprinter but to a Classics-guy-who-can-sprint-kind-of-rider, like Mads Pedersen or Wout van Aert. And of those two, Pedersen looks to be the man in form.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mountains classification: Primož Roglič (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The mountains jersey can go one of two ways: to the GC winner who takes it by accident on the way to the overall, or to some chancer who gets in a lot of breaks and somehow hangs on to it all the way to Madrid (2022’s mountains jersey winner was Koen Bouwman – remember him? Exactly). So let’s stick with Roglič.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Youth classification: Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s young (just 21, bless him), likes to win things and has a great team. He’d be the next big thing if he wasn’t cursed to ride at a time when next big things are ten-a-penny.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus prediction: Chaos in Albania</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Who’d have thought?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an attempt to showcase Albania’s tourist highlights, someone will have the bright idea of starting the Stage 2 time-trial in the middle of a museum in Tirana, resulting in multiple crashes on the polished floors and the destruction of various priceless artefacts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+4\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the world's best cycling magazine, delivered to your door, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-4-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Martin James, production editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-28-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-28-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-28-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-28-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-28-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-28-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-28-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-28-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-28-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-28-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-28.webp 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Oman Cycling Association/Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin was the last one to submit his predictions, so if he gets them right it doesn’t count.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>General classification: Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tadej Pogačar’s frankly ludicrous form this year may have hogged the headlines for UAE Team Emirates XRG, but Juan Ayuso has been ticking along nicely himself in 2025 and looks poised to step out of Pogačar’s shadow at the Giro and join him as a Grand Tour winner. Yes, he narrowly lost out to fellow GC favourite Primož Roglič the last time the two went head-to-head at the Volta a Catalunya in March. And yes, this is Ayuso’s debut appearance Giro. But with an experienced team around him, he should be well protected over the race’s opening fortnight to set up a push for the <em>maglia rosa</em> in the final week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Points classification: Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease a Bike)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Olav Kooij was my prediction for the points jersey last year, and indeed he was just starting to hit top form with a victory on Stage 9 when illness forced him to abandon the next day. So 12 months later we go again, this time with Wout van Aert on hand to lead the Visma train and tee Kooij up for intermediate sprints and stage wins.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mountains classification: Primož Roglič (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Roglič is probably the best climber in the 2025 Giro field on paper, but he’s never won the mountains prize at a Grand Tour before. And while I’ve predicted him to fall just short to Juan Ayuso in the battle for GC honours, Roglič is likely to build his campaign around attacks in the high mountains, and that’s where the big KOM points are up for grabs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Youth classification: Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A win by default since I’ve predicted Ayuso to win the overall, so let’s take it a step further and predict Ayuso’s Emirates teammate Isaac del Toro to finish runner up for the white jersey and in the top ten overall in the final standings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus prediction: Romain Bardet to win a stage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As he counts down the days to his retirement next month, gone are the days of Romain Bardet the GC contender or regular summit finish threat. But Romain Bardet the cycling romantic may still have enough in the tank to give us one last feel-good story before he hangs his wheels up for good by claiming a first Giro stage in the final Grand Tour of his career.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-climbs-2025\">The key climbs of the Giro d’Italia 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-favourites\">Who are the favourites for the Giro d’Italia 2025?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-giro-ditalia\">How to watch the Giro d’Italia 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Giro d’Italia 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch and start list</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Will Strickson, web editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"662\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2201098122-min-970x662.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2201098122-min-970x662.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2201098122-min-300x205.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2201098122-min-768x524.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2201098122-min-1536x1048.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2201098122-min-2048x1397.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2201098122-min-750x512.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/GettyImages-2201098122-min-1140x778.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Billy Ceusters/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Will backed Adam Yates for GC glory at last year’s Tour and Vuelta. He’s seen the light and swapped him out for a certain former ski jumper.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>General classification: Primož Roglič (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No risk, no glory, eh? Primož Roglič is risking any (very slim) chance he had of winning the Tour de France this year by doubling up with the Giro – where he’ll surely be tasting glory once he dispatches with Juan Ayuso. I’m a big Ayuso fan but Roglič recently showed his class at the Volta a Catalunya, beating the young Spaniard by almost 30 seconds. Add to that the new Red Bull bonus seconds feature (Roglič is a magnet for time bonuses and his team is sponsored by…) and this one is going to be over quicker than you can say ‘the Colle delle Finestre has been removed from the race due to snow’.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Points classification: Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease a Bike)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mads Pedersen will turn into prime Wout van Aert to win points, as he’s already shown this season at Paris-Nice. Thankfully Visma-Lease a Bike have brought Van Aert in search of redemption after a tough year or so, but he won’t be doing the sprinting. Instead, it’ll be Dutchman Olav Kooij, who’s in a contract year and looking to drive up his value before any new contracts are signed. He’s considerably better than Pedersen in a flat sprint, and where Mads may look to claw back on hillier stages or in breakaways, Visma should be sending Van Aert to limit his supply.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mountains classification: Christian Scaroni (XDS Astana)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before Tadej Pogačar romped home in 2024, the previous Giro KOM winners were Thibaut Pinot (2023), Koen Bouwman (2022), Geoffrey Bouchard (2021), Ruben Guerreiro (2020) and Giulio Ciccone (2019). That leads me to believe that without the domination of Pogačar, this one will go to an outsider once again. So rule out any GC hopefuls or domestiques. There are several tempting options, but I’m going to go for Christian Scaroni. XDS-Astana have been mopping up the points this year and that’s only going to continue here. They’ve brought a strong squad with Lorenzo Fortunato and Wout Poels looking ready to take up two spots in the GC top ten, leaving Christian Scaroni to take lift-off. He was going well in this competition before he dropped out in 2024, and started this season in the best form of anyone in the peloton. A nasty crash put his season on pause but he returned in time to find the form for this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Youth classification: Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully for Juan Ayuso, Roglič is 35, so he’s out of contention for this one, so with second overall incoming for the UAE leader, he’ll dominate this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus prediction: Georg Steinhauser Guillaume Martins his way into the top ten</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>EF’s Georg Steinhauser was one of the stories of the 2024 race, showing excellent climbing ability in the breakaways, even taking a stage win off Pogačar. He’ll continue his development in the breaks once again with Richard Carapaz going for GC, except with no Pog to chase him down, the German will find some chunky time gaps over the favourites and he’ll end up ninth overall in Rome.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Laurence Kilpatrick, staff writer </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/GettyImages-2143599945-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It won’t take long for Laurence to mention his Dani Martínez pick from last year’s Giro.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>General classification: Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The warm glow emanating from my correct flagging of Dani Martínez’s impressive showing at last year’s Giro isn’t enough for me to give him another roll of the dice this time around. There must be some sharp GC elbows in the Bora bus right now with Roglič, Martínez and Hindley all jostling to be the team’s most protected rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might open the way for Juan Ayuso of UAE to take advantage and plod stoically into pink. The fact he’s got a decent TT record – even besting Pippo Ganna at last year’s Tirreno-Adriatico – is very helpful, considering the two ITT’s in this year’s route.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Points classification: Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As ever, I wouldn’t want to be a sprinter at the Giro (or anywhere else for that matter). While there are opportunities in the first week, with Stage 4 to Lecce offering particularly appealing topography, some of the flattish stages still have some pretty hellish climbing involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To that end, and with some very Classicsy terrain mixed in there, I think Mads Pedersen has a good chance of being in the mix on a number of stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mountains classification: Derek Gee (Israel Premier-Tech)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a close one between two guys from across the respective ponds after their excellent showing in the Tour of the Alps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aussie Michael Storer picked up the overall GC win there, but for me this has <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/derek-gee-interview\">Derek Gee</a> written all over it. We’ve seen a lot of GC winners winning the mountains jersey by default in recent years – so Derek will hope he is in the mix for both.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Youth classification: Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on my GC prediction, I can’t look past Mr Ayuso for the young rider jersey too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Away from that dazzling light, local hero Antonio Tiberi is certainly poised to be involved at the sharp end of the racing, and while Josh Tarling won’t trouble the GC standings, hopefully he can pull something special out of the bag in the TTs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus prediction: A rosy Tom Pidcock</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t go through this without mentioning friend of the magazine and podcast <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tom-pidcock-profile\">Tom Pidcock</a>, whose Q36.5 team have been handed a wildcard to compete at the Giro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your eyes peeled for the rejuvenated Yorkshireman to go into pink at the end of Stage 3. After a reduced bunch sprint on Stage 1, and holding his own in the TT without losing much time, Pidders’ descent off the Qafa e Llogarasë in Albania will tee up a significant solo break and a big enough victory to take the jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ewan Wilson, staff writer</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-64-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-64-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-64-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-64-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-64-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-64-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-64-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-64-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-64-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-64-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Cyclist-Mens-Race-Paris-Roubaix-13-avril-2025-64-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I only managed to predict one Grand Tour champion correctly last year. Luckily, I’m jumping on the Roglič bandwagon (like everyone else it seems).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>General classification: Primož Roglič (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you’re not getting sick of hearing the Slovenian national anthem, because I’m backing Roglič for this year’s Giro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 victor will go into the Italian race with a stellar team around him and an abundance of Roglič-friendly stage finishes and a hefty amount of time-trialling on his side too. Given that we’re outside France’s magnetic field, Roglič should be able to stay upright throughout the three weeks. However, that didn’t stop him from finding a way to come a cropper when he won here in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Points classification: Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve seen enough evidence this spring to confidently deduce that Mads Pedersen is in tip-top form. Going off this, he’s overtaken Wout van Aert in my books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lidl-Trek have a ton of momentum coming into this Giro, scoring the second-biggest UCI points haul so far in 2025. The pressure’s off for Pedersen, but a second consecutive <em>maglia</em> <em>ciclamino</em> for the team would be the cherry on top of the cake. Or should I say, the cream on top of the tiramisù?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mountains classification: Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Through gritted teeth, I admit that I don’t think Simon Yates is going to stick around in the fight for GC. Yates has often given us glimmers of form before the Giro, but this year, there’s been nothing of the sort. I mean, he’s barely raced at all in 2025, instead collecting Hilton Reward Points on altitude camps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once out of the frame, Yates will be allowed to shoot up the <em>maglia</em> <em>azzurra</em> standings – something he’s never won before at the Giro. With Vingegaard duties looming at the Tour, a couple of breakaway wins and a mountains jersey may be some individual payoff before he morphs into a luxury domestique in the French Alps come July.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Young riders classification: Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>White’s not quite pink, is it? In my eyes, that’s what Juan Ayuso is going to have to settle for in Rome. After missing out on the top step of the overall podium, he’ll remain in the mix to land UAE Team Emirates XRG yet another Grand Tour podium finish. Oh yes, and win the white jersey too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus prediction: Stage 1 goes to an underdog</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, the Giro will get underway with a road stage – this time from Durrës to Tirana. In the past, we’ve seen a fair few surprises on day one. Think of Lukas Pöstlberger in 2017, Jhonathan Narvàez last year and Romain Bardet at last summer‘s Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s opening stage isn’t tough enough for GC riders to make any ripples in the standings and the lumpy terrain may cast some sprinters out of the fray. With this, expect a lucky breakaway or a rogue name to come out on top in Tirana.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Robyn Davidson, editorial assistant</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-970x647.png\" alt=\"richard carapaz in breakaway at tour de france 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Time for a break from all the Roglič propaganda, Robyn’s going all in on UAE Team Emirates XRG.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>General classification: Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be the Giro d’Italia of Juan Ayuso. In a team stacked with talented riders like João Almeida, Jhonatan Narváez and Adam Yates but dominated by world champion Tadej Pogačar, it can be hard for anyone else to breach the surface for some airtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ayuso heads to the Giro with an overall victory at Tirreno-Adriatico and second place at Volta Catalunya in the bag and is on co-leadership duties with Yates. This is only the 22-year-old’s fourth Grand Tour having placed third and fourth at the Vuelta a España and not finishing the Tour last year. The Giro is a new hunting ground but one he won’t need too much adjustment to get to grips with. After all he dominated the Giro Next Gen in 2021, winning the race overall and also sweeping up the mountains classification and the young rider classification. Now it’s just a case of translating this to the elite level.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Points classification: Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lidl-Trek approach the race with a two-pronged attack: Giulio Ciccone on general classification and Mads Pedersen for sprints, stage wins and an eye on an early <em>maglia rosa</em>. Six flat stages are on offer but Pedersen can win big when the road gets bumpy and pure sprinters fall off, with eight hilly days also to contend for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also the sprint points and the Red Bull KM (more on that later) to contend with – and as a man that has already topped the points standings at a Grand Tour in the Vuelta, he should be aiming to repeat the feat this year. Especially with the added motivation of no Tour de France for the first time since 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mountains classification: Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard Carapaz is no stranger to winning at the Giro, taking home the Trofeo Senza Fine in 2019 for Movistar. He may not sit on the same rung as Ayuso and Roglič this year but do not discount the Ecuadorian, a fiend in the mountains with classifications from the Vuelta in 2022 and Tour in 2024 to his name. When fighting for the podium, he’ll be soaring up and down the climbs like a rollercoaster.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Young rider classification: Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By default from winning the overall standings. Maybe not as glamorous, but it is what it is nowadays. These pesky Grand Tour-winning youngsters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus prediction: Red Bull KM to determine GC</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What the hell, go on then. The Red Bull KM is a new feature for this year and introduces a special kilometre during 19 of 21 stages (time-trials are excluded) that awards six, four and two seconds as time bonuses for GC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found the 2020 Giro enthralling – the concept of two men heading into the final day on the exact same time astounding. Maybe I’m just longing for this feeling again. I hope the Red Bull KM spices things up a bit. Please.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'stay one step ahead of the pack, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-predictions-2025\">Cyclist’s Giro d’Italia 2025 predictions</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"23a8d1c7d55b56694d9aaf646a635b531d643fbd4d37abfb1146f53421e29b43","category":"Cycling"}
