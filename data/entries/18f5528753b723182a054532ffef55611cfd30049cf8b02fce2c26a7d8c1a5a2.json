Players can relive what it was like to work as a human with not-so historically accurate recreations of jobs that include an office worker, gourmet chef, and store clerk.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe game uses hand tracking for control purposes, which means no controller is required. Hands can be used for interacting with, throwing, and smashing objects.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVacation Simulator is similar to Job Simulator, but it provides a simulated vacation experience. Activities include ice sculpting, swimming, knitting mittens, building snowhumans, doing yoga, painting, taking selfies, and more in forest, mountain, and beach scenes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nVacation Simulator and Job Simulator have previously been available on Steam VR, Oculus devices, and PlayStationVR, and were released in 2019 and 2016, respectively. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nJob Simulator is available from the Vision Pro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> for $19.99, while Vacation Simulator is priced at $29.99.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/job-simulator-vision-pro/\">VR Games Job Simulator and Vacation Simulator Launch on Apple Vision Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vr-games-job-simulator-and-vacation-simulator-launch-on-apple-vision-pro.2427621/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"18f5528753b723182a054532ffef55611cfd30049cf8b02fce2c26a7d8c1a5a2","category":"Apple"}
