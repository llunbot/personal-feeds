Meh is probably the best — and certainly the funnest — daily deal site on the web. Here’s their pitch, in their words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You don’t want the daily deal at <a href=\"https://meh.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=sponsor&amp;utm_campaign=dontwant\">meh.com</a> today. </p>\n\n<p>At least, you probably don’t, statistically speaking. But you \nshould go look. Because if you do want it, you really want it, at \nleast for this price. And the cost of checking is, what, 15 \nseconds of your life? </p>\n\n<p>So go to <a href=\"https://meh.com/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=sponsor&amp;utm_campaign=dontwant\">meh.com</a>. Decide you don’t want what we’re selling. Go \nback tomorrow. That’s the whole game. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/14/meh\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"24add4fa95cc8340d0e2b47297819024ab430ee8d074d49ad3543fc2155a4a76","category":"Tech"}
