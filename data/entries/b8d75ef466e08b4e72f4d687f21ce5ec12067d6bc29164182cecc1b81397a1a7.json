Among them are a redesigned Photos app, new ways to customize your Home screen and wallpaper, new Messages reactions, privacy-related features and dozens of other smaller changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This free software update will bring a raft of interface tweaks, bug fixes, and new features. It’s like getting a new iPhone without paying a penny. In this article, we discuss everything you need to know about iOS 18. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will discuss the latest versions of the beta and how to get your hands on that below and in separate articles. We will also explain when the final version of iOS 18 will come out, how to get it when it does, the models of iPhone that will be able to run iOS 18, and the features that will be added in the new OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated July 8:</strong> The latest <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q&amp;xcust=1-1-2221069-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">newsletter from Mark Gurman at Bloomber</a>g specifies that the more advanced Apple Intelligence features for Siri are coming in iOS 18.4.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18 release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 18 is likely to arrive in the week of Monday, September 16, 2024, although Apple is yet to confirm the release date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023 iOS 17 arrived on Monday, September 18, 2023 so we expect a similar timing for 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past several years, the release of the new version of iOS has been fairly consistent:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iOS 17: Monday, September 18, 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 16: Monday, September 12, 2022 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 15: Monday, September 20, 2021 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 14: Wednesday, September 16, 2020</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 13: Thursday, September 19, 2019</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iOS 12: Monday, September 17, 2018</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the final release comes out, installing iOS 18 will be a breeze. Open the Settings app on your iPhone and go to General &gt; Software Update; iOS will check for any available updates and guide you through the process of installing them. You simply have to follow the instructions, which we explain in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670944/how-to-update-ios-on-your-iphone.html\">iOS updating guide</a>. And it’s easier still if you’ve turned on Automatic Updates, which you can do from the same screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18 beta release date </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple began the beta program soon after it revealed the details of iOS 18 at WWDC. The developer beta is available for anyone who wants to run the beta, but it should be noted that this early beta is very likely to be buggy, so we don’t recommend installing it on a primary device. Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\">How to install the iOS beta on your iPhone</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will release a public beta in July that will be a little more polished than the developer beta, but still likely to be buggy as it is pre-release software. In 2023 Apple Apple released the first public beta of iOS 17 on July 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beta testing will continue even after Apple releases iOS 18 to the general public as Apple develops new features not available at launch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d like to join the beta for the next version of iOS read this: How to join Apple’s beta program and try out new software. If you want to remove the beta from your device read this: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1067004/how-to-remove-ios-beta-iphone.html\">How to remove an iOS beta from your iPhone</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to install the iOS beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to install a developer beta, you need, unsurprisingly, to be a registered Apple software developer, which has both free and paid ($99/£79) versions. Since June 2023 Apple has opened the beta to all registered developers–so everyone can get the earliest possible access to the iOS 16 beta. To sign up for an account and install the developer beta you need only follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download the Apple Developer App from the App Store. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the app and click on Account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Sign In and sign in using your usual Apple ID.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you are logged in you should see the beta in General &gt; Software Update &gt; Beta Updates. You need to be running iOS 16.5 or later for this to work. We cover this process in more detail in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\">How to get the iOS beta article</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365614/should-you-install-the-ios-18-beta.html\">Should you install the iOS 18 beta?</a> Our advice is that rather than installing the developer beta you should install the public beta to avoid too many complications. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">How to join Apple’s beta program</a> for more advice. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18 compatibility: Which iPhones will be able to run iOS 18?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following iPhones get support for iOS 18, the same lineup as iOS 17. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, Pro, Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, Pro, Pro Max </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, Pro, Pro Max </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, Pro, Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, Pro Max </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone XR</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone SE (2nd gen or later)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s likely that some of the coolest new features will not be supported on the older phones, because they lack the hardware necessary (a powerful enough Neural Engine or GPU to run AI stuff, or enough RAM). This is typical of new iOS releases. In 2022, for example, the iPhone 8 and iPhone X missed out on a bunch of cool stuff due to their older processor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is no surprise, therefore, that the hardware requirements are steep for the AI-related features—iPhone 15 Pro or later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 17 did not support iPhone 8 or the iPhone X which came out in 2017, but since those phones are able to run iOS 16, they will continue to get support through security updates for at least another year. With the release of iOS 18 though, Apple may stop supporting iOS 15, which will mean that iPhone 7, 7 Plus, iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, and iPhone SE (1st generation) will no longer get support. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, Apple has provided software updates for the past two versions of iOS. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675021/how-long-does-apple-support-iphones.html\">How long does Apple support iPhones</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read about: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362183/ios-18-vs-ios-17-differences.html\">How iOS 17 and iOS 18 compare</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 18: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There were many new features in iOS 17 including a new app called Journal, Live Voicemail, and a new way to use Stickers, among dozens of other smaller changes. Rumors suggested that iOS 18 would be “one of the biggest iOS updates — if not the biggest — in the company’s history.” It was expected that Apple would showcase some major new AI features. The hardware requirements are expected to be steep—iPhone 15 Pro or later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all the new features will be available at launch. Some features, such as the new categories in Mail, will come “later this year” in a subsequent software update.

Currently, icons can be reordered or put into folders, but always fill the screen from left to right and top to bottom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In iOS 18 users will be able to arrange apps and widgets anywhere on the Home Screen, including right above the dock or framing a wallpaper. It will even be possible to change the lock screen icons or remove them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, App icons and widgets can have a dark or tinted effect to blend in.

Users will also be able to add controls from supported third-party apps into Control Center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it enough?

It will be possible to browse by topics, time, people, memories, trips, Recent Days and People and Pets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new carousel view will present highlights that update each day – featuring favorite people, pets, and places. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iphone-Photos-ios-18.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Photos in iOS 18\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iphone-Photos-ios-18.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iphone-Photos-ios-18.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iphone-Photos-ios-18.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iphone-Photos-ios-18.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Photos in iOS 18\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iphone-Photos-ios-18.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iphone-Photos-ios-18.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iphone-Photos-ios-18.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iphone-Photos-ios-18.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Photos in iOS 18\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iphone-Photos-ios-18.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iphone-Photos-ios-18.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iphone-Photos-ios-18.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/iphone-Photos-ios-18.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Messages</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Messages will gain new ways to express yourself.

Apple Intelligence will only be supported by iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max though. (<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365423/apple-intelligence-cpu-vs-memory-8gb-minimum.html\">Here’s why you’ll need to upgrade your iPhone to get Apple Intelligence</a>, also read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365423/apple-intelligence-cpu-memory-neural-engine-private-cloud-compute.html\">Here’s why newer iPhones and Vision Pro can’t run Apple Intelligence</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hardware requirements are steep—iPhone 15 Pro or later. iPads will need at least an M1 chip or later as will Macs. Apple Intelligence features will mostly be processed on the device, which is different from other platforms where AI processing is done in the cloud. But Apple Intelligence will be able to determine if cloud processing is needed and will use it when appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Intelligence features include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Writing</strong> – Apple Intelligence will help users enhance their writing and communications. Writing Tools are built in systemwide that will offer to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text in writing focused apps such as Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Images</strong> – New image capabilities will also come to M-series Macs. In Image Playground users will be able to create images in three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photos</strong> – A new Memories in Photos feature will create a video from photos and videos based on a description provided by the user. Apple Intelligence will pick out the photos and videos, develop a storyline based on the photos, and arrange them into a movie. In addition, a new Clean Up tool will identify and remove unwanted objects from the background of a photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence FAQ: What it is, what it does, and when you’ll get it</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Siri</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Siri is also getting some AI updates and ChatGPT is to be integrated into Siri. Because some queries will be handled off-device Apple is introducing Private Cloud Compute so that when data is sent to server-based models for processing it is not stored or made accessible to Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the simplest changes to Siri is that it will be easier to type to Siri rather than having to speak to the on-device assistant. Apple may have finally twigged that people don’t always want to talk to their phones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Siri is said to be more “conversational” and natural, with features that “help users in their day-to-day lives.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new smart responses framework will help Siri take into account your own personal details in its replies: like people, companies, calendar events, locations, dates, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later this year, Siri is said to get cross-device media control. So you can talk to Siri on one of your devices to control media playback on another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an update scheduled for early 2025, Siri is said to gain the ability to control nearly any app, with hundreds of possible commands. This feature will start off with single commands for Apple’s own apps and grow to include third-party apps and commands with multiple steps. In addition, Siri will be able to react to and take actions based on what is on your screen.

Rather, they will be released later in 2024 or in 2025 as part of an iOS 18 point release (iOS 18.2 or iOS 18.4, for example).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the more significant features we expect to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365756/ios-18-features-not-available-at-launch.html\">come later in an iOS 18 update</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mail app features –</strong> Auto-categorizing of mail, mail digests, and summaries in your inbox are all features expected later in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Home support for robot vacuums –</strong> The Home app won’t be able to start or stop your Roomba until later in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Drag and Drop between iPhone and Mac –</strong> You’ll be able to see and control your iPhone on your Mac when iOS 18 and macOS 15 are released, but drag-and-drop support between your Mac and iPhone will come in an update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ChatGPT integration –</strong> The ability to call upon ChatGPT when using Apple’s AI tools will likely come later in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advanced Siri features –</strong> Siri features like its ability to see and react to what is on your display, semantic indexing (where Siri knows and uses information from across Messages, Mail, Contacts, and more), and advanced control over apps is all coming in 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, all of the Apple Intelligence features will initially support only American English, and may be limited to only some regions. Additional languages and regions are likely to be available through 2025 and beyond.</p>\n\niOS, iPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b8d75ef466e08b4e72f4d687f21ce5ec12067d6bc29164182cecc1b81397a1a7","category":"Apple"}
