Michelin claims the Pro5’s new tubeless-ready casing design and Gum-X compound combine to deliver a 35% decrease in rolling resistance over the outgoing Pro 4 Service Course.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a5129.webp\" alt=\"A Michelin Pro5 in action during a road ride.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a5129.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a5129-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a5129-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a5129-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a5129-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a5129-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a5129-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>The Michelin Pro5 is offered in all black as well as this “classic” tan-wall.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pro5’s grip in both wet and dry conditions ‘remains outstanding’ and puncture resistance ‘remains excellent’, according to Michelin. Specifically for endurance cyclists, Michelin has emphasized air retention in designing the Pro5’s architecture, so riders can finish that 10-hour ride with just as much tire pressure as they started with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Michelin Pro5, a faster-than-ever tubeless road race tire</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Michelinchart-e1747198910316.webp\"><img width=\"799\" height=\"483\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Michelinchart-e1747198910316.webp\" alt=\"Michelin's chart compares the Pro5 to the Power Protection tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Michelinchart-e1747198910316.webp 799w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Michelinchart-e1747198910316-297x180.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Michelinchart-e1747198910316-120x73.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Michelinchart-e1747198910316-768x464.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>The Pro5 concedes a bit of durability and grip to the Power Protection in order to dramatically decrease rolling resistance.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelin also uses Bead-to-Bead Shield technology in the Pro5 to enhance its longevity, meaning the Pro5 can handle both high-volume training and subsequent racing. Compared to the other tire in Michelin’s ‘Competition’ line – the Power Protection TLR – this new Pro5 has better rolling efficiency and is nearly equal in grip, durability, and puncture resistance – based on testing performed by Wheel Energy, an independent tire testing facility in Finland.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a6748.webp\" alt=\"Two riders use Michelin Pro5 road tires on a ride through a forest.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a6748.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a6748-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a6748-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a6748-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a6748-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a6748-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/i3a6748-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>If going fast all day is your thing, The Pro5 is the tire for you. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve not ridden the Michelin Pro5 just yet, but the Pro 3 and Pro 4 definitely already felt fast and supple with ample grip, so we are confident that Michelin has developed the Pro5 to carry on this tradition of speed and performance. While not yet tested by Bicycle Rolling Resistance, we anticipate the Pro5 should also score well. And we look forward to seeing the test results from this most trusted source.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MichelinPro5real.webp\"><img width=\"792\" height=\"528\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MichelinPro5real.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MichelinPro5real.webp 792w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MichelinPro5real-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MichelinPro5real-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MichelinPro5real-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MichelinPro5real-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pro5.webp\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pro5.webp\" alt=\"Studio shot of the Michelin Pro5 road tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pro5.webp 900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pro5-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pro5-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pro5-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Michelin Pro5 is available in 28, 30, 32, and 35mm widths, with both all-black or “classic” tan sidewall options. At a claimed 365g in a 30mm size, the Pro5 is certainly not ultralight. But with decreased rolling resistance and enhanced durability, it doesn’t appear weight was a priority for Michelin here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Pro5 is available now and retails for $80 / 64€.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.michelinman.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Michelin.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/michelin-pro5-faster-than-ever-tubeless-all-rounder-road-race-tire/\">Michelin Pro5 Road Tire Rolls 35% Faster Than Its Service Course Predecessor</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d23a7ce3f09e57da00855c6093a2670bb90b462595cd9a3999dc0e0a8190b5d9","category":"Cycling"}
