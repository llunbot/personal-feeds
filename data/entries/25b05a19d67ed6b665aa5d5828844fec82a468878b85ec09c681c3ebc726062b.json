Although international major events continue to be challenging, we will celebrate cycling in January 2022 in the best way we know how and welcome visitors to Adelaide once again to kick off the new year,” said Premier of South Australia, Steven Marshall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit Victoria’s press release indicates that the state is exploring options for an international cycling event later in 2022, but provides no further details about what form that may take. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a global context, Australia has dodged the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, with relatively low case levels compared to much of the rest of the world. The country is, however, battling a Delta outbreak across its two most populous states while it simultaneously races to increase vaccination levels to allow a return to some level of normality. South Australia is effectively COVID-free, but has closed its borders to Victoria and New South Wales. </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/tour-down-under-and-cadels-road-race-scrapped-for-2022/\">Read More</a>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"25b05a19d67ed6b665aa5d5828844fec82a468878b85ec09c681c3ebc726062b","category":"Cycling"}
