{"title":"Bob Uecker, Mr. Baseball, Dies at 90","link":"https://defector.com/bob-uecker-was-just-the-best?giftLink=4e90dd98613fd68a7ca54975700e1c5a","date":1737076887000,"content":"\n<p>Ray Ratto, writing for Defector, gets it right. Bob Uecker was just the best:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He was the face and voice of baseball cinema, the man whose\nline-reading made “Ju-u-u-u-st a bit outside” so good that\n“iconic” doesn’t remotely cover its impact. Even if you’re not a\nseamhead, you likely came across Bob Uecker and smiled.</p>\n\n<p>So Thursday’s announcement that Uecker has died at age 90, due to\nsmall cell lung cancer, came as a blow. Nine decades is a good\nlong run, but there was never a sense that he was running out of\nmaterial; Uecker was still a joy to hear on Brewers broadcasts\neven in Year 54 of being the voice of Wisconsin baseball for\ntwo-and-a-half generations. The reaction to his passing was\nunanimous in the same ways and for the same reasons that the\nresponse to Vin Scully’s death was unanimous — it was an\noutpouring of both sadness at the loss and gratitude for all the\ntime we got to spend with him. In an epochally angry time in\nAmerica, at a moment when it isn’t hard to find even anti-puppy\npolemics with a keystroke, Uecker gets a pass from most everyone.\nYes he defined baseball, but he also managed to become more than\nmerely Mister Baseball. From the moment of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JXq_tF4skE\">his first\nappearance</a> on Johnny Carson’s definitive version of the\nTonight Show, which Uecker earned merely by mastering the\ntripartite arts of comedy writing, unabashed self-deprecation, and\nmartini-dry humor, he was recognizable as that rarest of\nAmericans, the guy you’d sit back down to listen to even if you\nwere already halfway out the door. Put another way, Norm Macdonald\nthought he was one of the funniest men he ever met. Beat that with\na stick.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/bob-uecker-dies\">MLB.com has a fine obituary</a> that includes a slew of links and videos. Uecker, 90 years old, was on the call for the Brewers <a href=\"https://ftw.usatoday.com/2025/01/bob-uecker-final-brewers-call-death-mets\">right up until the bitter end of last season</a>, when they fell to the Mets in the 9th inning. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nut_history/status/1879927785306919028\">His final words as a broadcaster</a>: “I’m telling you. That one — had some string on it.” So does this one.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to lose a few hours in laughter, head down the rabbit hole of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=johnny+carson+bob+uecker\">Uecker’s 100-some appearances on Carson</a>. Here’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2ukxCErDkk\">the first one</a> that just came up for me now, a 1976 appearance where Uecker, utterly deadpan as ever, makes Mel Brooks spit out his coffee.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/16/bob-uecker-rip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b0a1bd62ea135dcde79d15eadc7b390d22f75a64516121cbe17edefcd46e8c50","category":"Tech"}
