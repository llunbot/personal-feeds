If you can't swing a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/samsungs-galaxy-s25-event-was-an-ai-presentation-with-occasional-phone-hardware/\">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, Motorola's G Stylus lineup could be just what you need. The new 2025 Moto G Stylus is now official, featuring several key upgrades while maintaining the same $400 price tag.</p>\n<p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 sticks with the style Motorola has cultivated over recent years, with a contoured vegan leather back. It comes in two Pantone colors called Gibraltar Sea and Surf the Web—one is dark blue and the other is a lighter, more vibrant blue. They look like fun colors. Moto's language makes it sound like there could be more colors down the road, too.</p>\n<p>The spec sheet paints a picture of a solid mobile device, but it won't exceed expectations. Motorola moved to a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processor, which runs at a slightly higher clock speed than the Gen 1 it used in the 2024 model. It also has 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage in the base model. An upgraded version with 256GB of storage and the same 8GB of RAM will be available, too.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/the-2025-moto-g-stylus-has-a-sharper-display-and-enhanced-stylus-for-400/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/the-2025-moto-g-stylus-has-a-sharper-display-and-enhanced-stylus-for-400/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bf10a27a7c8722629dccdeada7731a6bf39a326c9878531b9c50af8473844144","category":"Tech"}
