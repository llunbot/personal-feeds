We combined the lightweight UI of a to-do app with the power of enterprise-level issue tracking, all in a native app built by long-time Mac geeks.</p>\n\n<p>Sonar saves all your changes directly to GitHub/GitLab using their official APIs so your data remains secure on their servers — not ours. Team members not using Sonar? No problem. Changes you make in Sonar are 100% compatible with the web UI.</p>\n\n<p>Sonar’s free to try for 14 days — no subscriptions or purchases required! We’d love if you gave it a try.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2024/02/sonar_mac_app_for_githubgitlab\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"Daring Fireball Department of Commerce","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b7e0e3eb60e971ed39f3e43c170a47c5f1e4390a903bef0a289339d88589b9dc","category":"Tech"}
