As with other apps that offer SharePlay, participants need to be subscribed to the MasterClass service, which is priced at $30/month, though there is a 2-for-1 discount at the current time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs with all SharePlay apps, all MasterClass participants will have media controls to play content, pause, and skip forward/backward as needed, with playback synced for everyone in real time. Participants will be able to watch the video playback and discuss the content with one another.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMasterClass was one of the apps that Apple announced as planning integration when SharePlay <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/shareplay-powers-new-ways-to-stay-connected-and-share-experiences-in-facetime/\">first debuted</a> as part of iOS 15.1, and the feature is now available for those who want to use it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSharePlay requires iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, and tvOS 15.1 or later, and as of this week, it is also available on the Mac as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-macos-monterey-12-1/\">part of macOS Monterey 12.1</a>.
