{"title":"Best Prime Day iPhone Deals: July 11, 2023","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/800380/best-prime-day-iphone-deals-july-11.html","date":1689069251000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon holds an Early Access sale in October, but its annual mega-sale is called Prime Day, and that’s when tech enthusiasts look out for good deals on everything from laptops to power adapters. It has gotten to be such a big event that other online retailers often run competing sales around the same time, to try to get a little more business out of all that increased online shopping activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 Prime Day has arrived, and runs across July 11 and 12. During the sale we expect to see Amazon drop the prices for iPhones–but only outside of the U.S. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re in the U.S. the deals don’t tend to be as good as elsewhere. The latest iPhones are rarely discounted <em>anywhere</em> in the U.S, with most sales going to older or refurbished models. Amazon isn’t usually the best place to buy a new iPhone in the U.S. as Amazon’s new iPhones are carrier locked to Cricket Wireless, an AT&amp;T subsidiary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.K., though, you can find the latest iPhones unlocked at Amazon and at other resellers. Supplies can be limited, and there are usually only small discounts for the newest handsets, but you might see some good deals on the older iPhone models such as the iPhone 13 and 13 mini and the iPhone SE. You can see current deals on various iPhones below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to take advantage of the Prime Day deals, you’ll need to be an Amazon Prime member. Amazon Prime costs <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/tryprimefree?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$14.99</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/tryprimefree?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">£8.99</a> / <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/tryprimefree?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">AUD$6.99</a> on a monthly basis, (but can be cancelled after 30 days) and gives you two-day free delivery and access to Prime Video. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prime Day 2023: Best iPhone accessory deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prime Day can be a great time to get iPhone accessories. In 2022 we saw some great discounts, and we hope to see similar in 2023:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086KNLM5M/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Belkin 3-in-1 Wireless Charger: $101.99</a> ($18 off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P544KWF/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Anker 20W Nano Charger with 6ft USB-C to Lightning Cable: $23.99</a> ($6 off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H4KS2LV?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Anker 20W Nano USB-C charger (2 pack): $23.99</a> ($6 off)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prime Day 2023: Best iPhone 14 deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 14 is the most affordable of Apple’s new lineup, and now that the company has dropped its “mini” models, it’s the smallest new iPhone, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Amazon’s October 2022 sale, we didn’t see any iPhone 14 discounts, but now the phone has been on the market for a bit longer we expect money-off opportunities. In fact, you can already save money: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon U.K.:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-iPhone-14-128-GB/dp/B0BDJH7J5C/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 14 (128GB): £764</a> (£85 off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-iPhone-14-128-GB/dp/B0BDJH9ZL1/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 14 (256GB): £874</a> (£85 off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-iPhone-14-128-GB/dp/B0BDJPRT4T/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 14 (512GB): £1,094.99</a> (£84.01 off)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prime Day 2023: Best iPhone 14 Plus deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the larger-screen, larger-battery version of the iPhone 14. Last October we didn’t see any discounts here, but now you can save money so we expect some good deals for Prime Day in July. You can already save £85. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon U.K.:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BDJY2DFH?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 14 Plus (128GB): £864</a> (£85 off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BDHR3BCZ?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 14 Plus (256GB): £974</a> (£85 off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BDJ96YLJ?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 14 Plus (512GB): £1,184.99</a> (£94.01 off)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prime Day 2023: Best iPhone 14 Pro deals </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pro model adds an always-on 120Hz ProMotion display, an improved 48MP camera, LiDAR, and the new Dynamic Island interface. But it costs a lot more. Right now we are seeing these discounts at Amazon in the U.K. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon U.K.:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BDJ61GFY?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 14 Pro (128GB): £969</a> (£130 off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BDJGS72G?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 14 Pro (256GB): £1,079</a> (£130 off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BDHTM36R?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 14 Pro (512GB): £1,299</a> (£130 off)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BDJM988F?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 14 Pro (1TB): £1,509.55</a> (£139.45 off)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Prime Day 2023: Best iPhone 14 Pro Max deals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s biggest and most expensive iPhone.
