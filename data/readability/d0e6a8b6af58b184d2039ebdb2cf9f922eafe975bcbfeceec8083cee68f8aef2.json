Jasper Philipsen and perhaps Wout van Aert are others to watch, and with so many pure speedsters gone, Sonny Colbrelli and Michael Matthews will likely be in the mix as well.</em></p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TDF21_PROFILS-ETAPES-SANS-RAVITO_ETP19.jpeg\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/TDF21_ET19_carte-1340x1895.jpeg\"></figure></div></div>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"d0e6a8b6af58b184d2039ebdb2cf9f922eafe975bcbfeceec8083cee68f8aef2","category":"Cycling"}
