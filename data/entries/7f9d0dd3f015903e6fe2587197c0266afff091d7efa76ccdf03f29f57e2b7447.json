The ship was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/03/long-lost-endurance-shipwreck-found-off-coast-of-antarctica/\">finally found</a> in 2022, nearly 107 years after it sank beneath the ice. The stories of Shackleton's adventures and the 2022 expedition are told in parallel in <em>Endurance</em>, a new documentary from National Geographic now streaming on Disney+.</p>\n<p><em>Endurance</em> is directed by Oscar winners Jimmy Chin and Chai Vasarhelyi (<em>Free Solo</em>). According to Vasarhelyi, she and Chin had been obsessed with the Shackleton story for a long time. The discovery of the shipwreck in 2022 gave them the perfect opportunity to tell the story again for a new audience, making use of all the technological advances that have been made in recent years.</p>\n<p>\"I think the Shackleton story is at the heart of the DNA of our films,\" Vasarhelyi told Ars. \"It's the greatest human survival story ever. It really speaks to having these audacious objectives and dreams. When everyone tells you that you can't, you want to do it anyway. It requires you to then have the actual courage, grit, discipline, and strength of character to see it through. Shackleton is that story. He didn't sensibly achieve any of his goals, but through his failure he found his strength: being able to inspire the confidence of his men.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/endurance-documents-hunt-for-shackletons-shipwreck/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/endurance-documents-hunt-for-shackletons-shipwreck/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7f9d0dd3f015903e6fe2587197c0266afff091d7efa76ccdf03f29f57e2b7447","category":"Tech"}
