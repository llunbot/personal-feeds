Considering most normal adults would consider a double serving an actual portion, including the addition of milk, Surreal’s cereal would see them getting around 40g of protein at breakfast. For muscle growth and repair, it’s an ideal start to the day, and that’s not even factoring in the use of pea starch and inulin (a starch derived from chicory root) to provide plenty of fibre to keep the digestion running smoothly, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Superior nutritional profile aside, unequivocally the biggest draw of Surreal’s cereal is their taste, which has been created using natural sources such as peanut flour, hazelnut paste and cocoa powder.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-13-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Box of surreal cereal\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-13-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-13-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-13-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-13-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-13-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-13-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-13-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-13.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with the natural sweeteners Steviol and Erythritol, Surreal has created eight flavour options. I’ve tried four of them (strictly for journalistic authenticity, you understand) and I can confirm that they taste as good as the sugar-packed equivalents I ate in my childhood, but Surreal says that taste comes without the extra calories or associated energy slump. There’s no denying their high price, but it doesn’t seem unreasonable that you need to pay to get the best of both worlds in nutrition and flavour.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into this week: Growing grass</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Grass\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-10-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/in-the-drops-19-07-24-10.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>This is actually my grass.</figcaption><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m currently in the midst of a garden renovation, and although <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sennheiser-momentum-sport-earbuds\" target=\"_blank\">the digging phase</a> lasted longer than I had anticipated (it’s harder and slower than you think it’s going to be, and the mud seems to triple in volume once out of the ground), two weeks ago the stage was set (quite literally, for my spade skills had indeed rendered a previously lumpy plot into one of stage-like flatness) to progress onto the next step in the plan, which was seeding what would be the lawn space. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A topsoil, compost and seed granola was prepared and spread, tamped down and dutifully watered regularly. Days passed. Signs of germination were awaited eagerly, then impatiently, then desperately. Had I done something wrong? Was the weather to blame? Just when I was ready to write things off and look into getting some turf (which I can’t help but view as the cheat’s way to a lawn, akin to buying a birthday cake for a loved one from the supermarket), earlier this week I awoke to a carpet of green. A pretty threadbare one, I must admit, but like the fluff on the chin of a teenager, it’s getting denser every day. This might be a sign of me getting old(er) and boring(er), but it has been a satisfying project. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to get the mower out.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/madison-code-breaker-ii-sunglasses-review\">Madison Code Breaker II sunglasses review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hammerhead-karoo-3\">New Hammerhead Karoo has new internals and over 15 hours battery life</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/hammerhead-karoo-2-review\">Hammerhead Karoo 2 review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-cycling-sunglasses\">Best cycling sunglasses: look good on the bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/as-a-cyclist-are-you-eating-enough-protein\">As a cyclist are you eating enough protein?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hammerhead-karoo-bike-computer\">In the Drops: Hammerhead’s new Karoo, value packed Madison glasses, muscle-building cereal and grass </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Sam Challis &#124; Tech Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"56879d190c165724e8abab6c4b9927057cdf956e54fdc3b5f52be346145e5636","category":"Cycling"}
