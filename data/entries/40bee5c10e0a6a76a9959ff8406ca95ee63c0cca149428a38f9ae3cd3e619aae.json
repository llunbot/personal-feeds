{"title":"iPad Mini vs. iPad Air Buyer's Guide: 15 Differences Compared","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-vs-ipad-air/","date":1729610160000,"content":"Apple recently introduced the seventh-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, offering the A17 Pro chip, Apple Intelligence support, 8GB of memory, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> Pro and ‌Apple Pencil‌ hover support, and more. Earlier this year, Apple debuted the sixth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, featuring the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip, ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro support, and a larger display size option. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/ipad-mini-vs-air-early-2022.jpg\" width=\"2498\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe ‌iPad mini‌ effectively shares the design of the ‌iPad Air‌, with both devices possessing many of the same features such as an all-screen design with no Home button, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> in the top button, and stereo speakers. Despite theoretically being different product lines, the ‌iPad mini‌ and ‌iPad Air‌ are almost identical in terms of specifications and are even available in the same color options. There are still some minor differences between the devices, such as their display sizes and chips, that set the devices apart.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShould you buy the more expensive, larger ‌iPad Air‌, or opt for the smaller and more affordable ‌iPad mini‌? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two iPads is best for you. All of the differences between the two devices are listed below:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPad mini‌ (seventh generation, 2024)</th>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPad Air‌ (sixth generation, 2024)</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>8.3-inch display with 326 ppi</td>\r<br />\n <td>11-inch or 13-inch display with 264 ppi</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>500 nits max SDR brightness</td>\r<br />\n <td><strong>11-inch</strong>: 500 nits max SDR brightness\r<br />\n<strong>13-inch</strong>: 600 nits max SDR brightness</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Smaller, compact design for maximum portability</td>\r<br />\n <td>Larger design, better for productivity</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Weighs 0.66 pounds (297 grams)</td>\r<br />\n <td><strong>11-inch</strong>: Weighs 1.02 pounds (462 grams)\r<br />\n<strong>13-inch</strong>: Weighs 1.36 pounds (617 grams)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>A17 Pro chip (introduced with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> Pro in 2023, made with TSMC's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a> N3 process)</td>\r<br />\n <td>‌M2‌ chip (introduced with redesigned <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> in 2022, made with TSMC's enhanced 5nm N5P process)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>6-core CPU</td>\r<br />\n <td>8-core CPU</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>5-core GPU</td>\r<br />\n <td>9-core GPU</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td>Dedicated media Engine\r<br />\nHardware-accelerated H.264 and HEVC\r<br />\nVideo decode engine\r<br />\nVideo encode engine</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/stage-manager/\">Stage Manager</a> support</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Volume buttons on top</td>\r<br />\n <td>Volume buttons on right side</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>12MP Ultra Wide front camera</td>\r<br />\n <td>Landscape 12MP Ultra Wide front camera</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>True Tone flash</td>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Compatible with Bluetooth keyboards only</td>\r<br />\n <td><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/\">Smart Connector</a> to support Apple's Magic Keyboard and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-keyboard/\">Smart Keyboard</a> Folio</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage</td>\r<br />\n <td>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Starts at $499</td>\r<br />\n <td><strong>11-inch</strong>: Starts at $599\r<br />\n<strong>13-inch</strong>: Start at $799</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOverall, the ‌iPad Air‌ is the best all-around option for the majority of users, providing a large screen for productivity and consuming entertainment in a slim, portable design. The additional $100 needed to buy the 11-inch ‌iPad Air‌ over the ‌iPad mini‌ is more than justified for the benefits that come with its larger display and ‌M2‌ chip, not least the ability to practically use it as a laptop replacement with the Magic Keyboard and ‌Stage Manager‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYet, most customers who choose the ‌iPad mini‌ will do so because of its screen size rather than in spite of it. The ‌iPad mini‌ is ideal for comfortably reading ebooks, playing handheld games, and easy transport and storage. Those who buy the ‌iPad mini‌ will likely have a specific use case in mind for how they will use the device, such as for note-taking on the go with the ‌Apple Pencil‌, throwing into a small bag to use on public transport, or giving it to a kid as their first tablet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you do not see the ‌iPad mini‌'s smaller display, easy one-handed grip, lightweight design, and portable form factor as an advantage for your use case and are focused on a more versatile display size, you will likely prefer the ‌iPad Air‌, especially as it is now available with a 13-inch size option. The ‌iPad Air‌ is more of an all-around device that works as a potential laptop replacement with support for ‌Stage Manager‌, with the added bonuses that come with a bigger screen for productivity and entertainment.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-vs-ipad-air/\">iPad Mini vs. iPad Air Buyer's Guide: 15 Differences Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-vs-ipad-air-buyers-guide-15-differences-compared.2337402/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"40bee5c10e0a6a76a9959ff8406ca95ee63c0cca149428a38f9ae3cd3e619aae","category":"Apple"}
