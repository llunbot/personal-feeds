{"title":"In the Works – AWS Region in Malaysia","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-region-in-malaysia/","date":1677722775000,"content":"<p>We launched an AWS Region in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-asia-pacific-melbourne-region-in-australia/\">Australia</a> earlier this year, four more (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/a-new-aws-region-opens-in-switzerland/\">Switzerland</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-region-in-spain/\">Spain</a>, the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-region-in-the-united-arab-emirates-uae/\">United Arab Emirates</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-the-30th-aws-region-asia-pacific-hyderabad-region-in-india/\">India</a>) in 2022, and are working on regions in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-canada-west-calgary-region/\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-region-in-tel-aviv-israel/\">Israel</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-region-in-new-zealand/\">New Zealand</a>, and <a href=\"https://press.aboutamazon.com/2022/10/aws-to-launch-an-infrastructure-region-in-thailand\">Thailand</a>. All told, we now have 99 Availability Zones spread across 31 geographic regions.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Malaysia in the Works</strong></span><br /> Today I am happy to announce that we are working on an AWS region in Malaysia. This region will give AWS customers the ability to run workloads and store data that must remain in-country.</p> \n<p>The region will include three Availability Zones (AZs), each one physically independent of the others in the region yet far enough apart to minimize the risk that an AZ-level event will have on business continuity. The AZs will be connected to each other by high-bandwidth, low-latency network connections over dedicated, fully-redundant fiber.</p> \n<p><span><strong>AWS in Malaysia</strong></span><br /> We are planning to invest at least $6 Billion (25.5 billion Malaysian ringgit) in Malaysia by 2037.</p> \n<p>Many organizations in Malaysia are already making use of the existing AWS Regions. This includes enterprise and public sector organizations such as <a href=\"https://www.axiata.com/home\">Axiata Group</a>, <a href=\"https://www.babas.com.my/\">Baba Products</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bankislam.com/\">Bank Islam Malaysia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.digi.com.my/\">Celcom Digi</a>, <a href=\"https://paynet.my/index.html\">PayNet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.petronas.com/\">PETRONAS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tnb.com.my/\">Tenaga Nasional Berhad</a> (TNB), <a href=\"https://www.apu.edu.my/\">Asia Pacific University of Technology &amp; Innovation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity.my/en/index.html\">Cybersecurity Malaysia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dosm.gov.my/v1/\">Department of Statistics Malaysia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mohe.gov.my/en\">Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pos.com.my/\">Pos Malaysia</a>, and startups like <a href=\"https://www.babas.com.my/\">Baba’s</a>, <a href=\"https://www.beed.world/\">BeEDucation Adventures</a>, <a href=\"https://www.carsome.my/\">CARSOME</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.storehub.com/\">StoreHub</a>.</p> \n<p>Here’s a small sample of some of the exciting and innovative work that our customers are doing in Malaysia:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://jcorp.com.my/\"><strong>Johor Corporation (JCorp)</strong></a> is the principal development institution that drives the growth of the state of Johor’s economy through its operations in the agribusiness, wellness, food and restaurants, and real estate and infrastructure sectors. To power JCorp’s digital transformation and achieve the JCorp 3.0 reinvention plan goals, the company is leveraging the AWS cloud to manage its data and applications, serving as a single source of truth for its business and operational knowledge, and paving the way for the company to tap on artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain technologies in the future.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.rtm.gov.my/\"><strong>Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM)</strong></a>, established in 1946, is the national public broadcaster of Malaysia, bringing news, information, and entertainment programs through its six free-to-air channels and 34 radio stations to millions of Malaysians daily. Bringing cutting-edge AWS technologies closer to RTM in Malaysia will accelerate the time it takes to develop new media services, while delivering a better viewer experience with lower latency.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.bankislam.com/\"><strong>Bank Islam</strong></a>, Malaysia’s first listed Islamic banking institution, provides end-to-end financial solutions that meet the diverse needs of their customers. The bank taps AWS’ expertise to power its digital transformation and the development of <a href=\"https://www.getbeu.com/\">Be U</a> digital bank through its Centre of Digital Experience, a stand-alone division that creates cutting-edge financial services on AWS to enhance customer experiences.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.mampu.gov.my/en/\"><strong>Malaysian Administrative Modernization Management Planning Unit (MAMPU)</strong></a> encourages public sector agencies to adopt cloud in all ICT projects in order to accelerate emerging technologies application and increase the efficiency of public service. MAMPU believes the establishment of the AWS Region in Malaysia will further accelerate digitalization of the public sector, and bolster efforts for public sector agencies to deliver advanced citizen services seamlessly.</p> \n<p>Malaysia is also home to both Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and Systems Integrators that are members of the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/partners/\">AWS Partner Network</a> (APN). The ISV partners build innovative solutions on AWS and the SIs provide business, technical, marketing, and go-to-market support to customers.
