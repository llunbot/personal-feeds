This new production capacity will be used by Apple for future OLED MacBooks, according to the report. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>DigiTimes</em> has reported that Apple is tentatively scheduled to release a 16 to 17-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/04/10-9-inch-oled-ipad-early-2022/\">MacBook Pro with an OLED display in 2022</a>. Apple is also reportedly planning a 10.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> and 12.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> with OLED displays for the same year. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple just this year released a new ‌iPad Pro‌ with a mini-LED display and is expected to be just weeks away from launching updated 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros with similar display technology. <em>DigiTimes</em> said that Apple would allow ‌iPad‌ and MacBook models with OLED and mini-LED displays, which are considerably different technologies, to coexist within their respective product lineups. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple currently uses OLED displays in its flagship iPhones, Apple Watch models, and the Touch Bar in the current MacBook Pros. The company has yet to expand OLED technology to other products. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/\">The Elec</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/10/samsung-preparing-2022-oled-macbook-pro/\">Samsung Display Preparing OLED Orders for 2022 MacBook Pro Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-display-preparing-oled-orders-for-2022-macbook-pro-models.2307083/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ajRNYk5Cyog:_qmbntabQ3M:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ajRNYk5Cyog:_qmbntabQ3M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ajRNYk5Cyog\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a941aaa83af1f45debb258b1fe191ee31b73c576f9c38da009f58e1554238d18","category":"Apple"}
