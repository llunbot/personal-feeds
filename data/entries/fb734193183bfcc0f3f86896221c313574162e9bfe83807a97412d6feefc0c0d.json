Apple yesterday <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/\">announced</a> its \"Scary Fast\" event for Monday, October 30, featuring a Finder hint, which virtually confirms the arrival of new Macs. Now, related information provided to <em>MacRumors</em> suggests that new Mac models could launch on Wednesday, November 8 – nine days after the \"Scary Fast\" event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Apple product launches often take place on a Friday, there is precedent for Apple opting for the first Wednesday in November following an October event. For example, at its \"There's more in the making\" event on Tuesday, October 30, 2018, Apple announced new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models. The machines launched on Wednesday, November 7 – eight days later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnalyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> says that Apple's upcoming event <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/kuo-m3-macbook-pro-october-30/\">will focus on</a> new MacBook Pro models with M3 series chips, which could include the 13-, 14-, and 16-inch models with the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips. In addition to these machines, a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> featuring the M3 chip is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-apple-to-announce-new-macs-this-month/\">also on the table</a> for announcement at the event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe M3 chip is widely expected to be fabricated using TSMC's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a> process for performance and efficiency improvements compared to the current, 5nm-based ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a>‌ chip, which debuted in June 2022. It will also likely feature an all new GPU with hardware ray-tracing, first introduced on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>'s A17 Pro chip last month.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/\">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/new-macs-may-launch-on-november-8/\">New 'Scary Fast' Macs May Launch on Wednesday, November 8</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-scary-fast-macs-may-launch-on-wednesday-november-8.2408637/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fb734193183bfcc0f3f86896221c313574162e9bfe83807a97412d6feefc0c0d","category":"Apple"}
