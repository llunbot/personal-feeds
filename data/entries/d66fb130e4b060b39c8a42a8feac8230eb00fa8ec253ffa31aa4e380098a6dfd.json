The two products are slightly different than what we expect from the bike manufacturer but happily welcomed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trek CarBack Radar — What is It?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CarBack_OnSaddle-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CarBack_OnSaddle-1-1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"CarBack_OnSaddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CarBack_OnSaddle-1-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CarBack_OnSaddle-1-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CarBack_OnSaddle-1-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CarBack_OnSaddle-1-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CarBack_OnSaddle-1-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Image: Trek </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By now, we all know how bike radars work; if not, let me crudely explain. The radar detects a vehicle while mounted on the seatpost or saddle. When detected, the radar sends a signal to your head unit or phone and alerts the rider of the approaching vehicle. The head unit or phone will audibly let the rider know through a series of “beeps” of the approaching vehicle. Some head units will show the vehicle’s progress approaching on the side of the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-Road-bike--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1073\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-Road-bike--1536x1073.jpeg\" alt=\"Trek Carback installed Road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-Road-bike--1536x1073.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-Road-bike--297x207.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-Road-bike--120x84.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-Road-bike--768x536.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-Road-bike--2048x1431.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Now that we know what it is and how it works let’s discuss how the Trek CarBack unit addresses radar use and safety.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Trek CarBack unit boasts a slew of features, some best in class, including spotting rear-approaching vehicles up to 240km away. Like other radars on the market, the CarBack runs an any-time visual light that can be seen up to 2km away.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-full-bacl--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-full-bacl--1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"Trek Carback installed full bacl\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-full-bacl--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-full-bacl--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-full-bacl--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-full-bacl--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-full-bacl--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders can choose between a daytime running light with focused optics and an interruptive flash pattern for light patterns—solid lights-on or no-light mode. Users can toggle through these via their head unit or smartphone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Smartphone Integration </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-CarBack_USB_V2-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-CarBack_USB_V2-1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"Trek CarBack_USB_V2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-CarBack_USB_V2-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-CarBack_USB_V2-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-CarBack_USB_V2-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-CarBack_USB_V2-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-CarBack_USB_V2-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Image: Trek </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>CarBack works with GPS head units and Smartphones, so you don’t need a cycling computer to enjoy the safety on your ride into town. For smartphone use, Trek offers a new Accessory App, and riders can choose between audible and visual alerts and can see the exact location of approaching vehicles in real-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unit itself is robust and compact, with ample water-proof features. It is also light enough (100g on our scale) to attach to a seat bag or seatpost without taking up too much real estate.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-green-lights--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1059\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-green-lights--1536x1059.jpeg\" alt=\"Trek Carback installed green lights\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-green-lights--1536x1059.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-green-lights--297x205.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-green-lights--120x83.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-green-lights--768x530.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-green-lights--2048x1412.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Battery life is a major deal for radars because if they run out, you’re out of luck for some extra protection. The Trek CarBack uses a neat, visible battery gauge. The gauge has a four-bar LED battery indicator. This visual aid is much better (IMO) for seeing the charge than checking your headunit. Plus, when the head unit (or phone) senses the CarBack, it lights up, letting you know the battery status.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Trek CarBack Radar Features:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Daytime Running Light visible from up to 2km</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Radar for rear-approaching vehicle detection up to 240m</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ANT+ is compatible with all significant GPS head units</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Visible power gauge</li>\n\n\n\n<li>USB-C rechargeable</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Trek Accessory app allows compatibility with phone</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compact design better fits on more bikes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Simple, versatile mount works with aero seat posts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 100g with attachment piece</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MSRP: $200.00 </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trek CarBack First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-top--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-top--1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"Trek Carback installed top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-top--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-top--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-top--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-top--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-top--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If it’s safety-related, I’m in, especially if it’s for road riding. The roads are so dangerous that sometimes it’s tough just getting out. The addition of a radar to my daily riding has helped ease some of that anxiety. I was an early adopter of the radar game. I purchased one as soon as it came out and have been an advocate ever since. New units pop up every now and then, but they rarely stand up to the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/garmin-varia-rct715-camera-radar-unit/\">Garmin Varia </a>that I hold as the test bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Unboxing and Mounting</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-full-bacl--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-full-bacl--1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"Trek Carback installed full bacl\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-full-bacl--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-full-bacl--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-full-bacl--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-full-bacl--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-full-bacl--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trek CarBack is a compact rectangular unit, a departure from the long-range used by Bryton and Garmin. Its compact design and light weight make it easy to mount on many road and off-road bikes. I find that the heavy radar units move around on gravel and off-road rides, so a lighter unit is appreciated.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-weight--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1226\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-weight--1536x1226.jpeg\" alt=\"Trek Carback installed weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-weight--1536x1226.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-weight--297x237.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-weight--120x96.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-weight--768x613.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-weight--2048x1634.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The mount that comes with the unit is the “standard” Trek mount with a gummy strap. The strap is long enough to wrap around many different-shaped seat posts, are included. I like the gummy-style straps, but only when they work. The wire-style after-market ones from <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kom-cycling-garmin-varia-atop-mount/\">KOM Cycling </a>are my favorite. I’ve used them with my Garmin Varia for years with no issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pairing </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-mountain-side--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-mountain-side--1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"Trek Carback installed mountain side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-mountain-side--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-mountain-side--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-mountain-side--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-mountain-side--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-mountain-side--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The CarBack is flawless (or has been thus far). Pairing it with my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/gamin-edge-1040-solar-review/\">Garmin 1080 Solar</a> was easy. The unit’s functionality is as described, and it’s loud. I like the battery life indicator on the side of the unit. It’s nice to see when you’re off the bike for a quick break.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding detecting cars, I felt the CarBack was on par or quicker than the units I’ve used. The detection is accurate, and the same is true of the approaching speed of the cars. The battery life is solid, and I’ve yet to run the unit fully. Since the addition of the Trek Charger Station, I’ve vowed to charge my gear more often. The retail price of $200 is slightly less than the competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Final Impressions</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-mtb--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-mtb--1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"Trek Carback installed mtb\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-mtb--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-mtb--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-mtb--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-mtb--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trek-Carback-installed-mtb--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking at radars, there are many good options. The best one is the one you use and keep charged. The Trek CarBack has many features that I like, especially its size and weight. It’s an excellent option for someone who likes radar safety and wants to take the unit from bike to bike quickly. The ability to use the Trek Accessory App is an excellent addition to the unit’s usability. If you’re thinking about a radar, they are worth it: peace, peace, and safety. The Trek CarBack comes highly recommended and performs at the top tire with units like the Garmin Varira.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en\">Trekbikes.com</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/trek-enters-the-radar-game-with-carback-bike-radar/\">Trek Enters the Radar Game With CarBack Bike Radar</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d66fb130e4b060b39c8a42a8feac8230eb00fa8ec253ffa31aa4e380098a6dfd","category":"Cycling"}
