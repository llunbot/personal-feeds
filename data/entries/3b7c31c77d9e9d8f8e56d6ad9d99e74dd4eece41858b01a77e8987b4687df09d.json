It is said to be easier to build, and have a more nimble ride, making it quicker and more fun. Not to mention, Argo beefed up the frame with gussets and “fins”, making it stronger without sacrificing comfort. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Argo-Bikes-Cargo-Bike-Kit-2.0-outside-jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Argo-Bikes-Cargo-Bike-Kit-2.0-outside-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Argo Bikes Cargo Bike Kit 2.0 outside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Argo-Bikes-Cargo-Bike-Kit-2.0-outside-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Argo-Bikes-Cargo-Bike-Kit-2.0-outside-297x164.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Argo-Bikes-Cargo-Bike-Kit-2.0-outside-120x66.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Argo-Bikes-Cargo-Bike-Kit-2.0-outside-768x424.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will it Fit My Bike?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Argo Cargo Kit 2.0 is said to fit “10s of millions of bikes”.
