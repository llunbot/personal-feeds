Hot rods and custom cars have always been a SEMA thing, but these days there's no guarantee you'll find a brawny V8 or even any cylinders under the hood. In the past, we've covered show cars from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/these-electric-hot-rods-point-the-way-for-future-restomods/\">Ford</a> and Chevrolet, but this year the electric custom car is a full-blown trend.</p>\n<p>Of course, the big OEMs haven't ignored SEMA this year. Ford's still in the first flush of Mustang Mach-E mania, and the Blue Oval brought multiple Mach-Es to the show. One is an aggressive-looking Mach-E GT that'll be auctioned for charity after hopefully hitting 200 mph (321 km/h) at Bonneville, and another is bright orange with lowered air suspension and an e-bike charging rack at the back.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Shelby-Mustang-Mach-E-GT-Concept.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Shelby-Mustang-Mach-E-GT-Concept-980x621.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Shelby-Mustang-Mach-E-GT-Concept.jpg\">The Ford Mustang Mach-E GT was already not bad looking, but it looks positively great in Shelby concept form.</a> (credit: Ford)</p></div>\n<p>But the one that really caught my attention is a Shelby Mustang Mach-E GT concept, complete with the iconic white-with-blue-stripe livery.
