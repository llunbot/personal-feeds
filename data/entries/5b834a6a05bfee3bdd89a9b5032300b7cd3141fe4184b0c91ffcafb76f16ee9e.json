The <a href=\"https://us.nothing.tech/pages/phone-2\">Nothing Phone 2</a> is $599, and for the first time ever, it will be regularly sold in the US.</p>\n<p>For the SoC we have Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1. That makes this the first Nothing Phone with a flagship chip, though that is the 2H 2022 model, not the newer 8 Gen 2 chip. Then there's a 6.7-inch 120 Hz, 2412Ã—1080 OLED, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 4700 mAh battery with 45 W wired charging and 15 W wireless charging. The phone has an in-screen fingerprint reader. The worst part of the spec sheet is an IP54 rating for dust and water ingress, which means it can really only handle rain and isn't submergible. For its cameras, you have a 50 MP Sony IMX890 sensor as the main sensor and a 50 MP Samsung JN1 sensor as the wide-angle. The front camera is a 32 MP Sony IMX615.</p>\n<p>In the US, the phone has full band support for AT&amp;T and T-Mobile and what Nothing is calling \"limited support\" for Verizon. There's a full band list on the website, but it looks like there's no support for Verizon's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_(mobile_network)#Radio_frequency_summary\">primary 700 MHz LTE band</a>, band 13, and no mmWave. On the plus side, there's full support for Verizon's sub-6 GHz 5G bands. I'm not a Verizon customer to really know how big of a deal that is, and it would depend on your location anyway, but it's a little concerning there's no LTE.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952844#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952844&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5b834a6a05bfee3bdd89a9b5032300b7cd3141fe4184b0c91ffcafb76f16ee9e","category":"Tech"}
