He said the service will offer users a \"new way to invite people to parties, functions, and meetings.\" He did not say if this functionality would be available through a new standalone app, or built into an existing app, such as Calendar.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman said the new service is tied to iOS 18.3, which was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/apple-releases-ios-18-3/\">released to the public last week</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast month, <em>9to5Mac</em> discovered iOS 18.3 code references to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/09/apple-working-on-new-invites-app/\">potential new \"Invites\" app from Apple</a>, that would help users to organize meetings and other events. The report said the app would have iCloud integration. Gurman's information today seems to corroborate these findings, but there are still many unknown details.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's expected announcement should provide more clarity soon.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134\">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/02/new-icloud-invite-service-report/\">Apple May Launch New iCloud Feature Codenamed 'Confetti' This Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-may-launch-new-icloud-feature-codenamed-confetti-this-week.2448606/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2fd8f8acb0719fc98a6676204b079c94b30207f36d45c2f10d3b63eb88c6806b","category":"Apple"}
