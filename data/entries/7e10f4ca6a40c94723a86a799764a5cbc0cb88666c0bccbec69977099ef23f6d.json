If you’re asking yourself why you’re reading about such a thing on BikeRumor!, it’s because one of the show’s contestants is Lance Armstrong. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It goes without saying that the 51-year-old former professional cyclist who famously won seven consecutive Tour de France titles between 1998 and 2005 has led a checkered professional career. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And unfortunately for all the people he inspired through not only his cycling success but also his cancer survival, he fell hard. In 2012, a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/18655970\" target=\"_blank\">United States Anti-Doping Agency investigation</a> found that Armstrong was a part of “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/10/lance-armstrong-team-doping\" target=\"_blank\">the most sophisticated, professionalized, and successful doping program that [professional cycling] has ever seen</a>.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you’ll recall, all seven of Armstrong’s Tour de France titles and one Olympic medal were stripped. The Texan maintained his innocence until finally <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/lance-armstrong-confesses-doping/story?id=18244003\" target=\"_blank\">admitting to doping in 2013</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who harbor recreational interests other than cycling, Armstrong may or may not be the headlining celeb of <em>Stars on Mars. </em>The “former professional road-racing cyclist and investor,” as the show’s <a href=\"https://www.foxflash.com/releases/view/321lift-off-fox-launches-12-celebrities-to-the-red-planet-on-the-new-unscripted-series-stars-on-mars-debuting-monday-june-5-on-fox\" target=\"_blank\">press materials</a> refer to him, will join other retired icons like NFL running back Marshawn Lynch and UFC fighter Ronda Rousey on set. Natasha Leggero, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Adam Rippon, Tom Schwartz, Richard Sherman, Tinashe, Porsha Williams Guobadia, Tallulah Willis, and Ariel Winter round out the Fox show’s roster. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The contestants will “live, eat, sleep, strategize and bond with each other in the same [simulated] space station,” the press release reads. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to promotional materials, the show appears to be roughly based on a tried-and-true reality TV formula: the “crew” will live together in close confines while competing “missions” assigned to them by fictional starship captain and surprisingly decent singer/songwriter (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSC2HmCGVns\" target=\"_blank\">when he collabs with Ben Folds</a>) William Shatner. The contestants will vote one crew member “back to Earth,” each week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The voting component necessitates “stellar social skills,” which could spell trouble for Armstrong — a man with a long track record of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/sports/endurance/story/_/id/8860572/former-employee-says-lance-armstrong-made-life-very-very-unpleasant\" target=\"_blank\">allegedly bullying and humiliating teammates and employees</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If he runs foul, he’d better steer clear of Rousey. On the other hand, maybe the skills Armstrong cultivated in his years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/18/lance-armstrong-doping-denials-quotes\" target=\"_blank\">lying about doping</a> are exactly what you need to win a reality TV show contest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.fox.com/stars-on-mars/\" target=\"_blank\">fox.com/stars-on-mars</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lance-armstrong-to-go-to-fake-space-with-william-shatner/\">Lance Armstrong to go to Fake Space with William Shatner</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Andrew Marshall","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"7e10f4ca6a40c94723a86a799764a5cbc0cb88666c0bccbec69977099ef23f6d","category":"Cycling"}
