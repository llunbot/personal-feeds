Although the new tyre wasn’t able to avoid the tidal wave of punctures synonymous with Paris-Roubaix, we suspect Specialized was happy with its performance in the women’s race, with Lotte Kopecky bagging a top-10 finish.</p>\n<p><em>MBUK</em> video presenter Will Soffe’s first long-term test bike report went live this week.
