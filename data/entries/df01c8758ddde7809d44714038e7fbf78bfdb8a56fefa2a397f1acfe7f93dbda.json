Instead, the automaker introduced a proprietary infotainment platform, aiming to control and customize the digital experience within its vehicles. This transition is part of GM's strategic pivot toward enhancing its software capabilities and establishing a stronger digital services revenue stream. However, the change has not been without its hurdles, with numerous customers and automotive reviewers reporting technical issues and a steep learning curve associated with the new system.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌CarPlay‌ has become a staple of most new vehicles, offering drivers a familiar interface that mirrors their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s functionality onto the vehicle's dashboard. Apple reported in 2022 that 79% of car buyers in the U.S. insisted on ‌CarPlay‌ support when considering a new vehicle purchase. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGM's new in-house system, Ultifi, is envisioned as a comprehensive digital platform that offers a range of services such as navigation and media streaming, enhanced by subscription-based add-ons to drive revenue. Despite these aspirations, the rollout of Ultifi has encountered significant obstacles such as software malfunctions that dealerships have struggled to resolve. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGM's move is driven by a wish to reclaim customer connections and data insights from third parties, but customer resistance to abandoning a familiar and popular system like ‌CarPlay‌ that directly integrates with their ‌iPhone‌ poses a significant challenge to GM's strategy.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe outcome of GM's decision could influence future industry practices significantly. If GM can refine Ultifi into a robust, user-friendly platform that rivals or surpasses ‌CarPlay‌'s functionality, it may set a precedent for other automakers to follow suit. Conversely, if consumers continue to prefer established systems like ‌CarPlay‌, automakers may find themselves in a difficult position, needing to balance their corporate interests with consumer preferences.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSee <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-05-01/will-gm-regret-kicking-apple-carplay-off-the-dashboard\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s full article</a> for more insights into GM's move to abandon Apple ‌CarPlay‌.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gm/\">GM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/general-motors/\">General Motors</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/gm-controversial-move-to-abandon-carplay/\">Report Examines GM's Controversial Move to Abandon Apple CarPlay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-examines-gms-controversial-move-to-abandon-apple-carplay.2425248/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"df01c8758ddde7809d44714038e7fbf78bfdb8a56fefa2a397f1acfe7f93dbda","category":"Apple"}
