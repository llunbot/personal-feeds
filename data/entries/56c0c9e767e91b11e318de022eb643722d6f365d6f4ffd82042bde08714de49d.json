The 2023 edition begins on Sunday 23rd July in Clermont-Ferrand, and will see the peloton cover 956 kilometers over 8 Stages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of the action, Out in Front takes a timely look back at the history of women’s cycling. Former Tour de France riders, Denise Kelly, Marilyn Trout and Maria Canins (two-time winner of the Tour de France) make special guest appearances in what is a very emotional, but equally inspiring reflection of how far women’s professional cycling has come, and how far is still to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/womens-tour-de-france-riders-of-1980s-events.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/womens-tour-de-france-riders-of-1980s-events-800x534.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/womens-tour-de-france-riders-of-1980s-events-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/womens-tour-de-france-riders-of-1980s-events-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/womens-tour-de-france-riders-of-1980s-events-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/womens-tour-de-france-riders-of-1980s-events-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/womens-tour-de-france-riders-of-1980s-events-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/womens-tour-de-france-riders-of-1980s-events-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/womens-tour-de-france-riders-of-1980s-events.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>Marilyn Trout (left) and Denise Kelly (right) rode in the ’84 and ’87, and ’87 and ’89 editions of the Tour de France Feminines</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A total of €250,000 will be awarded across the different stage, jersey and team competitions, including €50,000 to the winner of the final general classification. That compares to the €500,000 that will be claimed by the winner of the men’s Tour de France in just two days’ time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From Canyon:</strong> In the creation of this film, as well as in sponsoring female teams, ambassadors, and a host of initiatives to inspire women to jump on the saddle, we are explicitly committing to long-term investment in women’s cycling. This way, the ongoing efforts of female athletes both on and off the bike, are acknowledged, promoted, and celebrated, showing the younger generation of women that there’s a place for them in cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tour-de-france-femmes-out-in-front-canyon-sram-how-to-watch.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tour-de-france-femmes-out-in-front-canyon-sram-how-to-watch-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"tour de france femmes out in front canyon sram how to watch 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tour-de-france-femmes-out-in-front-canyon-sram-how-to-watch-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tour-de-france-femmes-out-in-front-canyon-sram-how-to-watch-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tour-de-france-femmes-out-in-front-canyon-sram-how-to-watch-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tour-de-france-femmes-out-in-front-canyon-sram-how-to-watch-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tour-de-france-femmes-out-in-front-canyon-sram-how-to-watch-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tour-de-france-femmes-out-in-front-canyon-sram-how-to-watch-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tour-de-france-femmes-out-in-front-canyon-sram-how-to-watch.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to watch the 2023 Tour de Frances Femmes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Europe and the UK, the 2023 Tour de France Femmes will be live streaming on Eurosport.
