Their latest proposal calls for\nraises of as much as 10%, as well as major changes to the outlet’s\nvacation policy, bereavement leave and overtime. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The workers’ negotiators also want Apple to adopt a tipping\nsystem, letting patrons offer gratuities in increments of 3%, 5%\nor a custom amount for in-store credit-card transactions.</p>\n\n<p>“This will allow thankful patrons the ability to express gratitude\nfor a job well done without any obligations,” the union wrote\nApple. “All monies collected through this manner would be\ndispersed to members of the bargaining unit biweekly based on any\nhours worked.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Higher pay and better vacation/holiday/leave policies are exactly the sort of things the union should ask for.</p>\n\n<p>But this tipping proposal is so antithetical to Apple’s customer-first retail experience that it feels like a joke, or that the union negotiators have never even been in an Apple Store. They might as well ask for employees to be allowed to vape while working. Asking for something like tipping — on very expensive products, no less — plays right into the hands of those who argue that retail store unionization is not aligned with the interests of customers.</p>\n\n<p>Stores that pay employees by commission create an obvious incentive for salespeople to pressure customers into purchasing items they don’t need or aren’t entirely comfortable with. Prompting for tips on retail sales is just a backdoor commission.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/04/apple-store-maryland-union-tips\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6aafc0008bc14c098bbc9bf5a74702c05a27c116cfcc0b3a3e4dc639aa352b17","category":"Tech"}
