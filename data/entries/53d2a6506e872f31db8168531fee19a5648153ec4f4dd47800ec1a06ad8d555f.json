They say that other sealants that are used in either road or gravel tires dry out quickly, therefore milKit has developed a sealant specifically designed for “high-pressure biking”. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-dipping.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-dipping-800x1200.jpeg\" alt=\"milKit Road:gravel Sealant dipping\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-dipping-800x1200.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-dipping-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-dipping-80x120.jpeg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-dipping-768x1152.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-dipping.jpeg 853w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-using-syringe.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-using-syringe-800x1000.jpeg\" alt=\"milKit Road:gravel Sealant using syringe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-using-syringe-800x1000.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-using-syringe-240x300.jpeg 240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-using-syringe-96x120.jpeg 96w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-using-syringe-768x960.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-using-syringe.jpeg 1024w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-using-the-valve.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-using-the-valve-800x1000.jpeg\" alt=\"milKit Road:gravel Sealant using the valve\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-using-the-valve-800x1000.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-using-the-valve-240x300.jpeg 240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-using-the-valve-96x120.jpeg 96w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-using-the-valve-768x960.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-using-the-valve.jpeg 1024w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This was done by creating a new formula with “more liquid consistency that endures longer-lasting functionality within the tires”. In addition to the higher liquidity of the new sealant, it also uses a new particle composition so it’s able to easily seal punctures in tires with high pressure while keeping the homogeneity benefits throughout. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-all-the-sizes-e1688143778998.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-all-the-sizes-e1688143778998-800x429.jpeg\" alt=\"milKit Road:gravel Sealant all the sizes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-all-the-sizes-e1688143778998-800x429.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-all-the-sizes-e1688143778998-297x159.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-all-the-sizes-e1688143778998-120x64.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-all-the-sizes-e1688143778998-768x412.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Roadgravel-Sealant-all-the-sizes-e1688143778998.jpeg 861w\" /></a><figcaption>(L to R) 1000ml, 500ml, 250ml, 75ml.</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Road-and-gravel-Sealant-i5-liter-jug-e1688142462173.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"681\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Road-and-gravel-Sealant-i5-liter-jug-e1688142462173-800x681.jpeg\" alt=\"milKit Road and gravel Sealant 5 liter jug\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Road-and-gravel-Sealant-i5-liter-jug-e1688142462173-800x681.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Road-and-gravel-Sealant-i5-liter-jug-e1688142462173-297x253.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Road-and-gravel-Sealant-i5-liter-jug-e1688142462173-120x102.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Road-and-gravel-Sealant-i5-liter-jug-e1688142462173-768x654.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-Road-and-gravel-Sealant-i5-liter-jug-e1688142462173.jpeg 1142w\" /></a><figcaption>5-Liter Jug</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the milKit Road and Gravel Sealant are available in all sizes, catering to different preferences. There’s the 75ml for those “on-the-go fixes, or choose the 250ml, 500ml, or 1000ml versions for regular use. If you’re a shop professional or just swap out tires a lot, go for the big 5-liter jug. All of the sealant quantities (except the 5-liter jug) are packaged in 100% recycled PET bottles. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Advantages of milKit’s Road and Gravel Sealant</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increased durability in tires</strong><br /><em>An optimized mixing ratio ensures better distribution of sealant within the tire, resulting in improved longevity and maximum performance capability</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enhanced sealing function under high pressure</strong><br /><em>Thanks to a new particle formula, even under extremely high pressures, punctures are reliably sealed</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Homogenous and sustainable</strong><br />The benefits of homogeneity are maintained when the sealant is shaken before use. Additionally, it has a minimum shelf life of 5 years in the bottle and is free from toxic ingredients. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Common Sealant vs milKit Tubeless Sealant</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-USPs-Road-Gravel-Dichtmilch-EN.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"736\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-USPs-Road-Gravel-Dichtmilch-EN.jpg\" alt=\"milKit Road Gravel compare\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-USPs-Road-Gravel-Dichtmilch-EN.jpg 736w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-USPs-Road-Gravel-Dichtmilch-EN-297x133.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/milKit-USPs-Road-Gravel-Dichtmilch-EN-120x54.jpg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>milKit Road and Gravel Sealant Retail</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>75ml: 9.95 € ($10.86)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>250ml: 20.95 € ($22.86)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>500ml: 28.95 € ($31.59)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1000ml: 41.95 € ($45.77)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5-Liters: 166.95 € ($182.17) </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, the new Road and Gravel Sealant has been added to milKit’s current line of sealants, giving the entire line more diversity to fit the needs of all cyclists. milKit is also developing a specialized sealant that is specifically designed for eBikes…stay tuned to Bikerumor for updates on this.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://milkit.bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Milkit.Bike</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/milkit-road-gravel-bike-tire-sealant/\">milKit Introduces New Road &amp; Gravel Specific Tire Sealant</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"53d2a6506e872f31db8168531fee19a5648153ec4f4dd47800ec1a06ad8d555f","category":"Cycling"}
