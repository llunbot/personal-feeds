Then I realized that Syniverse’s “customers” are entire carriers, not individual people. So, yeah, this is bad.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Syniverse repeatedly declined to answer specific questions from\nMotherboard about the scale of the breach and what specific data\nwas affected, but according to a person who works at a telephone\ncarrier, whoever hacked Syniverse could have had access to\nmetadata such as length and cost, caller and receiver’s numbers,\nthe location of the parties in the call, as well as the content of\nSMS text messages. […]</p>\n\n<p>The company wrote that it discovered the breach in May 2021, but\nthat the hack began in May of 2016.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not what you want.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/04/syniverse-hack\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ae420ac78df6099aa3fc204f20c1e93aa492de0870aea273a5223683716cbae6","category":"Tech"}
