In its entirety:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You already <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/18/opinion/trump-presidency-record.html\">know</a> Donald Trump. He is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/11/opinion/editorials/donald-trump-2024-unfit.html\">unfit</a> to lead. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/opinion/donald-trump-ezra-klein-podcast.html\">Watch him</a>. Listen to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/26/opinion/donald-trump-personality-history.html\">those</a> who know him <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/18/opinion/trump-cabinet-election-2024.html\">best</a>. He tried to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/opinion/trump-jan-6-indictment.html\">subvert</a> an election and remains a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/06/opinion/trump-2024-campaign-warning.html\">threat</a> to democracy. He helped overturn Roe, with terrible <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/17/opinion/dobbs-roe-abortion-stories.html\">consequences</a>. Mr. Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/opinion/trump-presidency-corruption.html\">corruption</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/17/opinion/trump-five-major-investigations-dozens-of-ways-out.html\">lawlessness</a> go <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/opinion/donald-trump-trial.html\">beyond</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/15/opinion/editorials/trump-indictment-republicans.html\">elections</a>: It’s his whole <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/opinion/trump-al-capone.html\">ethos</a>. He <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/opinion/trump-lies-charts-data.html\">lies</a> without <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/25/opinion/what-trump-says.html\">limit</a>. If he’s re-elected, the G.O.P. won’t <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/opinion/trump-2024-election.html\">restrain</a> him. Mr. Trump will use the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/opinion/donald-trump-culture-decline.html\">government</a> to go after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/08/opinion/trump-2025-second-term.html?\">opponents</a>. He will pursue a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/opinion/trump-debate-haitians-pets.html\">cruel</a> policy of mass <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/opinion/trump-woodward-milley-mass-deportation.html\">deportations</a>. He will wreak havoc on the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/opinion/harris-trump-debate-issues.html\">poor</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/opinion/trump-threat-treasury-market.html\">middle class</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/23/opinion/ceo-trump-republican-support.html\">employers</a>. Another Trump term will damage the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/opinion/trump-biden-climate-election.html\">climate</a>, shatter <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/opinion/trump-harris-foreign-policy.html\">alliances</a> and strengthen <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/opinion/trump-foreign-policy.html\">autocrats</a>. Americans should demand <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/opinion/editorials/kamala-harris-2024-endorsement.html\">better</a>.
