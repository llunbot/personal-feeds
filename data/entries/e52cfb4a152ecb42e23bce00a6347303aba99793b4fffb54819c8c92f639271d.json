It's the fifth feature film in the rebooted franchise, which also includes the animated series <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_Island_(TV_series)\">Skull Island</a> </em>and Apple TV+'s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch:_Legacy_of_Monsters\"><em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> below.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/12/two-titans-team-up-to-defeat-a-new-foe-in-godzilla-x-kong-the-new-empire-trailer/\">previously reported</a>, <em>Godzilla x Kong</em> picks up sometime after its 2021 predecessor. <em>Godzilla vs. Kong </em>showcased not only a major showdown between its titular titans—in which Godzilla emerged the victor—but also the two teaming up in the climactic finale to take out Mechagodzilla, a telepathically controlled creature with the severed head of Ghidorah.

(Kong got the final honors, although Godzilla charged the killing ax—made from one of his dorsal plates—with his atomic breath.) </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003458#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003458&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e52cfb4a152ecb42e23bce00a6347303aba99793b4fffb54819c8c92f639271d","category":"Tech"}
