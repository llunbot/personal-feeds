And that's why some products try to offer both.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938066#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938066&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1136406f8420174337430ce0385612baf2bf31481d4b3b2720e63828e4aeb96c","category":"Tech"}
