Silent community spread appeared to be behind the unconnected cases. Overall, drug-resistant fungal skin infection cases (aka ringworm) have been identified in at least 11 US states to date.</p>\n<p>With resistance on the rise, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took a closer look at how US clinicians prescribe topical antifungals. As is the case of antibiotics and bacterial infections, overuse of antifungals can drive the development of resistance. And properly diagnosing skin infections can be extremely difficult without diagnostics. A 2016 survey study found that even board-certified dermatologists were <a href=\"https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(16)30883-0/fulltext\">frequently wrong when trying to identify skin infections just by sight</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996151#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996151&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"04092905db878be3abe44390fcc9c71f623497d16907c05dd77b173b0dd25cc6","category":"Tech"}
