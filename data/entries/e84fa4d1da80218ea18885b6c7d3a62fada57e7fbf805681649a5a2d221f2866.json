{"title":"‘MLB for VisionOS Strikes Out on Opening Day’","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/03/mlb-for-visionos-strikes-out-on-opening-day/","date":1711673257000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/28/snell-mls-highlights\">More</a> sports-on-Vision-Pro news from Jason Snell:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That might still happen, but just before Opening Day the app was \nupdated to support real, live baseball games, and all the exciting \nstuff is gone. Today I took it for a spin and was deeply \ndisappointed — it’s essentially just a front end for watching \ngames via MLB TV, and a buggy one at that. </p>\n\n<p>I couldn’t find support for Gameday when I first used the app, \nthough later when playing back an archived stream, I did find \nGameday available — from within the video playback, so you can’t \nuse it for a game you’re not watching on the app. And it’s \nimmersive, so you can’t put it up and then do something else, \nwhich is also probably a mistake. </p>\n\n<p>The app also only plays back a single video at a time, even if \nmultiple games are going on at once — despite the fact that \nwatching multiple video streams at once is basically what VR was \nmade for. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I watched the end of the <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-gets-first-hit-rbi-with-yankees-on-opening-day\">Yankees opener against the Houston Asterisks</a> wearing Vision Pro, and share all of Snell’s gripes about the app. It’s downright bizarre that the app has a “main” window that, if closed, quits the entire app — but that’s not the window where you watch video!</p>\n\n<p>And so many little paper cuts, like the fact that the app doesn’t integrate with the system Keychain APIs, so you don’t get autofill for passwords. I’m so used to password autofill across all my devices that it felt like I was using some sort of retro device, entering my MLB.com password manually.</p>\n\n<p>Glad to see MLB have a native app on Opening Day, but man, they have a long way to go before it’s actually good.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/28/mlb-vision-app-strikes-out\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e84fa4d1da80218ea18885b6c7d3a62fada57e7fbf805681649a5a2d221f2866","category":"Tech"}
