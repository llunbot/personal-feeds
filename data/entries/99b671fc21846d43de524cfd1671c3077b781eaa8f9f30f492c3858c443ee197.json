It also costs $329 instead of $269, the current MSRP (and current street price) for the regular RX 7600.</p>\n<p>It's a card with a pretty narrow target audience: people who are worried about buying a GPU with 8GB of memory, but who <em>aren't</em> worried enough about future-proofing or RAM requirements to buy a more powerful GPU. It's priced reasonably well, at least—$60 is a lot to pay for extra memory, but $329 was the MSRP for the Radeon RX 6600 back in 2021. If you want more memory in a current-generation card, you otherwise generally need to jump up into the $450 range (for the 12GB RX 7700 XT or the 16GB RTX 4060 Ti) or beyond.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>RX 7700 XT</th>\n<th>RX 7600</th>\n<th>RX 7600 XT</th>\n<th>RX 6600</th>\n<th>RX 6600 XT</th>\n<th>RX 6650 XT</th>\n<th>RX 6750 XT</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Compute units (Stream processors)</th>\n<td>54 (3,456)</td>\n<td>32 (2,048)</td>\n<td>32 (2,048)</td>\n<td>28 (1,792)</td>\n<td>32 (2,048)</td>\n<td>32 (2,048)</td>\n<td>40 (2,560)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Boost Clock</th>\n<td>2,544 MHz</td>\n<td>2,600 MHz</td>\n<td>2,760 MHz</td>\n<td>2,490 MHz</td>\n<td>2,589 MHz</td>\n<td>2,635 MHz</td>\n<td>2,600 MHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Memory Bus Width</th>\n<td>192-bit</td>\n<td>128-bit</td>\n<td>128-bit</td>\n<td>128-bit</td>\n<td>128-bit</td>\n<td>128-bit</td>\n<td>192-bit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Memory Clock</th>\n<td>2,250 MHz</td>\n<td>2,250 MHz</td>\n<td>2,250 MHz</td>\n<td>1,750 MHz</td>\n<td>2,000 MHz</td>\n<td>2,190 MHz</td>\n<td>2,250 MHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Memory size</th>\n<td>12GB GDDR6</td>\n<td>8GB GDDR6</td>\n<td>16GB GDDR6</td>\n<td>8GB GDDR6</td>\n<td>8GB GDDR6</td>\n<td>8GB GDDR6</td>\n<td>12GB GDDR6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Total board power (TBP)</th>\n<td>245 W</td>\n<td>165 W</td>\n<td>190 W</td>\n<td>132 W</td>\n<td>160 W</td>\n<td>180 W</td>\n<td>250 W</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The fact of the matter is that this is the same silicon we've already seen. The clock speed bumps do provide a small across-the-board performance uplift, and the impact of the extra RAM does become apparent in a few of our tests. But the card doesn't fundamentally alter the AMD-vs-Nvidia-vs-Intel dynamic in the $300-ish graphics card market, though it addresses a couple of the regular RX 7600's most glaring weaknesses.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997822#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997822&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"99b671fc21846d43de524cfd1671c3077b781eaa8f9f30f492c3858c443ee197","category":"Tech"}
