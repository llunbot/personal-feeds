There’s an early fourth-category climb and a few lumpy bits throughout the stage, but it’s hard to see this finishing in anything but a bunch sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The approach to the finish in Libourne is very straightforward but the last kilometre is very slightly uphill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to watch for:</strong> Can Mark Cavendish set a new record for Tour de France stage wins in a career?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for:</strong> The sprinters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dane Cash’s picks: </strong><em>There aren’t a whole lot of sprinters left in this field to challenge Cavendish and the dominant Deceuninck-QuickStep lead-out train, so he’s the clear favorite for stage 19. Jasper Philipsen and perhaps Wout van Aert are others to watch, and with so many pure speedsters gone, Sonny Colbrelli and Michael Matthews will likely be in the mix as well.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TDF21_PROFILS-ETAPES-SANS-RAVITO_ETP19.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/TDF21_ET19_carte-1340x1895.jpeg\" /></figure>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/preview-what-you-need-to-know-about-stage-19-of-the-2021-tour-de-france/\">Read More</a>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"d0e6a8b6af58b184d2039ebdb2cf9f922eafe975bcbfeceec8083cee68f8aef2","category":"Cycling"}
