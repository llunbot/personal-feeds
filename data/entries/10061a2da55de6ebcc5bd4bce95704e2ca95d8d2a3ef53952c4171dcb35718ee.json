At $70 for a limited time, the device is an affordable ‌HomeKit‌ thermostat option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/meross-matter-thermostat.jpg\" width=\"999\" height=\"561\" />\r<br />\nThe Smart Thermostat features a minimalist design with a white glass panel that has LEDs that show the temperature and other settings. It requires a C wire for power, and Meross says that it should work with 95 percent of heating and cooling systems in North America, including single and multi-stage furnaces, boilers, air conditioners, heat pumps, and fan coil units.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBecause the thermostat integrates with ‌HomeKit‌, temperature can be controlled through <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> voice commands, in the Apple Home app, or in the Meross app. There are also touch controls on the device itself.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHeating and cooling usage are tracked in the Meross app, and there is an option to save energy costs with a smart schedule that changes the temperature when people are away from home. It can also be used in automations with other ‌HomeKit‌ products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBecause the thermostat is Matter-enabled, it can also be controlled by Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings provided an appropriate Matter hub is available. Matter devices are able to be controlled by multiple ecosystems, which is useful in households where not everyone has an Apple device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeross plans to charge $99.99 for the Smart Thermostat, but <a href=\"https://shop.meross.com/products/matter-smart-thermostat-mts300ma?ref=HZfLkN8e1BqP\">it is currently available</a> at a discounted $70 price.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/matter/\">Matter</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/05/meross-matter-thermostat/\">Meross Debuts $70 Matter-Enabled Smart Thermostat</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meross-debuts-70-matter-enabled-smart-thermostat.2444728/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"10061a2da55de6ebcc5bd4bce95704e2ca95d8d2a3ef53952c4171dcb35718ee","category":"Apple"}
