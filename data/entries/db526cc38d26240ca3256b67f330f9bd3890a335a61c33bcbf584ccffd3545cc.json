Now, Japanese scientists at the University of Tsukuba have figured out how to transform cicadas into cyborg insects capable of \"playing\" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachelbel's_Canon\">Pachelbel's Canon</a>. They described their work in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16459\">a preprint</a> published on the physics arXiv.

The idea was to use them as hybrid robots for search-and-rescue applications.</p>\n<p>For instance, in 2015, Texas A&amp;M scientists <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2014.1363\">found that</a> implanting electrodes into a cockroach's ganglion (the neuron cluster that controls its front legs) was remarkably effective at successfully steering the roaches 60 percent of the time. They outfitted the roaches with tiny backpacks synced with a remote controller and administered shocks to disrupt the insect's balance, forcing it to move in the desired direction</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/cyborg-cicadas-play-pachelbels-canon/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/cyborg-cicadas-play-pachelbels-canon/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"db526cc38d26240ca3256b67f330f9bd3890a335a61c33bcbf584ccffd3545cc","category":"Tech"}
