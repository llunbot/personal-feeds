The back of the pass includes the individual's Healthcare Identifier, what vaccine was received, and the date of both doses.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Australian digital certificate is official proof of COVID-19 vaccination should it become needed domestically or for travel, and is separate from any other immunizations the individual may have received. The certificate is similar to digital passes generated by some other government apps, such as the UK's NHS COVID pass scheme.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/australia/\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/covid-19-coronavirus/\">COVID-19 Coronavirus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/02/australian-covid-vaccine-cert-apple-wallet/\">Australian Government Now Offering COVID-19 Digital Vaccination Certificates for Apple Wallet</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=k6VOpFgH4R0:AcO0Cf_9fu4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=k6VOpFgH4R0:AcO0Cf_9fu4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/k6VOpFgH4R0\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"98bb4035069cae77bca5f226f4c210a6d222a6198a945227ad1a66bd006a142d","category":"Apple"}
