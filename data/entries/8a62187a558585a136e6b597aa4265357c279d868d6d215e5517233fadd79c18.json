However, this was more difficult to achieve for applications that are hosted on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/?trk=02e98c17-b119-4e37-a7fe-8ec970b57c57&amp;sc_channel=ps&amp;ef_id=Cj0KCQiA6Ou5BhCrARIsAPoTxrDEqJQHWADLYlT3eT2MsnjFzgt12Hz8mtn9R4lIXy2jUb9Ue4yG8T0aAr3SEALw_wcB:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!638305116390!e!!g!!aws%20ec2%20website%20hosting!19095758113!147590865561&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA6Ou5BhCrARIsAPoTxrDEqJQHWADLYlT3eT2MsnjFzgt12Hz8mtn9R4lIXy2jUb9Ue4yG8T0aAr3SEALw_wcB\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</a> or using load balancers, because you had to create your own solution to achieve the same result. You would have to use a combination of methods such as using <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html\">access control lists (ACLs)</a>, managing firewall rules, or using logic such as header validation and a few other techniques to ensure that the endpoint remained exclusive to CloudFront.</p> \n<p>CloudFront VPC origins removes the need for this kind of undifferentiated work by offering a managed solution that can be used to point CloudFront distributions directly to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html\">Application Load Balancers (ALBs)</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html\">Network Load Balancers (NLBs)</a>, or EC2 instances inside your private subnets. This ensures that CloudFront becomes the sole ingress point for those resources with minimum configuration effort, providing you with improved performance and a cost-saving opportunity because it also eliminates the need for public IP addresses.</p> \n<p><strong>Configuring a CloudFront VPC origin<br /> </strong>CloudFront VPC origins is available at no additional cost, making it an accessible option for all AWS customers. It can be integrated with new or existing CloudFront distributions using the Amazon CloudFront console or the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)</a>.</p> \n<p>Imagine that you have an application hosted privately on an <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html\">AWS Fargate for Amazon ECS</a> fronted through an ALB. Let’s create a CloudFront distribution that uses the ALB directly inside the private subnet.</p> \n<p>Start by navigating to the CloudFront console and select the new menu option: <strong>VPC origins</strong>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/14/vpc-orgin-page.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/14/vpc-orgin-page.png\" alt=\"vpc origins page\" width=\"1075\" height=\"461\" /></a></p> \n<p>Creating a new VPC origin is straightforward. You only need to select from a few options. In the <strong>Origin ARN, </strong>you can search for available resources that are hosted in private subnets or enter it directly. You select the resources that you want, choose a friendly name for your VPC origin alongside some security options, and then confirm. Please note that, at launch, the VPC origin resource must be in the same AWS Account as the CloudFront distribution, although support for resources across all accounts is coming soon.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/20/marked-create-vpc-origin-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/20/marked-create-vpc-origin-1.png\" alt=\"creating a vpc origin\" width=\"1477\" height=\"819\" /></a></p> \n<p>After the creation process is complete, your VPC origin will be deployed and ready to go! You can check its status on the <strong>VPC origins</strong> page.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/20/marked-vpc-origin-deployed.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/20/marked-vpc-origin-deployed.png\" width=\"1514\" height=\"220\" /></a></p> \n<p>With this, we have created a CloudFront distribution that serves content directly from a resource hosted on a private subnet in a few clicks! After your VPC origin is created, you can navigate to your Distribution window, and add the VPC origin to your Distribution by either selecting the ARN from the dropdown or copy-pasting the ARN manually.</p> \n<p>Remember, though, that it’s important to still continue to layer your application’s security by using services such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/waf/\">AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)</a> to protect from web exploits, or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/shield/\">AWS Shield</a> for managed DDos protection, and other services to achieve a full-spectrum protection.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Conclusion</strong></span><br /> CloudFront VPC Origins offers a new way for organizations to deliver secure, high-performance applications by enabling CloudFront distributions to serve content directly from resources hosted within private subnets. This reduces the complexity and cost of maintaining public-facing origins while ensuring that your application remains secure.</p> \n<p>To learn more, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-origin.html\">getting started guide</a>.</p> \n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/codingmatheus/\">Matheus Guimaraes | @codingmatheus</a>","author":"Matheus Guimaraes","siteTitle":"AWS News Blog","siteHash":"6093e072e4117ec22616e844cb857d03ca62c57a411a8affc77cb5e8b6b15bf6","entryHash":"8a62187a558585a136e6b597aa4265357c279d868d6d215e5517233fadd79c18","category":"Tech"}
