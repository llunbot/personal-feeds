Gabbard said she was not made aware of the U.K. order prior to it being reported in the media.\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"Upon initial review of the U.S. and U.K. bilateral CLOUD Act Agreement, the United Kingdom may not issue demands for data of U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents, nor is it authorized to demand the data of persons located inside the United States,\" Gabbard wrote.</blockquote>The CLOUD Act (Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act) was designed to regulate how governments can request data across borders while protecting citizens' privacy rights.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple introduced end-to-end encryption for iCloud backups in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/apple-advanced-data-protection/\">2022</a>, meaning only users have the keys to access their data. The company has historically opposed creating encryption backdoors, arguing they inevitably compromise security for all users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple CEO Tim Cook has consistently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/12/21/60-minutes-inside-apple-special/\">insisted</a> that providing backdoor access past its encryption for authorities would open the door for \"bad guys\" to gain access to its users' data. Cybersecurity experts agree that any government backdoor would eventually be discovered and exploited by malicious actors. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-advanced-data-protection-icloud/\">How to Enable Advanced Data Protection</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nU.S. agencies including the FBI and CISA, the U.S. cyber defense agency, recently advocated for increased use of encryption to protect against cyber threats from the likes of China. In December, the agencies jointly advised Americans to \"ensure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible\" as a countermeasure against foreign cyber campaigns.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/\">Apple Privacy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-security/\">Apple Security</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/\">Encryption</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/us-probes-uk-apple-backdoor-treaty-violation/\">US Probes UK's Apple Encryption Demand for Possible Treaty Violation</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/us-probes-uks-apple-encryption-demand-for-possible-treaty-violation.2450280/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"51f3f8e3dade498dbf13c2021cd561094000b04fc88a585977d4e86498e4c5a6","category":"Apple"}
