This isn't the first time the leaker has used the name \"Desert Titanium\" in reference to the new color, which has variously been described as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/16/iphone-16-pro-colors-revealed/\">rose or rose-gold</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/new-iphone-16-pro-color-bronze-appearance/\">bronze-like</a>. Back in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-16-pro-two-new-color-options/\">February</a>, Bu said that the \"Desert Titanium\" will be similar to the Gold color option offered on the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, but \"deeper and heavier.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/camera-lens-rings-iphone16-pro.jpeg\" alt=\"lens rings\" width=\"1289\" height=\"728\" /><div><em>Alleged camera lens rings for iPhone 16 Pro models</em></div>\r<br />\nThe iPhone 16 Pro will introduce \"Desert Titanium\" as a new color option, replacing the iPhone 15 Pro's \"Blue Titanium\". It will be available alongside <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/16/iphone-16-pro-colors-revealed/\">White, Black, and Natural Titanium</a>. This year's Black Titanium is expected to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/01/iphone-16-pro-colors-shown-leaked-image/\">darker</a>, while Natural Titanium will have a more pronounced gray finish.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/iphone-16-pro-new-polished-titanium-finish/\">rumor</a> suggests that Apple is using an improved process for finishing and coloring titanium, which will result in a glossier look than the brushed aluminum finish of the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models. The glossy finish could look much more like the stainless steel that Apple used in prior years, but it will be more resistant to scratches.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/iphone-16-launch-everything-we-know/\">iPhone 16 Launch Is Less Than One Month Out – Here's Everything We Know</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThe iPhone 16 series launch is less than a month away, with Apple's release schedule for its latest lineup typically occuring around mid-September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/\">Majin Bu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/iphone-16-pro-color-desert-titanium/\">Bronze-Like iPhone 16 Pro Color Could Be Called 'Desert Titanium'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bronze-like-iphone-16-pro-color-could-be-called-desert-titanium.2433900/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"db4be9f80efb14b717b65613103595bc4f8788a1a5d99f842cb875e1ab151fe3","category":"Apple"}
