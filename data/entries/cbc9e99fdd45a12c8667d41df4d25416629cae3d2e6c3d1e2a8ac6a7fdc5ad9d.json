The shift marks a dramatic change for the AI company behind <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/\">ChatGPT</a>, potentially making it more attractive to investors while raising questions about its commitment to sharing the benefits of advanced AI with \"all of humanity,\" as written in its <a href=\"https://openai.com/charter/\">charter</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A for-profit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation\">benefit corporation</a> is a legal structure that allows companies to pursue both financial profits and social or environmental goals, ostensibly balancing shareholder interests with a broader mission to benefit society. It's an approach taken by some of OpenAI's competitors, such as Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI.</p>\n<p>In a notable change under the new plan, CEO Sam Altman would receive equity in the for-profit company for the first time. Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-25/openai-cto-mira-murati-says-she-will-leave-the-company\">reports</a> that OpenAI is discussing giving Altman a 7 percent stake, though the exact details are still under negotiation. This represents a departure from Altman's previous stance of not taking equity in the company, which he had maintained was in line with OpenAI's mission to benefit humanity rather than individuals.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052614#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052614&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cbc9e99fdd45a12c8667d41df4d25416629cae3d2e6c3d1e2a8ac6a7fdc5ad9d","category":"Tech"}
