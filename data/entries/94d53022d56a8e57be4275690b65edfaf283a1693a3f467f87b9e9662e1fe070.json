Since then, it has gotten a raft of updates, including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/the-latest-app-to-get-a-windows-11-redesign-the-humble-notepad/\">a visual redesign</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/windows-notepads-midlife-renaissance-continues-with-spellcheck-and-autocorrect/\">spellcheck and autocorrect</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/02/major-windows-11-update-adds-notepad-tabs-iphone-pairing-and-a-dash-of-ai/\">window tabs</a>.</p>\n<p>Given Microsoft's continuing obsession with all things AI, it's perhaps not surprising that <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/11/06/new-ai-experiences-for-paint-and-notepad-begin-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/\">the app's latest update</a> (currently in preview for Canary and Dev Windows Insiders) is a generative AI feature called Rewrite that promises to adjust the length, tone, and phrasing of highlighted sentences or paragraphs using generative AI. Users will be offered three rewritten options based on what they've highlighted, and they can select the one they like best or tell the app to try again.</p>\n<p>Rewrite appears to be based on the same technology as the Copilot assistant, since it uses cloud-side processing (rather than your local CPU, GPU, or NPU) and requires Microsoft account sign-in to work. The initial preview is available to users in the US, France, the UK, Canada, Italy, and Germany.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/notepad-exe-now-an-actively-maintained-app-has-gotten-its-inevitable-ai-update/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/notepad-exe-now-an-actively-maintained-app-has-gotten-its-inevitable-ai-update/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"94d53022d56a8e57be4275690b65edfaf283a1693a3f467f87b9e9662e1fe070","category":"Tech"}
