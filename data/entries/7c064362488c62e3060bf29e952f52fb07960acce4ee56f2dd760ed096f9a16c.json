The whistle includes an integrated attachment feature for added versatility.</blockquote>In October, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/apple-releases-polishing-cloth/\">Apple released a Polishing Cloth</a> for $19 which quickly became the subject of ridicule due to its presentation and pricing. Musk had already <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1451639434378678272?s=20\">expressed amusement</a> at the Apple Cloth after its release, and in a follow up tweet, he drew a comparison between Tesla's spoof product and Apple's Polishing Cloth. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Don’t waste your money on that silly Apple Cloth, buy our whistle instead!</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1465842137392680963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 1, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Tesla Cyberwhistle was available for $50 and is already sold out.
