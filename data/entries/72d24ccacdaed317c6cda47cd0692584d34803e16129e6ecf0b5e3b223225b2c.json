He continued: “They literally said, ‘Please don’t talk to her,’ having nothing to do with what you do for a living. I think they just … I didn’t think they cared for you, is what happened.”</p>\n\n<p>Stewart had a brief stint on Apple TV from 2021 to 2023 with a show called “The Problem With Jon Stewart,” which had an accompanying podcast. The partnership ended over creative differences last fall. Stewart returned to Comedy Central as a part-time “Daily Show” host in February.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The thing I don’t understand about this is why Apple ever hired Stewart to do that show, or why Stewart agreed to do that show with Apple. Based on, you know, the entire body of Stewart’s work, it’s obvious that Lina Khan is exactly the sort of person he’d want to interview. It’s not like something changed. My only guess is that the part of Apple that agreed to host <em>The Problem With Jon Stewart</em> didn’t get buy-in from the top of the company. But I find that hard to believe. It just doesn’t make sense. It’s like hiring <em>Martha</em> Stewart to do a show and then asking her not to do any cooking segments.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I think Apple should put its big boy pants on and gladly host a topical news show that is free to criticize the company or the technology industry as a whole. John Oliver regularly skewered then-HBO owner AT&amp;T and now skewers new owner Warner Bros. Discovery on <em>Last Week Tonight</em>. It’s an age-old tradition. Letterman lambasting NBC execs. Or the time <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOEBgSBfko0\">Letterman tried to deliver a welcoming fruit basket to GE headquarters</a> after they bought NBC (stay with that one through the end to learn the official General Electric corporate handshake).</p>\n\n<p>But the real problem with <em>The Problem With Jon Stewart</em> was that the show stunk and no one watched it. I’m a big Jon Stewart fan and watch a bunch of shows in the same basic genre (I never miss <em>Last Week Tonight</em> and most weeks we watch Bill Maher’s <em>Real Time</em>). And now I’m once again enjoying Stewart in his Monday spot hosting <em>The Daily Show</em>. But <em>The Problem With Jon Stewart</em> just wasn’t good. Now, thanks to this outed dirty laundry about a conflict with Apple over political subject matter, there are people who think that’s the sole reason why the show was cancelled. That surely played a part. But the main reason is almost certainly that the ratings stunk. What’s weird about the streaming era of TV is that streaming services are incredibly secretive about ratings — that’s the complete opposite of over-the-air TV and theatrical box office numbers for movies, where viewership numbers were public. If the viewership numbers for <em>The Problem With Jon Stewart</em> had been public, everyone would’ve surmised that Apple cancelled the show because it wasn’t popular, not because he wanted to interview Lina Khan (on the podcast even — not the show itself!) or express misgivings about the tech industry.</p>\n\n<p>It’s just a real head-scratcher why Apple ever wanted to host the show in the first place. Even if it <em>had</em> been entertaining and thus popular, it seems clear Apple wasn’t comfortable with Jon Stewart talking about Jon Stewart topics.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/14/stewart-apple-khan\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"72d24ccacdaed317c6cda47cd0692584d34803e16129e6ecf0b5e3b223225b2c","category":"Tech"}
