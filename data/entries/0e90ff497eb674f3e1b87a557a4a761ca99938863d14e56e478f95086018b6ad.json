The first season ended in April 2022, so fans have waited a long time for the show to return, partly due to the Writers Guild of America going on strike last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe sci-fi series revolves around the mysterious company Lumon Industries, whose employees cannot recall any memories about their personal lives while they are at work. Similarly, the employees cannot remember anything about the workplace when they are out of the office. In the second season, Apple says the employees \"learn the dire consequences of trifling with the severance barrier, leading them further down a path of woe.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\"Severance\" was created by Dan Erickson, and Ben Stiller serves as an executive producer. The series has an ensemble cast, including Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Zach Cherry, Christopher Walken, and others.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the U.S., Apple TV+ costs $9.99 per month or $99 per year, and the service is included in all Apple One subscription bundles. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-tv-plus-severance-season-two-teaser/\">Apple TV+ Shares Another Teaser Trailer for 'Severance' Season 2</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-shares-another-teaser-trailer-for-severance-season-2.2440766/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0e90ff497eb674f3e1b87a557a4a761ca99938863d14e56e478f95086018b6ad","category":"Apple"}
