Check out the Polisport S-Mud clip-on fender, which attaches and detaches from your saddle rails in seconds.</p><p>No more sloppy <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/06/25/best-bike-multitools-minitools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multitool</a> install/uninstall. No more unnecessarily rocking a fender in dry conditions just because you’re lazy. In fact, if you’re lazy (but not on the bike), the S-Mud is your soulmate.</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXtKzk3otg0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" ezoid=\"0.07666700998006215\"></iframe></p><p>You can even put it on with one hand (says the brand), which, we must admit, posits a new method for mudguard use. Got a sunny day, but a huge puddle up ahead, and no mudguard? Step 1: Speed up and reach into your backpack to locate the S-Mud femder. Step 2: Keep speeding up, clip it on while you pedal, and go to town.</p><p>When you’re all done splashing about, just unclip it. And when you reach your destination? No embarrassing streak on your shirt that, depending on the crowd, you might have to explain.</p><p>I wish I could say the S-Mud fender was less simple than that; it’s not. The only complication is the angle adjustment, for which you need a #5 Allen key. It’s one of those things that gave us instant “why didn’t we think of that?” syndrome.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26151135/IMG_3334.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26151135/IMG_3334.jpg 1000w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26151135/IMG_3334-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26151135/IMG_3334-800x534.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26151135/IMG_3334-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26151135/IMG_3334-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26151135/IMG_3334.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26151135/IMG_3334.jpg 1000w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26151135/IMG_3334-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26151135/IMG_3334-800x534.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26151135/IMG_3334-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26151135/IMG_3334-768x512.jpg 768w\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.polisport.com/en/bicycle/mudguards/rear/s-mud-rear-bicycle-mudguard-for-saddle-rails-short-version_p4037.html?id=596&amp;cat=582&amp;pc=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">It’s available</a> in two sizes that fit any wheel between 26″ and 29″.
