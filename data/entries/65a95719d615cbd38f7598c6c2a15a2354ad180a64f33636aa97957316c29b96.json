The Mk 8 Golf is due for a mid-life refresh next year, and when that happens, VW will be simplifying things by dropping the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/the-final-shift-which-manual-transmission-will-be-the-last/\">manual transmission</a> option. That means model year 2024 is the final chance anyone will have to buy a GTI with three pedals. Yes, it has some flaws, but it's also small and nimble, both attributes lacking in so much of what the automotive industry has to offer these days.</p>\n<p>We've been a bit deficient in not reviewing the Mk 8 Golf GTI until now. I reviewed the more expensive, more powerful Golf R <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/volkswagen-has-given-the-2022-golf-r-an-extreme-personality-change/\">in 2022</a>, but the last GTI we drove was the outgoing Mk 7 car <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/06/the-2020-vw-golf-gti-proves-you-shouldnt-overcomplicate-an-icon/\">in mid-2020</a>. That time, we were only able to source a GTI with the two-pedal, dual-clutch gearbox, a transmission I felt didn't quite suit the engine it was mated to. On the other hand, I was effusive about the old GTI's infotainment, calling it \"one of the best systems on the market.\" Well, it was 2020, remember.</p>\n<p>Under the hood, you'll find yet another version of VW Group's venerable EA888 four-cylinder engine, here with a turbocharger and direct injection. It generates 241 hp (180 kW) and 273 lb-ft (370 Nm), with that peak torque arriving at just 1,750 rpm. This sends its power to the front wheels via a seven-speed DSG or the soon-to-be retired six-speed manual.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049026#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049026&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
