With brands (Mavic included) leaning into budget-friendly carbon wheels, it’s nice to see a performance-driven alloy wheel hold its own, especially one that looks to blur the lines of all-road and gravel wheelsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6217-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6217-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-lone-wheel--scaled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6217-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6217-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6217-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6217-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6217-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_6217-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(All Photos: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mavic AllRoad Line</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mavic AllRoad SL wheelset is part of the brand’s movement into the gravel and larger volume side of drop-bar life. The All Road line dropped with four variations of the wheelset. The entry point is the AllRoad disc (also available in 650b), followed by AllRoad S with more premium features. Then, fading into the race-ready designs; AllRoad SL and AllRoad SL Carbon, both hookless.

start at the rim: Mavic runs a modern 25mm internal on the AllRoad rims – although some brands are now edging towards<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bontrager-paradigm-30-wide-gravel-wheels-review/\"> 29mm</a> (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/zipp-303-xplr-sw-gravel-wheels/\">and upwards</a>) internals on all-road and gravel-focused wheels. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a

Mavic’s favor for the AllRoad line. The rim’s profile adapts to a reasonably large road, cyclocross, or gravel tire (anywhere from 28-40mm) without distorting the shape. Mavic claims the wheels can accommodate up to a 64mm tire, but I think that might be pushing it. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-details--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-details--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-details--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-details--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-details--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-details--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-details--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-details--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-details--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Rim depth at its shallowest point</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rim shape is classic Mavic: bare sculpted alloy, SUP welded with a slight variable height (20mm/22mm). It is hookless, tapeless, and well-crafted. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-center-lock--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-center-lock--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels center lock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-center-lock--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-center-lock--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-center-lock--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-center-lock--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-center-lock--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-center-lock--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-center-lock--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What about the Hubs? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AllRoad SL uses the Mavic Infinity Hub with Instant Drive 360, a tech you’ll see on most of their high-end wheels. The Instant Drive 360 uses drive rings similar to other ring drive hubs on the market and are very easy to service and swap out (more on this later)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Presentation and Packaging </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When my Mavic AllRoad wheels arrived, they came in a thick box with lots of cardboard padding. They shipped with nearly everything I needed to service the wheels and freehub body. Plus, there are some Mavic stickers that every shop has plastered on work stands. What I’m trying to say is that they came with intention. These wheels were meant for use, day in and day out, so you’ll need to service and care for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-rear-1-1-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-rear-1-1-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels weight rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-rear-1-1-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-rear-1-1-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-rear-1-1-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-rear-1-1-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-rear-1-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-rear-1-1-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-rear-1-1-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Mavic AllRoad SL Wheel weight rear </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-front--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-front--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels weight front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-front--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-front--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-front--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-front--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-front--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-front--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-weight-front--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Mavic AllRoad SL Wheel weight front</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve seen beautiful wheelsets upward of $3K ship in a cardboard box I wouldn’t ship a tire in. These $950 Mavic wheels arrived in a way that ensured a solid customer experience. It’s small things, but I was impressed with the thoughtful care. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was slightly bummed to see that no extra spokes came with the wheels. Some wheel manufacturers going above and beyond lately have made a few extra spokes part of the purchase. Hopefully, we will see something like this soon from Mavic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-side-wall--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-side-wall--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels side wall\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-side-wall--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-side-wall--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-side-wall--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-side-wall--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-side-wall--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-side-wall--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-side-wall--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tubeless Setup </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s always a good thing when the setup is uneventful, and I don’t get Stan’s everywhere. The AllRoad SL was uneventful and effortless. No taping or real work was required. I installed the provided valve and my set of Vittoria (Ride Armor 32mm) tires, and I was good to roll. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mavic valves are slotted to accommodate tire liners and rim savers for those who choose that life. The rims, though hookless, are still reasonably narrow, with a bead around 2mm thick. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>A note:</strong> It’s best to check the side wall of your go-to tires before committing to a hookless rim. Though most tires over size 28mm are approved for hookless, it might surprise you that some aren’t. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-logo-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-logo-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-logo-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-logo-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-logo-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-logo-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-logo-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-logo-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-logo-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Classic Styling </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mavic is classic and still has the classic yellow and black styling that this Pittsburgh’r loves – not only because it’s the <a href=\"https://www.nhl.com/penguins/schedule\">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>‘ colors.

I mounted them on a review road bike and hit some of my favorite pave’. The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/trek-madone-gen-8/\">Trek Madone frameset</a> accommodated the 32mm tires well enough, and I got a taste of the wheels’ performance on the tarmac. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I initially thought, <em>“These are comfy.”</em> Having spent many miles on the current test rig, I knew it was the wheels. The Mavic AllRoad SLs replaced the 42mm deep Bontrager carbon wheels on the Trek. The weight was nearly the same between the wheels, but the profile and ride quality drastically differed. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-gravel--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1846\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-gravel--scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-gravel-\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-gravel--scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-gravel--297x214.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-gravel--800x577.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-gravel--120x87.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-gravel--768x554.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-gravel--1536x1107.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-gravel--2048x1477.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>All Day Comfort </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking solely on the wheels’ comfort and ride quality (not aero-efficiency), I felt more excited to take on a long day in the saddle. The larger-volume 32mm Vittoria tires paired well with the 25mm internal of the AllRoad SLs and seemed mated for each other. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Climbing and chugging along on the flats, the AllRoad SLs performed well. They were stiff and responsive (though not as stiff as the carbon wheels they replaced) and were an asset on poorly maintained roads. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Challenge-Gravine-Gravel-Tire-front--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Challenge-Gravine-Gravel-Tire-front--scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Gravine Gravel Tire front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Challenge-Gravine-Gravel-Tire-front--scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Challenge-Gravine-Gravel-Tire-front--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Challenge-Gravine-Gravel-Tire-front--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Challenge-Gravine-Gravel-Tire-front--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Challenge-Gravine-Gravel-Tire-front--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Challenge-Gravine-Gravel-Tire-front--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Challenge-Gravine-Gravel-Tire-front--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What About Gravel? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My gravel times on the AllRoad SLs weren’t limited to cobbled old Pittsburgh roads. I took these guys out on proper chunky bits. I had them paired with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/challenge-tires-gravine-gravel-tire/\">Challenge Gravine tires</a>, and the match was perfect. The shallow rims’ forgiving nature, paired with the supple cotton casing of the Challenge tire, worked out well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What the AllRoad alloy wheels lack in aerodynamics compared to their carbon brethren, they make up for in ride comfort and nostalgic looks. I raced Mavic Ksyrium SLs on the road for years, and when I look at the AllRoad SLs, I get a slight memory flicker of those super cool wheels with the single yellow spoke. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hub Performance </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mavic Infinity Hub with Instant Drive 360 has just enough engagement for road and gravel. Mavic equips the AllRoad SL with the 24-tooth (15-deg of engagement) Instant Drive 360 driver. Those looking for more can upgrade (it’s a super easy job) to the 72-tooth driver with 9-deg of engagement. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-instadrive-360--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-instadrive-360--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels instadrive 360\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-instadrive-360--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-instadrive-360--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-instadrive-360--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-instadrive-360--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-instadrive-360--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-instadrive-360--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-drive-360-internals--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-drive-360-internals--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels drive 360 internals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-drive-360-internals--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-drive-360-internals--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-drive-360-internals--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-drive-360-internals--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-drive-360-internals--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels hub service\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for weather resistance, I’ve ridden these wheels in all weather. I’ve even thrown in a bike wash with a pressure washer a few times after muddy gravel rides, just for good measure. The bearings are just as smooth as the day I received them, and even with many dings, the rims are surprisingly dent-free. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-pirelli-40-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-pirelli-40-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels pirelli 40\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-pirelli-40-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-pirelli-40-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-pirelli-40-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-pirelli-40-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-pirelli-40-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-pirelli-40-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-pirelli-40-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Is that a 40mm Pirelli P Zero? Yes…</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For under $1000 ($950, to be exact), the Mavic AllRoad SL wheels are very much worth it. Yes, Mavic just released a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mavic-cosmic-s-carbon-42-wheelset/\">$1000 performance carbon wheel</a>. But is it as comfortable a ride as the AllRoads? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a rider who likes to mix things up—gravel one day, a road ride over the weekend—and want one wheelset to do it all, the AllRoad SLs are it. The weight is a slight drawback, but the performance, comfort, and styling stick out in a world full of harsh riding budget carbon wheels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mavic.com/en-us/p/allroad-sl-rr2306?variant=7397\">Mavic.com</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-mavic-allroad-sl-wheels/\">Mavic Allroad SL Wheels Are Classically Designed &amp; Dependable All-Arounders  </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"857c458979cd61a3c584865b124057b81077765f4a16489aa476397ecaec7bb7","category":"Cycling"}
