{"title":"Video Comparison: M1 MacBook Pro vs. M1 Pro MacBook Pro","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/05/m1-macbook-pro-vs-m1-pro-macbook-pro/","date":1636142721000,"content":"If you're unsure whether you should purchase a MacBook Pro with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/\">M1 Pro</a> chip or if an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> machine will best suit your needs, our latest YouTube video is for you. We've compared the 14-inch base MacBook Pro with ‌M1 Pro‌ chip to the 13-inch base MacBook Pro with ‌M1‌ chip to give our readers an idea of how they measure up to one another.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div><div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌M1‌ MacBook Pro is priced starting at $1,299, and it comes with an ‌M1‌ chip that features an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU, along with 8GB memory and a 256GB SSD.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe base 14-inch ‌M1 Pro‌ MacBook Pro is priced starting at $1,999 and has an 8-core CPU, a 14-core GPU, 16GB memory, and a 512GB SSD. Upgraded models of the ‌M1 Pro‌ come with a 10-core CPU and 16-core GPU, but we're comparing the two base models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's 14-inch ‌M1 Pro‌ MacBook Pro is $700 more expensive than the ‌M1‌ model, but as you'll see in our video, it's much more capable. It has a brighter, crisper display that makes a noticeable difference and additional ports. There's one more USB-C/Thunderbolt port, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> charging port, an HDMI port, and an SD card reader. Speakers probably aren't a major selling point for most people, but the sound is much improved, and there's also a somewhat better webcam at 1080p vs. 720p.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are clear performance differences with the ‌M1‌ and ‌M1 Pro‌ when it comes to Geekbench scores. The ‌M1‌ MacBook Pro earned a single-core score of 1705 and a multi-core score of 7385, along with an OpenCL score of 18480. In comparison, the 14-inch MacBook Pro earned a single-core score of 1763, a multi-core score of 9823, and an OpenCL score of 30569, which is a decent improvement in multi-core and graphics performance. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis does translate to real-world usage as well. Rendering a 4K timeline in Final Cut Pro took the ‌M1 Pro‌ MacBook Pro about 2 minutes and 55 seconds, but the ‌M1‌ MacBook Pro took 3 minutes and 40 seconds, which is a notable difference. The ‌M1 Pro‌ MacBook Pro was able to handle 8K footage with no problem, but the ‌M1‌ MacBook Pro struggled.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSo is the 14-inch MacBook Pro worth the premium? Sure, if you need the kind of power that it delivers. If you're just going to be reading emails, browsing the web, and doing other lightweight tasks, the ‌M1‌ chip is more than sufficient. As a note, though, if you're considering an ‌M1‌ MacBook, it's probably best to go with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, a thinner and lighter machine that is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon-macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro/\">nearly as powerful</a> and $300 less expensive than the ‌M1‌ MacBook Pro, saving you even more money.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you need more power for pro-level tasks like video editing, sound editing, photography, and similar purposes, shelling out an extra $700 may be well worth it given the benefits of the ‌M1 Pro‌, the extra 8GB memory you get with the base machine, and the additional storage space compared to base ‌M1‌ options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMake sure to watch our video for the full comparison, and let us know in the comments if you think the ‌M1 Pro‌ MacBook Pros are worth the additional money over the ‌M1‌ machines.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Note:</b> Our YouTube video and article have been republished after we addressed an error with the Geekbench scores.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">13\" MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14 &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/05/m1-macbook-pro-vs-m1-pro-macbook-pro/\">Video Comparison: M1 MacBook Pro vs. M1 Pro MacBook Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/video-comparison-m1-macbook-pro-vs-m1-pro-macbook-pro.2321962/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CkpkF6BlZlA:lrdPwRS7d0w:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CkpkF6BlZlA:lrdPwRS7d0w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/CkpkF6BlZlA\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f5d231b369654341667b1118790d7ebf8b4a559d55a0a0a3eb9d93ac858060fc","category":"Apple"}
