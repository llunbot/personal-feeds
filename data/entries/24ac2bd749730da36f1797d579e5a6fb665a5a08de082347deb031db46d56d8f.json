In March this year, Microsoft announced <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/06/introducing-microsoft-dynamics-365-copilot/\">Dynamics 365 Copilot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/copilot-ai-features\">Copilot in Windows</a>, <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/28/introducing-microsoft-security-copilot-empowering-defenders-at-the-speed-of-ai/\">Microsoft Security Copilot</a>, and <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/\">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a>. Now Bing Chat is just \"Microsoft Copilot\"—its sixth copilot so far. Pretty soon, Microsoft will need a Branding Copilot to keep them all straight.</p>\n<p>Regarding the naming scheme, Microsoft customer Amit Malik took to X and <a href=\"https://x.com/amit_malik99/status/1704918893993857445?s=20\">wrote</a>, \"I love Microsoft, but this whole copilot thing is becoming more confusing than it should be. Microsoft Copilot, Windows Copilot, M365 Copilot, then all the m365 apps, D365 copilot and so on. AI was supposed to simplify, not otherwise.\" Note that Malik wrote that in September—nearly two months before the recent announcement.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984093#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984093&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"24ac2bd749730da36f1797d579e5a6fb665a5a08de082347deb031db46d56d8f","category":"Tech"}
