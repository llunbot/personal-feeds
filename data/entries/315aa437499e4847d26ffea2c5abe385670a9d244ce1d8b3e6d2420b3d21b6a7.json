The Federal Communications Commission issued an <a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-1193A1.pdf\">order</a> that partially grants SpaceX's application while imposing conditions and deferring a decision on some aspects of the application.</p>\n<p>Starlink received approval to provide Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) within the United States. This means that in areas not covered by terrestrial cellular networks, Starlink satellites can provide service to cell phones. SpaceX already had approval to launch 7,500 second-generation satellites for its existing broadband service, and the new approval allows mobile service from those satellites.</p>\n<p>The approval lets Starlink and T-Mobile move ahead with their plan to provide satellite service to phones in cellular dead spots. SpaceX is authorized to use the 1910–1915 MHz (Earth-to-space) and 1990–1995 MHz (space-to-Earth) bands for SCS pursuant to its lease agreement with T-Mobile. The lease covers the continental US, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/fcc-approves-starlink-plan-for-cellular-phone-service-with-some-limits/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/fcc-approves-starlink-plan-for-cellular-phone-service-with-some-limits/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"315aa437499e4847d26ffea2c5abe385670a9d244ce1d8b3e6d2420b3d21b6a7","category":"Tech"}
