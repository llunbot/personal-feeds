Today, LG became the latest OEM to announce a foldable-screen laptop, right after HP announced its first attempt, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/hps-5000-spectre-foldable-pc-has-a-lot-to-prove/\">Spectre Foldable PC</a>, earlier this month.</p>\n<p>LG only announced the Gram Fold in South Korea thus far. LG didn't immediately respond when I asked if it has plans to release the machine in the US.</p>\n<p>A Google translation of LG's Korean announcement said the laptop is 9.4-mm (0.37-inches) thick when unfolded and used like a 17-inch tablet. Alternatively, the OLED PC can be folded in half to use like an approximately 12.2-inch laptop. In the latter form, a virtual keyboard can appear on the bottom screen, and you can dock a Bluetooth keyboard to the bottom screen or pair a keyboard with the system wirelessly. The screen has 1920Ã—2560 pixels for a pixel density of 188.2 pixels per inch.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970796#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970796&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"482626d09458036c1399a329911818f15511cdeab39149a7567ba87f0b2ef92b","category":"Tech"}
