Apple just launched these earbuds last month and their headlining new feature is the addition of a USB-C port on the MagSafe Charging Case, replacing the Lightning port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$60 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for $189.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are a few minor changes to the AirPods Pro 2 besides the addition of USB-C, including additional dust resistance and support for lossless audio with the Vision Pro headset. Apple doesn't sell the USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case separately, so if you want USB-C support you'll have to purchase a full new set of earbuds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe will continue to track Prime Early Access deals as the event continues, so be sure to keep an eye on our front page for more news.
