Congratulations, you’ve reached your daily reading goal.” A big blue checkmark accompanied it. The only problem? I had never set a reading goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get enough pressure from reminders, alarms, timers, calendar events, and other popups and notifications in our lives that one more might push us over the edge. For me, this reading goal was it: I certainly didn’t need any help tracking my personal reading.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mac911-reading-goal.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iOS Books Reading Goal\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mac911-reading-goal.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1179w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mac911-reading-goal.jpeg?resize=300%2C114&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mac911-reading-goal.jpeg?resize=768%2C292&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"389\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>That’s one notification in my life I don’t need.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iOS Books Reading Goal\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mac911-reading-goal.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1179w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mac911-reading-goal.jpeg?resize=300%2C114&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mac911-reading-goal.jpeg?resize=768%2C292&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"389\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>That’s one notification in my life I don’t need.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iOS Books Reading Goal\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mac911-reading-goal.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1179w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mac911-reading-goal.jpeg?resize=300%2C114&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mac911-reading-goal.jpeg?resize=768%2C292&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"389\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>That’s one notification in my life I don’t need.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal isn’t set within a book or the Books app, of course. Go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Books</em> in iOS/iPadOS and disable <em>Reading Goals</em> near the bottom. The label says, “Show time spent reading and other achievements in Apple Books.” In macOS go to <em>Books &gt; Settings/Preferences &gt; General</em> and uncheck <em>Enable Reading Goals</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know what these other achievements might be, and I know it’s useful for some people to create targets and get positive feedback for meeting them. If you’re like me, however, you can stifle this additional detail, one I don’t recall ever being prompted about or turning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
