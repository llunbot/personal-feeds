After reiterating his own country's climate pledges, Xi said that China would start making it easier for other countries to keep emissions in check: new support for renewable energy projects and an end to construction of coal plants.</p>\n<p>China finances a lot of infrastructure projects in developing economies as part of its foreign policy efforts; these often have the side benefits of involving Chinese companies and engineers. When these projects involved production of electricity, they often involved China's most heavily used source: coal. As such, the number of coal plants slated for construction in the developing world was large and raised legitimate questions about the prospect of meeting any global carbon emissions targets.</p>\n<p>China had already committed to having its emissions peak at the end of this decade and to reach carbon neutrality by 2060. But until this point, its development banks were continuing to finance coal plants, and its companies would often construct them. In a recorded speech played at the UN today, however, Xi indicated that this would stop: \"China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797228#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797228&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3ad907df65d908d80a80a7c88319c2592921c2451f715b7e61ed18263ab0541b","category":"Tech"}
