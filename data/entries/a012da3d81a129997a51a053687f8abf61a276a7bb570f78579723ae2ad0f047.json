Say it like a long-pole track and field athlete. Still struggling? You will definitely get there if you’re a fan of the first Spanish WorldTour race of the season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only don’t call this climb Spanish. Sure, it’s in Spain, but to anyone local the Vallter is categorically in Catalunya. Its name is Catalan for ‘valley’ after all.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/rocacorba-cycling\">Classic climb: Rocacorba, the most celebrated climb never used in a pro race</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/spain-girona-cycling\">Big Ride: Girona, city of stars</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/plateau-de-beille-cycling\">Classic climb: Plateau de Beille, the Tour summit finish that always delivers</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Said valley is in fact the <em>Parc Natural de les Capçaleres del Ter i el Freser</em> – obviously – and as a landscape it is gallery-worthy.

Whether or not it mattered much to him one can only guess, but the local tourist board was evidently delighted, granting real-life road rights over the segment’s start and finish lines: just outside the village of Setcases lies a band of tangelo-painted tarmac inscribed with the words ‘Strava start segment’.

Don’t expect this first stretch to be easy, but with the gradient remaining well below 10% you shouldn’t find yourself struggling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The road, now only just wide enough for two vehicles travelling in opposite directions to not touch mirrors, snakes gently round to the northwest. There are no tight turns but nor is it straight enough to frustrate. You’ll feel you’re making progress as the view over your handlebars changes rewardingly with every stroke. The surface is pale and imperfect, but it is not sufficiently scarred as to be uncomfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Getting closer</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-07-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Vallter 2000\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-07-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-07-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-07.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Set alongside the Ter river that has shaped this landscape, Setcases is a year-round magnet for active tourists of the hiking, skiing and biking variety.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>By the mid-climb squiggle the walls haven’t literally closed in, but this is where the flora is at its most dense, drawing the darkness near.

The arrhythmic clunk of their bells warns rather than encourages your progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These five switchbacks will eat the better part of 300m out of the remaining elevation. As you rise above the treeline and the gradient relents, you would feel freer to breathe were it not for how noticeably thinner the air feels.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-08-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Vallter 2000\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-08-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-08-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-08-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-08-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-08.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>You’re more than halfway there.

The road steepens gradually before you reach the first of six car parks and, of rather more interest, the second set of hairpins poised to take you to the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eleven in all, each hairpin is labelled with the name of a different WorldTour race. All the Grand Tours are there, along with every Monument except one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quite why Milan-San Remo has been denied a bend is a mystery, but both Strade Bianche and the San Sebastian Classic make the cut ahead of La Primavera. At Il Lombardia you pass a large circle with an H in the middle, a reminder of the Vallter 2000’s altitude.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Vallter 2000\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/vallter-2000-classic-climb-10.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>You’ve arrived at the Vallter 2000 Estació d’esquí ski (and increasingly) cycling station.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The final bend, less a switchback than a fast right-hander, comes after 400 give-it-everything metres and is named in honour of – what else – the Volta a Catalunya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your arrival, into another car park, is inauspicious, but it’s about the journey not the destination.
