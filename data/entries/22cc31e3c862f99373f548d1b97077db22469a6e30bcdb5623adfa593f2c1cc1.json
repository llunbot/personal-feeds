{"title":"The Internet Archive Unveils Marble Bust of Aaron Swartz","link":"https://sfstandard.com/2025/02/08/aaron-swartz-marble-statue-unveiled-internet-archive/","date":1739066087000,"content":"\n<p>Zara Stone, reporting for The Standard:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“There’s a renaissance happening now in Aaron Swartz-land,” said\nLisa Rein, the co-founder of Creative Commons, a nonprofit devoted\nto expanding public access to information. She founded Aaron\nSwartz Day in 2013, an annual hackathon and tribute held on his\nbirthday. There’s now an Aaron Swartz Institute in Brazil, a\ndocumentary, multiple books and podcasts — even an Aaron Swartz\nmemecoin (“Do not buy,” she warned).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Aaron, I know, would have laughed at that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Twitch and a partner at Y\nCombinator, was one of the few people who knew Swartz personally.\n“I’m glad he’s become a symbol, he would approve of that,” he\nshared, his voice slightly breaking. “I really miss him.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I miss him too. Man. But I find it weird that there were “few people who knew him” at the event. So many people knew him. That’s part of what made Aaron <em>Aaron</em> — he knew everyone interesting on the internet at the time.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/08/swartz-monument\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"22cc31e3c862f99373f548d1b97077db22469a6e30bcdb5623adfa593f2c1cc1","category":"Tech"}
