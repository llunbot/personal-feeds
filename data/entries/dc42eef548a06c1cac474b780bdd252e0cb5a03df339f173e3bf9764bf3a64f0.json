{"title":"Welcome to AWS Storage Day 2023","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/welcome-to-aws-storage-day-2023/","date":1691596634000,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://pages.awscloud.com/NAMER-field-OE-AWS-Storage-Day-2023-reg-event.html\">fifth annual AWS Storage Day</a> took place on Aug. 9, 2023 and<a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1894274060\"> you can see the replay here</a>. The first AWS Storage Day was hosted in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/welcome-to-aws-storage-day/\">2019</a>, and this event has grown into an innovation day that we look forward to delivering to you every year. In <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/welcome-to-aws-storage-day-2022/\">last year’s Storage Day post</a>, I wrote about the constant innovations in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/products/storage/\">AWS Storage</a> aimed at helping you put your data to work while keeping it secure and protected. This year, Storage Day is focused on storage for AI/ML, data protection and resiliency, and the benefits of moving to the cloud.</p> \n<p><span><strong>AWS Storage Day Key Themes<br /> </strong></span>When it comes to <strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/infrastructure/\">storage for AI/ML</a></strong>, data volumes are increasing at an unprecedented rate, exploding from terabytes to petabytes and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/snap-case-study/\">even to exabytes</a>. With a modern data architecture on AWS, you can rapidly build <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/datalakes-and-analytics/datalakes/\">scalable data lakes</a>, use a broad and deep collection of purpose-built data services, scale your systems at a low cost without compromising performance, share data across organizational boundaries, and manage compliance, security, and governance, allowing you to make decisions with speed and agility at scale.<br /> To train machine learning models and build <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/\">Generative AI applications</a>, you must have the right data strategy in place. So, I’m happy to see that, among the list of sessions to look forward to at the live event, the <em>Optimize generative AI and ML with AWS Infrastructure</em> session will discuss how you can transform your data into meaningful insights.</p> \n<p>Whether you’re just getting started with the cloud, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-migration/\">planning to migrate applications to AWS</a>, or already building applications on AWS, we have resources to help you <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/products/storage/data-resilience/\">protect your data and meet your business continuity</a> objectives. Our <strong>data protection</strong> and <strong>resiliency</strong> features and solutions can help you meet your business continuity goals and deliver disaster recovery during data loss events, across recovery point and time objectives (RPO and RTO). With the unprecedented data growth happening in the world today, determining where your data is stored, how it’s secured, and who has access to it is a higher priority than ever. Be sure to join the <em>Protect data in AWS amid a rapidly evolving cyber landscape</em> session to learn more.</p> \n<p>When <strong>moving </strong>data <strong>to the cloud</strong>, you need to understand where you’re moving it for different use cases, the types of data you’re moving, and the network resources available, among other considerations. There are many reasons to move to the cloud, recently, <a href=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/AWS%20Cloud%20Storage/Save-Up-to-66-Percent-by-Migrating-to-AWS-Cloud-Infrastructure.pdf\">Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) validated</a> that organizations reduced compute, networking, and storage costs by up to 66 percent by migrating on-premises workloads to AWS Cloud infrastructure. ESG confirmed that migrating on-premises workloads to AWS provides organizations with reduced costs, increased performance, improved operational efficiency, faster time to value, and improved business agility.<a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/08/04/ESG-Economic-Validation-Findings.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/08/04/ESG-Economic-Validation-Findings-1024x482.png\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"482\" /></a><br /> We have a number of sessions that discuss how to move to the cloud, based on your use case. I’m most looking forward to the <em>Hybrid cloud storage and edge compute: AWS, where you need it</em> session, which will discuss considerations for workloads that can’t fully move to the cloud.</p> \n<p>Tune in to learn from experts about new announcements, leadership insights, and educational content related to the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/products/storage/\">broad portfolio of AWS Storage services</a> and features that address all these themes and more.

If you were one of the original users who put Amazon EBS to good use and provided us with the very helpful feedback that helped us invent and simplify, iterate and improve, I’m sure you can’t believe how time flies. Today, Amazon EBS handles more than 100 trillion I/O operations daily, and over 390 million EBS volumes are created every day.</p> \n<p>If you’re new to Amazon EBS, join us for a fireside chat with Matt Garman, Senior Vice President, Sales, Marketing, and Global Services at AWS, and learn the strategy and customer challenges behind the launch of the service in 2008. You’ll also hear from long-term EBS customer, Stripe, about its growth with EBS since Stripe was launched 12 years ago.</p> \n<p>Amazon EBS has continuously improved its scalability and performance to support more customer workloads as the direct storage attachment for Amazon EC2 instances. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-seventh-generation-general-purpose-amazon-ec2-instances-m7i-flex-and-m7i/\">With the launch of Amazon EC2 M7i instances</a>, powered by custom 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors, on August 2, you can attach up to 128 Amazon EBS volumes, an increase from 28 on a previous generation M6i instance. The higher number of volume attachments means you can increase storage density per instance and improve resource utilization, reducing total compute cost.</p> \n<p>You can host up to 127 containers per instance for larger database applications and scale them more cost effectively before needing to provision more instances and only pay for resources you need. With a higher number of volume attachments, you can fully utilize the memory and vCPU available on these powerful M7i instances as your database storage footprint grows. EBS is also increasing the number of multi-volume snapshots you can create, for up to 128 EBS volumes attached to an instance, enabling you to create crash-consistent backups of all volumes attached to an instance.</p> \n<p>Join the <em>15 years of innovations with Amazon EBS</em> session for a discussion about how the original vision for Amazon EBS has evolved to meet your growing demands for cloud infrastructure.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Mountpoint for Amazon S3</strong></span><br /> Now generally available, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/mountpoint/\">Mountpoint for Amazon S3</a> is a new open source file client that delivers high throughput access, lowering compute costs for data lakes on Amazon S3.
