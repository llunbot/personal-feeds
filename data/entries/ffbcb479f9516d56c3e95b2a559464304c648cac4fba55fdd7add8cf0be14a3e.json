Broadcom famously <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/\">ended perpetual VMware license</a> sales shortly after closing its acquisition in favor of a subscription model featuring about two bundles of products rather than many SKUs.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T claims its VMware contract (forged before <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/05/broadcom-will-pay-61-billion-to-become-the-latest-company-to-acquire-vmware/\">Broadcom's acquisition</a> closed in November) entitles it to three one-year renewals of perpetual license support, and it's currently trying to enact the second one. AT&amp;T says it uses VMware products to run 75,000 virtual machines (VMs) across about 8,600 servers. The VMs are for supporting customer services operations and operations management efficiency, per AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T is asking the Supreme Court of the State of New York to stop Broadcom from ending VMware support services for AT&amp;T and for \"further relief\" as deemed necessary.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052026#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052026&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ffbcb479f9516d56c3e95b2a559464304c648cac4fba55fdd7add8cf0be14a3e","category":"Tech"}
