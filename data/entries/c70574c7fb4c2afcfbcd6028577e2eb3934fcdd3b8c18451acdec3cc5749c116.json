They actively share knowledge about HashiCorp tools through content creation, participation in local events, and productive, thoughtful feedback, while advocating for and adhering to the <a href=\"http://hashicorp.com/our-principles\">HashiCorp Principles</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We are proud that participants in this program share knowledge openly and broadly, benefiting the entire community by making our tools more accessible, and we look forward to increasing their engagement and impact within our community and organization.</p>\n\n<h2>Apply or nominate someone to be a HashiCorp Ambassador</h2>\n\n<p>Have you, or someone you know, created content or organized events around HashiCorp tools? Has someone been particularly helpful in your learning or insightful with their feedback? </p>\n\n<p>We are now accepting HashiCorp Ambassador <a href=\"http://hashicorp.com/ambassador/submissions\">nominations and applications</a> from community members who have been active in 2024 to recognize them for sharing knowledge around HashiCorp tools. This work makes our community more vibrant and collaborative, and supports the health of the broader ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>Please reflect over the past year and consider those who have helped you on your journey with our tools and how they engaged with you. Please share those stories by submitting a <a href=\"http://hashicorp.com/ambassador/submissions\">nomination or application</a>, including specific examples of how these potential HashiCorp Ambassadors engaged within the community by Wednesday, January 31, 2025.</p>\n\n<p>We will review applications and nominations in early February, and plan to notify all submittors and nominees by email later in the month.</p>\n\n<p><em>We look forward to your HashiCorp Ambassador submissions!
