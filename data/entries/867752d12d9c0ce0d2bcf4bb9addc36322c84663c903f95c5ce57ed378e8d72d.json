Yet people get around the law via cow- or herd-shares, in which they purchase a share of an animal or herd and can use milk from the animals for personal use.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935091#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935091&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"867752d12d9c0ce0d2bcf4bb9addc36322c84663c903f95c5ce57ed378e8d72d","category":"Tech"}
