Easy to maneuver, yet still stable in notoriously loose conditions. Lightweight &amp; light feeling, even with those massive tires. Not exceptionally progressive geometry these days, but still ahead of its time to create a versatile ride from snow to soft leaves to mud to summer sand dunes…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Borealis Crestone, a benchmark lightweight carbon fat bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_complete.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_complete-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Borealis Crestone fatbike Review: benchmark lightweight carbon fat bike long-term test, complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_complete-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_complete-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_complete-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_complete-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_complete-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_complete-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_complete.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption>(All Photos/ Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Borealis Crestone first debuted all the way back in<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ib15-borealis-adds-carbon-crestone-rides-the-flume-with-aluminum-fat-bikes/\"> fall 2015</a>. And yes, we’re about to write thousands of words and share tons of photos of a bike that has been virtually unchanged in more than 8 years. You want to know why? Because it is still a great bike, and still getting better with the addition of modern fat bike tires and suspension.

And with the full carbon Borealis fork, it’s 1375g lighter at 12.8kg (28.2lb). Sure that’s no ultralight compared to a carbon XC hardtail, but with tires that easily range from 1200-1700g a piece and tubes that weigh up to 450g, it’s pretty light.

But its secret, is that fat bikes are weird. And the loose terrain you ride them in with heavy tires is not normal. That “quicker” handling helps counteract the slow steering you get from 2 kilos of front tire &amp; tube. And Borealis balances it at the other end with long 455mm chainstays, that help keep the bike moving in a straight line for stability, when grip is lacking. It’s much more common to spin out your rear wheel on a fat bike than a normal hardtail. And I can’t remember sliding many snowy freeride downhills where I wouldn’t have killed for more stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_geometry.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_geometry-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Borealis Crestone fatbike Review: benchmark lightweight carbon fat bike long-term test, proven geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_geometry-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_geometry-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_geometry-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_geometry-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_geometry-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_geometry-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_geometry.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and swapping in the 120mm fork… at 30% sag, it does slacken the head angle by 1°, raise the effective Stack by 7mm, and effectively shorten Reach by 11mm.

And with zero offset MTB posts, you can usually slide the saddle a bit forward for a steeper ‘virtual’ seat angle and improved climbing efficiency, if you want. The trick here though, is that you actually do a lot of seated pedaling to power through loose terrain on a fat bike, so you don’t actually want quite as steep a seat angle as you’d expect on a modern trail bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, good fatbike geometry is weird. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>But what tires and what wheel size should you get?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_all-conditions.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_all-conditions-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Borealis Crestone fatbike Review: benchmark lightweight carbon fat bike long-term test, all-season\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_all-conditions-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_all-conditions-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_all-conditions-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_all-conditions-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_all-conditions-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_all-conditions-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_all-conditions.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is genuinely the biggest dilemma in the fat bike debate. And really, we’re gonna have to truly answer it in a separate article. But tires and wheel diameter really make the fatbiking experience (<em>as does wildly-low tire pressure</em>). Make the wrong choice in wheel diameter (<em>hint: 26″is dead</em>) and your fat bike will just feel a bit slower than it already is. But get the wrong tires for the conditions you ride. And you genuinely won’t be having a good time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_fresh-groomed-corduroy.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_fresh-groomed-corduroy-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Borealis Crestone fatbike Review: benchmark lightweight carbon fat bike long-term test, fresh groomed corduroy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_fresh-groomed-corduroy-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_fresh-groomed-corduroy-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_fresh-groomed-corduroy-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_fresh-groomed-corduroy-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_fresh-groomed-corduroy-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_fresh-groomed-corduroy-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_fresh-groomed-corduroy.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In ultra-abbreviated fashion. Fork out the money for lighter, more supple tires if you are really riding in snow. If you ride hardpacked or groomed trails – whether dirt or snow – low-profile treads do roll noticeably quicker.

The alloy Sun Ringlé pair sells today for $420. The difference in weight of a 26″ wheelset is 614g for the pair.

All of last winter and sometime this past summer, I tested the Borealis Crestone. It’s maybe my 4th or 5th fat bike, with a lot of time spent on a couple alloy Duratec expedition Big Paws, faster Fat Jacks, and the more trail-oriented Cannondale Fat CAAD over the past few years. All with rigid forks. The majority of my fat bike riding is on hard frozen surfaces and ice. But I also hunt fresh powder to ride and extend into the melting snow of spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last winter I didn’t get as much packed snow as I wished for. But luckily, we live in a mountain pass, so I still got in 5-600km of snowy trails over 25 separate rides. Those snow freeride rides often don’t rack up the kilometers very fast! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, in summer I grabbed the chance to ride sandy beaches on the Baltic Sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Borealis Crestone fat bike’s first rides</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_snowy-road-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_snowy-road-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Borealis Crestone fatbike Review: benchmark lightweight carbon fat bike long-term test, snowy road\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_snowy-road-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_snowy-road-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_snowy-road-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_snowy-road-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_snowy-road-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_snowy-road-2048x1229.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My first rides were on the original setup that I obtained from Borealis, with a price-conscious mechanical GX build and a rigid carbon fork. Think a roughly $2500 build with a dropper and alloy wheels. The dropper is optional, but obviously a pretty key feature to have on a fat bike. Like any trail bike, it is nice not to stop on the top of a hill and just fly down the trail. BUT with fat bikes specifically, I found it very useful when you need to get back on your bike after crashing in deep snow, passing a non-rideable obstacle, or just simply starting to pedal in steep uphill in deep, uneven snow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I don’t love the KS Lev iS dropper, as you have to press the remote pretty hard/far to get the “action”.

I felt I was flying on flats. And I even enjoyed going uphill, as well. Speed was especially pronounced with the larger diameter 27.5 wheels and narrower 3.8-4″ tires. The combination of light carbon frame, rigid carbon fork &amp; oversized carbon handlebar felt really responsive. It’s really a great setup riding smoother packed snowy roads and groomed snow trails.

Laying down fresh tracks. I can ride in areas that are nearly unrideable in summer. Or simply unpleasantly bumpy due to so many roots &amp; rocks. Once we get that first 30cm of snow and it packs down &amp; freezes, all terrain smooths out. And then, riding in the next couple centimeters of fresh powder is a real joy. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Upgrading for trails to the Manitou Mastodon 120mm suspension fork</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_Manitou-Mastodon-120mm-fork-upgrade.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_Manitou-Mastodon-120mm-fork-upgrade-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Borealis Crestone fatbike Review: benchmark lightweight carbon fat bike long-term test, 120mm Manitou Mastodon Pro suspension fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_Manitou-Mastodon-120mm-fork-upgrade-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_Manitou-Mastodon-120mm-fork-upgrade-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_Manitou-Mastodon-120mm-fork-upgrade-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_Manitou-Mastodon-120mm-fork-upgrade-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_Manitou-Mastodon-120mm-fork-upgrade-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_Manitou-Mastodon-120mm-fork-upgrade.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, for such path-free riding or fat freeride trail riding, the super stiff carbon fork is less than ideal paired to the also stiff frame. Riding full-tilt downhill is possible. But it lacked some of the fun. And my upper body quickly tired from all the impacts. So, I swapped in suspension with the 120mm <a href=\"https://hayesbicycle.com/collections/mastodon/products/my21mastodonpro_z\" target=\"_blank\">gen 2 Manitou Mastodon Pro</a> fork. At the same time as swapping the fork, I also exchanged the 35mm Borealis bars for a straighter 31.6mm flat Beast carbon bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_4-5psi.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_4-5psi-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Borealis Crestone fatbike Review: benchmark lightweight carbon fat bike long-term test, low pressure\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_4-5psi-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_4-5psi-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_4-5psi-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_4-5psi-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_4-5psi-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_4-5psi.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The swap made the Crestone a lot more fun as a winter trail bike.

Since I ride this bike only with platform pedals, I can ‘cheat’ my  feet a bit closer together. But the wide stance is certainly noticeable after swapping from my enduro bike in the autumn. And I don’t feel like I will do too many 100km rides on the Crestone.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_off-piste.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_off-piste-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"Borealis Crestone fatbike Review: benchmark lightweight carbon fat bike long-term test, off-piste\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_off-piste-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_off-piste-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_off-piste-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_off-piste-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_off-piste-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_off-piste.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, it is necessary to mention that uphill pedaling efficacy was better with the fully rigid original setup. A suspension fork really depends on individual taste. For off-road fun trail riding I would certainly recommend the suspension fork. But for ultra longer snowy-packed road rides, I would go with the Borealis rigid fork. The one major benefit of the Manitou Mastodon fork though is that it is (relatively easily) internally adjustable down to 80mm of travel, which would be a happy medium compromise for many fat bike riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bike-to-ski</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Borealis Crestone fatbike Review: benchmark lightweight carbon fat bike long-term test, bike-to-ski\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrapping up last winter, we played with using the fatbike as a commuter bike to go skiing, too. Ride to the local lift, pedal to groomed XC ski tracks, or just getting up to a good starting point for backcountry skiing. It seemed to me like a really cool idea. So with some versatile 4″ Cake Eaters, I strapped my skialp skis to my backpack and pedaled up to higher elevation to reach deep skiable snow. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-parked.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-parked-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Borealis Crestone fatbike Review: benchmark lightweight carbon fat bike long-term test, bike-to-ski parking\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-parked-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-parked-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-parked-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-parked-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-parked-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-parked-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Borealis-Crestone-fatbike-Review_benchmark-lightweight-carbon-fat-bike-long-term-test_bike-to-ski-parked.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It involved a little bit of ski+pack shuffling to make it work. And pedaling up was slow going. Mostly in the granny gear. And we just locked the fat bikes up deep in the snowy woods when we couldn’t pedal any further. But it worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll dial it in this winter for a bit more efficiency, and probably some longer approach rides.

In all types of conditions. Yes, we’d love to see what Borealis could do by modernizing the bike with slightly longer, slightly slacker geometry, and maybe even an flip-chip at the dropout to give you the option for shorter summer chainstays.
