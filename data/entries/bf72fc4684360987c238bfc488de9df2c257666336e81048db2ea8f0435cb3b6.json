Think knee and elbow pads, chest guards, and all kinds of body armor all focused on railing berms rather than hitting apexes on Italian roads. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/tag/q36-5/\"><span>Q36.5</span></a><span> has a new solution to road bike protection that they call Gridskin technology, or GRDXKN in marketing speak. This new layer is said to “demonstrate five times the abrasion resistance compared to an untreated fabric” compared to an untreated fabric. Further, Q36.5 claims protection at up to 60 mph (100 km/h). </span><span>Heady claims.</span></p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/q36.5-gridskin-mens-jersey-navy-blue-jersey-detail.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"q36.5-gridskin-men's-jersey-navy-blue-jersey-detail\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1350\" /><figcaption>Gridskin fabric is unique in that it adds dimension and complexity to fabrics that are usually as close to the skin as possible.

Q36.5 the material’s structure is said to offer some shock absorption as well when compared to standard lycra-based cycling apparel. Furthermore, the brand says the structure was designed such that it smooths airflow over the fabric. </span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/q36.5-gridskin-fabric-detail.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"q36.5-gridskin-fabric-detail\" width=\"1080\" height=\"960\" /><figcaption>A zoomed-in detail image of what Gridskin looks like. It certainly looks more complicated than most other cycling apparel.

All told, the material is said to add 20 g to a pair of bib shorts or a jersey.</span></p>\n<p><span>Gridskin will be used on a jersey and a pair of bib shorts. The Q36.5 Grid Skin Short Sleeve Jersey utilizes their technology along the shoulders and upper back that when worn, makes it almost look like you’re wearing a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qWFSBqAxR4\"><span>Jerry Seinfeld puffy shirt</span></a><span>. The Grid Skin Jersey is available in men’s and women’s cuts.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Q36.5-womens-grid-skin-jersey-in-black-side-profile.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Q36.5-women's-grid-skin-jersey-in-black-side-profile\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1350\" /><figcaption>Grid Skin jerseys and bib shorts are available in both men’s and women’s specific cuts.

(Photo: Q36.5)</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>The Q36.5 Grid Skin Bib Shorts feature the same Gridskin fabric along the hip of the bib short before fading around the cuff at the bottom of the leg. This is paired with Q36.5’s now-characteristic silver pinstriping along the back for added support, with men’s and women’s cuts available.  </span></p>\n<p><span>This isn’t the first time Q36.5 has claimed their fabrics offer some sort of additional benefit. The outer fabric panels of their bibs often have a ‘Y’ pattern that increases in density from the torso to the bottom of the leg, and the shoulders on many of their jerseys are perforated in a way that Q36.5 claims has aero benefits. But this is the first time they’ve used a material that claims so many things at once. </span></p>\n<p>If the claims are true, it will be interesting to see whether the aero benefits are enough for <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/01/q36-5-unveils-new-kits-bikes-for-debut-season/\" target=\"_blank\">the Doug Ryder-led Q36.5 racing team</a> to use them. One also wonders if technology focused on abrasion resistance will proliferate to other cycling apparel brands. Either way, any amount of protection for apparel that aims to be comfortable on warm-weather rides is a worthwhile development.</p>\n<p><span>We’ve requested a Q36.5 Grid Skin jersey and bib shorts for review, though hopefully, we won’t put it to the test as we have with our </span><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/03/cannondale-dynam-helmet-review/\"><span>Cannondale Dynam helmet review</span></a><span>.
