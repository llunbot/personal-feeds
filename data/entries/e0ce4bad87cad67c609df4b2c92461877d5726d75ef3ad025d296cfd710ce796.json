Specialized bills the tyre as an endurance all-road tyre, built for durability, all-weather traction and puncture protection, making it well-suited for the gruelling parcours of Paris-Roubaix. It sits in Specialized’s tyre range between its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-turbo-cotton-tyres-review\" target=\"_blank\">Turbo </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-roubaix-pro-tyres-review\" target=\"_blank\">Roubaix </a>tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you’d expect for a new tyre, it’s also tubeless-ready and comes in fashionably wide 28mm, 32mm and 35mm options. Unlike Specialized’s other road tyres, there’s no 23mm to 26mm tyre offered, reflecting the general move away from narrower tyres on road bikes. The 35mm tyre is also wider than the brand’s older tyre ranges, which typically top out at 30mm or 32mm width.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-tyre-pressure\">Bike tyre pressure guide: How to choose the best pressure</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/gallery_adv/are-wider-tyres-faster\">Are wider tyres faster?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-fit-tubeless-tyres\">How to fit tubeless tyres: Pro tips for fitting tubeless road, gravel and MTB tyres</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-cycling-tyres-the-best-tyres-for-all-occasions\">Best road bike tyres 2023: 10 of the best tyres for all occasions</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-winter-road-bike-tyres-stay-puncture-free\">Best winter road bike tyres 2023: Stay puncture-free</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Specialized emphasises the S-Works Mondo tyre’s suitability whatever the road surface, claiming that it delivers ‘race-like speed, insane tread life and next-level puncture protection’, making it a ‘go-anywhere, do-anything’ tyre option. The tyre has a slick central section with a fine herringbone tread on the shoulders though, so it might not be the best choice for an off-road excursion onto a muddy bridleway; Specialized bills it for tarmac, cobble and light gravel use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized claims that the tyre’s construction offers class-leading performance for an endurance tyre, with 11 per cent lower rolling resistance and 12 per cent better puncture protection, while being 5 per cent lighter than the competition. It’s also compatible with hookless rims, although Specialized’s own wheel rims are hooked and the brand emphasises the need to keep within the recommended rim pressures if your wheels are hookless.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-04-17-at-8.39.36-PM-970x647.png\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Mondo tyre construction\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-04-17-at-8.39.36-PM-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-04-17-at-8.39.36-PM-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-04-17-at-8.39.36-PM-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-04-17-at-8.39.36-PM-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-04-17-at-8.39.36-PM-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-04-17-at-8.39.36-PM-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-04-17-at-8.39.36-PM-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-04-17-at-8.39.36-PM.png 1091w\" /><figcaption>Specialized</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tyre’s dual-compound tread comprises Specialized’s Gripton T2 compound for the central tread, which it claims offers high speed and durability. The shoulders use Gripton T5, which Specialized says offers great wet and dry grip. Under-tread protection comes from Specialized’s Black Belt breaker. There’s also a new sidewall protection layer, that Specialized calls Grid Race, which is designed to be supple but provide abrasion and pinch flat resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a claimed 310g for a 28mm tyre, the S-Works Mondo is competitively lightweight. For comparison, we weighed the 28mm <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/continental-gp5000-as-tr-tyre-review\" target=\"_blank\">Continental GP5000 AS TR</a> tyre that we recently reviewed at 346g and the 28mm <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/vittoria-corsa-next-review\" target=\"_blank\">Vittoria Corsa N.Ext</a> at 302g. It’s also reasonably priced with an SRP of £55 as against the Conti’s £90-ish, although the Vittoria tyre costs the same as the S-Works Mondo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specialized S-Works Mondo tyre specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sizes available: </strong>28mm, 32mm, 35mm</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Weights:</strong> 310g (28mm), 330g (32mm), 360g (36mm)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SRP: </strong>£55</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">best tubeless road bike tyres</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/specialized-s-works-mondo-tyre\">New Specialized S-Works Mondo tyre is hookless-friendly and built for rougher roads</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e0ce4bad87cad67c609df4b2c92461877d5726d75ef3ad025d296cfd710ce796","category":"Cycling"}
