You still have time to donate to a good cause and get a chance to win your share of over $4,000 worth of swag (no purchase necessary to win).</p>\n<p>In the first week or so of the drive, nearly 180 readers have contributed almost $16,000 to either the <a href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/donate/\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> or <a href=\"http://www.childsplaycharity.org/\">Child's Play</a> as part of the charity drive (Child's Play is barely hanging on to a small donation lead at the moment). That's a long way off from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/ars-readers-gave-a-record-58000-in-2020-charity-drive/\">2020's record haul of over $58,000</a>, but there's still plenty of time until the Charity Drive wraps up on Thursday, January 2, 2025.</p>\n<p>That doesn't mean you should put your donation off, though. Do yourself and the charities involved a favor and give now while you're thinking about it.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/reminder-donate-to-win-swag-in-our-annual-charity-drive-sweepstakes-15/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/reminder-donate-to-win-swag-in-our-annual-charity-drive-sweepstakes-15/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"af078a94fc05b086b5e907301b1b8874cd07bb38657892daff334c3328d21a40","category":"Tech"}
