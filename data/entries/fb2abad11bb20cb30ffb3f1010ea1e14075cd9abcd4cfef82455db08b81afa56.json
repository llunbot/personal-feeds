The new feature allows users to manage all cookies and locally stored data generated by a particular website—regardless of whether they're cookies tagged to that site's domain or cookies placed <em>from</em> that site but belonging <em>to</em> a third-party domain, eg Facebook or Google.</p>\n<h2>Building on Total Cookie Protection</h2>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/firefox-91-cookie-partitoning-cartoon.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/firefox-91-cookie-partitoning-cartoon-640x320.png\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/firefox-91-cookie-partitoning-cartoon.png\">Mozilla isn't being delicate about which tech giant is first in its crosshairs.</a> (credit: Mozilla)</p></div>\n<p>The new feature builds and depends upon <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/firefox-86-brings-multiple-picture-in-picture-total-cookie-protection/\">Total Cookie Protection</a>, introduced in February with Firefox 86. Total Cookie Protection partitions cookies by the site that placed them, rather than the domain that owns them—which means that if a hypothetical third party we'll call \"Forkbook\" places tracking (or authentication) cookies on both <code>momscookies.com</code> and <code>grandmascookies.com</code>, it can't reliably tie the two together.</p>\n<p>Without cookie partitioning, a single Forkbook cookie would contain the site data for both <code>momscookies.com</code> and <code>grandmascookies.com</code>. With cookie partitioning, Forkbook must set two separate cookies—one for each site—and can't necessarily relate one to the other.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785945#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785945&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fb2abad11bb20cb30ffb3f1010ea1e14075cd9abcd4cfef82455db08b81afa56","category":"Tech"}
