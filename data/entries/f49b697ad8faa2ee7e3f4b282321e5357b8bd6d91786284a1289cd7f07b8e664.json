Hold on, I’m remembering my new Webco under the tree one year…man, that’s still a magical moment. Well, this holiday season, you can give the gift of a new bike too, by participating in the <a href=\"https://candaid.org/\">nationally recognized nonprofit</a>, Can’d Aid’s “Give One, Get One” campaign. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-all-the-bikes-.jpeg\"><img width=\"1170\" height=\"764\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-all-the-bikes-.jpeg\" alt=\"Can'd Aid GoGo Bike all the bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-all-the-bikes-.jpeg 1170w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-all-the-bikes--297x194.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-all-the-bikes--800x522.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-all-the-bikes--120x78.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-all-the-bikes--768x501.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The GoGo Campaign</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This campaign marks the celebration of their 10th year anniversary and 10,000 bikes donated. For every <a href=\"https://candaid.salsalabs.org/GOGO/index.html\">GoGo purchase</a> of a Can’d Aid 20″ bike, another bike is donated to a child in need. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We believe the best holiday gifts are those that encourage healthy habits and give back to the community,</em>” said Can’d Aid Founder and Executive Director Diana Ralston. “<em>Our GoGo program is a celebration of 10 years of giving and ten thousand bikes given away, and we hope it will be a great way for your family to celebrate the holidays in the true spirit of the season</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-hero-closer.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-hero-closer.jpeg\" alt=\"Can'd Aid GoGo Bike hero closer\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-hero-closer.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-hero-closer-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-hero-closer-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-hero-closer-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-hero-closer-768x576.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c. Can’d Aid</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a first or second-grader on the holiday list this year, the Can’d Aid Bike could be the perfect gift for that lil’ tike. The bike is said to be designed to keep your “kid-sized shredder” active and outside while supporting a child who doesn’t have access to resources like a new bike to keep active. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact is, regular physical activity, like bike riding, keeps kids healthy and supports confidence, emotional health, and well-being. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through Can’d Aid’s <a href=\"https://candaid.org/treads-trails/\">Treads and Trails</a> program, the organization has built and donated more than 10,000 bicycles to children across the US. Collaborating with<em> </em><a href=\"https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/50/3nddfbbnaynchm2ddgq2j2s78/4/b505047b8f0dbbe825d251eaac061d2293629079d6d96ed8fd1d95f9a9fadbd9\" target=\"_blank\">REEB Cycles</a>, at bike donation events, kids get to watch a demonstration by professional cyclists, like REEB Cycles rider Jeff Lenosky. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenoski is a world-class freeride, and trials mountain bike rider who’s also a longtime Treads and Trails ambassador. “Lenosky stokes kids’ enthusiasm for bike riding with a demonstration of safety, pro bike tricks, and a glimpse into what’s possible on wheels”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Can’d Aid Bike Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cand-Aid-GoGo-Bike-full-side.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\"
