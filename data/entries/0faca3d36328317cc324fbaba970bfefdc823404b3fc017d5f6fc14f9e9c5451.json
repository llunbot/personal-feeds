Originally he ran a factory that built bikes for brands such as Cervélo, Scott and Canyon, but in 2015 he decided to go it alone with the purchase of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/not-all-carbon-bikes-are-created-equal-inside-factors-taiwanese-hq\" target=\"_blank\">Factor Bikes</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Rob discusses how the bike industry really works, why things are so expensive, what progress lies in store, and what he believes is one of the fastest bikes ever made – and it came out several decades ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview begins at 10:42.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/cyclist-magazine-podcast/episodes/107-factor-bikes-owner-rob-gitelis\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 107 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know <em>Cyclist</em> is also stunning monthly magazine?
