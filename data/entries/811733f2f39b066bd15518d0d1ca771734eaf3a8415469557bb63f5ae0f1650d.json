Though it was more like a supercharged <a href=\"https://amzn.to/43Wl4vw\" target=\"_blank\">Mac mini</a> than a downsized Mac Pro, its M1 Max and M1 Ultra processors were fantastic performers, and they were much more energy-efficient than the one in the most recent Intel Mac Pro, too.</p>\n<p>Apple is releasing the <a href=\"https://howl.me/cjWpXz3whiU\" target=\"_blank\">M2 version</a> of the Mac Studio this week, and even though it's being launched alongside <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/this-is-the-new-apple-silicon-mac-pro/\">a brand-new Mac Pro</a>, it still might be Apple's most compelling professional desktop. That's partly because the new Studio is even faster than the old one—Apple sent us a fully enabled M2 Ultra model with 128GB of RAM—and partly because Apple Silicon Macs are designed in ways that make Mac Pro-style expandability and modularity impossible.</p>\n<p>There is probably still a tiny audience for the redesigned Mac Pro, people who still use macOS and still use internal PCI Express expansion cards that aren't GPUs; it should also be relatively easy to add gobs of cheap, fast internal storage, a kind of upgrade the Mac Studio is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/explaining-the-mac-studios-removable-ssds-and-why-you-cant-just-swap-them-out/\">still frustratingly incapable of</a>. There's also a bit of awkward pricing overlap with the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/m2-pro-mac-mini-review-apples-goldilocks-desktop-for-semi-professionals/\">high-end M2 Pro Mac mini</a> that didn't exist last year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946919#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946919&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"811733f2f39b066bd15518d0d1ca771734eaf3a8415469557bb63f5ae0f1650d","category":"Tech"}
