{"title":"Qualcomm Is Trying to Acquire Intel","link":"https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/qualcomm-approached-intel-about-a-takeover-in-recent-days-fa114f9d","date":1726878970000,"content":"\n<p>Lauren Thomas, Laura Cooper, and Asa Fitch, reporting for The Wall Street Journal (<a href=\"https://apple.news/Al2lwo342RdS-1GKByz83sg\">News+</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chip giant Qualcomm made a takeover approach to rival Intel in\nrecent days, according to people familiar with the matter, in what\nwould be one of the largest and most consequential deals in recent\nyears. A deal for Intel, which has a market value of roughly $90\nbillion, would come as the chip maker has been suffering through\none of the most significant crises in its five-decade history.</p>\n\n<p>A deal is far from certain, the people cautioned. Even if Intel is\nreceptive, a deal of that size is all but certain to attract\nantitrust scrutiny, though it is also possible it could be seen as\nan opportunity to strengthen the U.S.’s competitive edge in chips.\nTo get the deal done, Qualcomm could intend to sell assets or\nparts of Intel to other buyers.</p>\n\n<p>Intel — once the world’s most valuable chip company — had seen\nits shares drop roughly 60% so far this year before The Wall\nStreet Journal reported on the approach. As recently as 2020, the\ncompany had a market value above $290 billion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you’d told me even just 10 years ago that one of two would acquire the other in 2024, I’d have lost my shirt betting it would be Intel acquiring Qualcomm, not the other way around. What an ignominious demise this would be for the company that put the <em>silicon</em> in Silicon Valley. But here we are.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/20/qualcom-intel-wsj\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"160e8aa8d80c59fa545918ae1446986d94d09fb8c51693deaa7507b10af787f3","category":"Tech"}
