Lilly Wachowski went so far as to <a href=\"https://www.timescolonist.com/wachowskis-unfazed-by-negativity-ahead-of-jupiter-ascending-launch-1.1751638\">call the prospect</a> \"a particularly repelling idea in these times\" in a 2015 interview—a sharp critique of Hollywood's preference for sequels, reboots, and adaptations.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Warner Bros. officially announced the fourth film in August 2019. Lana Wachowski signed on to direct and co-write the film with novelist David Mitchell (<em>Cloud Atlas</em>) and Aleksandar Hemon (<em>Sense8</em>). Lilly Wachowski gave the project her blessing but declined to be involved, partly because she was busy with Showtime's <em>Work in Progress</em>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817224#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817224&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"baf2263f803d449ce29ac4d0ab37202bd4f55687a464bb78ebc96f31a0656fe3","category":"Tech"}
