Try as I might, I can’t help but keep things simple. A bike is a tool for a job and in my opinion doesn’t need more than what’s absolutely necessary. But I still wanted to show that aluminium can be part of the mix.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bespoked handmade bike show in Manchester is dominated by elegant steel tubes and outlandish design quirks, but Stout is flying the flag for no-fuss aluminium frames. Operating out of a modest workshop in the Scottish Borders, armed with a jig, a mill, a welder and little else, he builds bikes for the love of it, using what he sees as a criminally overlooked material.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-02-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Meet the maker Stout Cycles\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-02-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-02-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-02-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-02-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-02-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-02-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-02-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-02-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-02.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Alex Wright/Teneight</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘In working with aluminium I’ve found that getting the welding right is the most challenging aspect,’ Stout tells <em>Cyclist</em>. ‘The material requires a bigger torch than steel, so there’s less space to manoeuvre around tight mitres, which sometimes leads to frustration.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>‘On the flip side, I like it as a material. I find it cleaner and easier to work with than steel. Some people say it’s trickier, but it’s more that it’s different – you just have to change your approach and processes.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-03-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Meet the maker Stout Cycles\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-03-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-03-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-03-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-03-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-03-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-03-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-03-1140x1710.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-03.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Russell Stout started out making steel adventure bikes with Shand Cycles, but his ambition to build aluminium race bikes inspired him to set out on his own.</figcaption><figcaption>Alex Wright/Teneight</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Listening to Stout talk, you could be forgiven for assuming Stout Cycles isn’t his first rodeo. And you’d be correct. In 2010 he sold his stake in a communications design agency after realising he wanted to work with his hands. A lifelong cyclist, this led him to a conversation with fellow Scotsman and framebuilder Steven Shand. Within six months the two had set up steel adventure bike brand Shand Cycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward ten years, and with Shand Cycles sold, Stout set up a small workshop at home with one goal: to build high-quality aluminium frames.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+8\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-8-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘We were building steel bikes at Shand, but I always had a hankering to make some simple, lightweight, aluminium race bikes,’ Stout says. ‘It’s a very different material, but I really like its properties. The more I work with it, the more I appreciate things like the scope to design CNC parts – it’s all much easier and more cost-effective than with steel or titanium.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is Hrok, meaning ‘rook’ or ‘crow’ in Old Norse. This is Stout’s aluminium framebuilding passion project, falling under the wider Stout Cycles umbrella, along with his custom bike painting business Big Bada-Boom.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-04-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Meet the maker Stout Cycles\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-04-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-04-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-04-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-04-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-04-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-04-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-04-1140x1710.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/meet-the-maker-stout-cycles-04.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Alex Wright/Teneight</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A veteran of the Scottish cross scene and no stranger to an ultra-distance event, Stout’s functional Hrok bikes are a reflection of his riding style and local trails, blending simplicity, durability and aesthetic appeal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’re really spoiled for some amazing places to ride here [in the Borders],’ he says. ‘And it all feeds into the bikes I like to make.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At present, the Hrok range includes just two bikes: a drop-bar off-road tourer and this cyclocross racer made from Dedacciai 7005 T6 aluminium tubing and with 40mm tyre clearance. The icing on the cake is the attention-grabbing metallic paintjob with pink accents courtesy of the seat clamp and bar tape.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/medusa-cycles-pete-skelton\">Meet the maker: Pete Skelton of Medusa Cycles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/havren-frameworks-chris-roberts\">Meet the maker: Chris Roberts of Havren Frameworks</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/curve-titanosaur\">Meet the maker: Curve’s new massive bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>In the frame</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The 7005 tubing has already been hardened,’ says Stout, ‘so unlike 5000 and 6000 series grades, it doesn’t strictly require heat treating after welding.
