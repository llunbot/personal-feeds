The new software will also ship on the new <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/apple-intros-14-and-16-inch-macbook-pros-with-display-notches-m1-pro-and-m1-max/\">14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros</a> Apple is releasing next week.</p>\n<p>Compared to the major redesign Apple gave macOS last year with <a href=\"http://v\">Big Sur</a>, Monterey is a low-key release, not unlike <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/ios-15-review-apple-turns-its-focus-to-the-little-things/\">iOS 15</a>. One of the major new features is Shortcuts support, which originally appeared in iOS 12 back in 2018. Shortcuts doesn't immediately replace Automator or AppleScript, but it will most likely become the go-to way to automate complex tasks on Macs. Other major features include Universal Control, which allows you to use a Mac's keyboard and trackpad to seamlessly control multiple Macs or iPads, as well as a Focus mode that adds more granularity to the Do Not Disturb feature.</p>\n<p>Monterey will run on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, though it won't run on everything that currently supports macOS Big Sur. The full support list drops a handful of 2013 and 2014-model Intel Macs, as well as the first iteration of the 12-inch MacBook from 2015:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804948#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804948&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ae27656bec38d1c4fcfd87e469b9a3ad542d85da951bd0a06266ee38e98f43ab","category":"Tech"}
