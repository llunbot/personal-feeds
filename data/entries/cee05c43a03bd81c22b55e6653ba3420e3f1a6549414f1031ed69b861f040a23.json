The model shown is a seventh-generation iPod nano, which was released in 2012.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>This new Apple ad is  <a href=\"https://t.co/WVpxaDSpiz\">pic.twitter.com/WVpxaDSpiz</a></p>— Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1787891307135881533?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 7, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/07/27/apple-removes-ipod-nano-ipod-shuffle/\">discontinued the iPod nano</a> in 2017, and this is the first time we have seen the device appear in an ad in quite some time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEven the 11-inch iPad Pro is now thinner than the iPod nano, as Apple explains:<blockquote>The new iPad Pro — the thinnest Apple product ever — features a stunningly thin and light design, taking portability to a whole new level. The 11-inch model is just 5.3 mm thin, and the 13-inch model is even thinner at a striking 5.1 mm, while both models are just as strong as the previous design. The 11-inch model weighs less than a pound, and the 13-inch model is nearly a quarter pound lighter than its predecessor — allowing pro users to extend their workflows in new ways and in more places.</blockquote>The new iPad Pro models are available to order now and launch May 15.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/\">Apple Ads</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/ipod-nano-appears-in-new-ipad-pro-ad/\">iPod Nano Makes Rare Appearance in Apple Ad for Thinner iPad Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipod-nano-makes-rare-appearance-in-apple-ad-for-thinner-ipad-pro.2425771/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cee05c43a03bd81c22b55e6653ba3420e3f1a6549414f1031ed69b861f040a23","category":"Apple"}
