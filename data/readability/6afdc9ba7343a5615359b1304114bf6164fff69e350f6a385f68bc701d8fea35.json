If so, you’ve got until the end of today to answer ENVE’s <a href=\"https://atb.life/\">open casting call</a> for a one-of-a-kind, bike-powered adventure.</p><p>Five lucky contestants will get to take part in the ultimate all-terrain adventure bicycling reality show. ENVE has billed it as an “ATB-themed reality TV Game show” and based on the retro website and partnership with fashion designer, influencer, and self-proclaimed “alt cycling mogul” <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2018/02/18/nahbs-2018-ultraromance-loves-new-666mm-wide-drop-bars-sklar-nutmegger-bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ronnie Ronmance, Ultranicus</a>, the show has the potential to be both quirky and entertaining. For the five cyclists selected, they will get to experience what ENVE’s got in store from the saddle of a customized ATB machine (that’s All Terrain Bicycle, sort of the anti-gravel nomenclature).</p><h2>Step 1: Build the ultimate ATB — but choose wisely</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26124637/crust-bombora-frame.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26124637/crust-bombora-frame.jpg\" alt=\"Crust bombora frame\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26124637/crust-bombora-frame.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26124637/crust-bombora-frame-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26124637/crust-bombora-frame-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26124637/crust-bombora-frame-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26124637/crust-bombora-frame-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26124637/crust-bombora-frame.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26124637/crust-bombora-frame.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26124637/crust-bombora-frame-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26124637/crust-bombora-frame-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26124637/crust-bombora-frame-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/26124637/crust-bombora-frame-768x512.jpg 768w\"></a></p><p>The five contestants will start with the same base kit consisting of the ENVE ATB Kit, Crust Bombora ATB Edition frame, Ultradynamico ATB tireset, and SRAM ATB groupset. From there, the sky is the limit on spec’ing out the final build. <a href=\"https://www.enve.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ENVE</a> will undoubtedly be eyeing this reality TV show as a chance to show off its latest and greatest tech.</p><p>But participants are warned that every decision they make will have the potential for consequences out on course. Drop bar vs. flat bar? Clipless vs. flat pedals? The best option might depend on your riding style and what you think the undisclosed route might throw your way.</p><h2>Step 2: Tackle the insanely rugged cyclo-overlanding route</h2><p>Once the builds are complete, the five challengers will be flown to a secret, remote location somewhere in North America. Details are thin on where the “undisclosed insanely rugged location” might be or what the “World’s Most Challenging ATB route ever imagined” might entail, though it seems safe to guess that it’s going to go well beyond simply cranking through the gears.</p><p>Of the details that are provided, contestants can expect a 73-mile route with 11,345 feet of elevation gain. Add to that the promised hike-a-bikes, river crossings, wayfinding, rope bridges, orienteering, creek dousings, and tree climbings, and it begins to sound like some diabolical mix of all-terrain bicycling and Survivorman.</p><p>In fact, packing for the time out on course will be part of the challenge as contestants will need to bring their own bags, gear, and nutrition as there is no support along the way. If any of the five contestants finish the route in under 18 hours, the prize (besides bragging rights) will be to take their dream ATB build, home for keeps.</p><h2>Got Grit?

Can you fish with your bare hands?)
