The device was non-functional when it was purchased, but was able to boot when the hard drive flex cable was replaced.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ipod-3g-dvt.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" />\r<br />\nThe iPod runs a prototype version of iPodOS 2.0, and one of the games is \"Stacker.\" Stacker works a lot like Tetris, where the Tetris pieces are moved from left to right using the scroll wheel. Pieces fall when the middle button is pressed, and the idea is to clear more lines at once to rack up points.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are other games on the iPod, and all of them have placeholder non-release names, including Block0, Chopper, and Klondike. There's also a battery testing playlist on the device that has classical songs that play in a loop, suggesting Apple used this iPod to test the battery life of the third-generation iPod before it was released.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ipod-battery-testing-prototype.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1497\" />\r<br />\nAppleDemoYT says that he asked \"iPod godfather\" Tony Fadell why the Stacker game was not released, and Fadell said that it was because games were added \"with a later software release.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple did add several games to the iPod 3G over time, including Brick, Solitaire, Parachute, and Music Quiz. In 2006, Apple released games through the iTunes Store that people could purchase for later versions of the iPod, including an official version of Tetris.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther games available through the iTunes Store included Bejeweled, Mini Golf, Mahjong, Zuma, Cubis 2, and Pac-Man, all of which pre-dated the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/prototypes/\">Prototypes</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/24/ipod-prototype-tetris-clone/\">Prototype iPod Features Apple-Designed Tetris Clone Called 'Stacker'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/prototype-ipod-features-apple-designed-tetris-clone-called-stacker.2427287/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3a5037ba2450c4fe2520dc68a207f2856260657c36162b7d01de53bfb587140f","category":"Apple"}
