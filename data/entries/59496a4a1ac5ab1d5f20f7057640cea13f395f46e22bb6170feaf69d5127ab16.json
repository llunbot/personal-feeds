These HSAs and FSAs allow for coverage of health-related expenses at discount rates. They also play a big part in preventative care that can help treat or prevent chronic conditions, like obesity and diabetes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Zwift-x-Truemed-HSAFSA-Savings-big-discount-jpeg-e1732315787282.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"966\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Zwift-x-Truemed-HSAFSA-Savings-big-discount-jpeg-e1732315787282.webp\" alt=\"Zwift x Truemed HSA:FSA Savings big discount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Zwift-x-Truemed-HSAFSA-Savings-big-discount-jpeg-e1732315787282.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Zwift-x-Truemed-HSAFSA-Savings-big-discount-jpeg-e1732315787282-297x224.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Zwift-x-Truemed-HSAFSA-Savings-big-discount-jpeg-e1732315787282-120x91.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Zwift-x-Truemed-HSAFSA-Savings-big-discount-jpeg-e1732315787282-768x580.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Buy stuff, save money!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Empowering Consumers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Truemed helps consumers prioritize their health by streamlining processes to invest in and save on health products and services. Mix that with Zwift’s unique community-driven fitness platform, and this could be something great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>HSA/FSA funds substantially expand access to root cause interventions. The biggest barrier to using our HSA and FSA savings is not consumers’ commitment to leading healthier lives; it’s clarifying the HSA/FSA process and making it more intuitive</em>,” says Calley Means, co-founder of Truemed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Truemed’s integration with Zwift’s online store, qualified purchases are as easy as any other online shopping experience. Everything needed to qualify for a purchase with HSA/FSA funds can be done via the usual checkout process. It all happens in three easy steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Zwift-x-Truemed-HSAFSA-Savings-Payment-option-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"427\" height=\"246\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Zwift-x-Truemed-HSAFSA-Savings-Payment-option-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Zwift x Truemed HSA/FSA Savings Payment option\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Zwift-x-Truemed-HSAFSA-Savings-Payment-option-jpg.webp 427w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Zwift-x-Truemed-HSAFSA-Savings-Payment-option-297x171.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Zwift-x-Truemed-HSAFSA-Savings-Payment-option-120x69.webp 120w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo / Truemed)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>At checkout, consumers select the payment method “Pay with HSA/FSA funds”, which redirects to the Truemed website. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Then, take the brief health survey.
