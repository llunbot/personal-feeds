Libwebp is incorporated into just about every app, operating system, or other code library that renders webp images, most notably the Electron framework used in Chrome and many other apps that run on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, Google issued a <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4863\">security advisory</a> for what it said was a heap buffer overflow in WebP in Chrome. Google’s formal description, tracked as CVE-2023-4863, scoped the affected vendor as “Google” and the software affected as “Chrome,” even though any code that used libwebp was vulnerable. Critics warned that Google’s failure to note that thousands of other pieces of code were also vulnerable would <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/09/incomplete-disclosures-by-apple-and-google-create-huge-blindspot-for-0-day-hunters/\"> result in unnecessary delays</a> in patching the vulnerability, which allows attackers to execute malicious code when users do nothing more than view a booby-trapped webp image.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971345#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1971345&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dae834dab6264512cb46c427522e1f64adbf61be52c473a4be9f98e70f310737","category":"Tech"}
