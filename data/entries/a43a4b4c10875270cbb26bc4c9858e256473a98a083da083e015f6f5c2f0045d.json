The interface can be tailored to a specific vehicle model and automaker's brand identity, as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/\">previewed by Aston Martin and Porsche</a> in late December. Aston Martin said it would release its first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay in 2024, including a new model of its high-end DB12 sports car. Porsche did not provide a timeframe or specific details about its own plans.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Aston-Martin.jpeg\" width=\"980\" height=\"551\" /><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-2.jpeg\" width=\"1540\" height=\"854\" />\r<br />\nWhen first announcing next-generation CarPlay, Apple said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Polestar, Porsche, Renault, and Volvo. Beyond the addition of Aston Martin, it is unclear if this list has changed since that initial announcement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has not indicated if any next-generation CarPlay features will be made available in existing vehicles with classic CarPlay support. Apple said iOS 17.4 will be released in March, so perhaps additional details will be shared around then.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-next-generation-carplay/\">Apple Confirms Next-Generation CarPlay Launching in 2024, Reveals New Features in iOS 17.4 Beta</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-next-generation-carplay-launching-in-2024-reveals-new-features-in-ios-17-4-beta.2417478/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a43a4b4c10875270cbb26bc4c9858e256473a98a083da083e015f6f5c2f0045d","category":"Apple"}
