However, the Italian brand doesn’t produce a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country mountain bike</a>, so Pidcock has been riding an unbranded BMC Fourstroke full-suspension bike this year in his pursuit of an Olympic medal.</p>\n<p>Pidcock’s 29er has 100mm of travel damped by an SR Suntour Edge rear shock with a remote lockout. It’s fitted with an AXON-Werx34 Boost EQ SR Suntour fork that’s available with between 100mm and 120mm of travel. Most likely Pidcock’s bike is running the 100mm travel version of the AXON fork.</p>\n<p>The Fourstroke is equipped with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-xtr-m9100-everything-you-need-to-know/\">Shimano XTR</a> M9100 mechanical <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">mountain bike groupset</a> with a 12-speed cassette and single front
