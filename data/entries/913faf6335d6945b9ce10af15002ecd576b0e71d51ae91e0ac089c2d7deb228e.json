This has been achieved through a new built-in battery design that eliminates the need for a bulky battery compartment, according to the company. The lock features a new brushless motor, similar to those used in electric vehicles, enabling it to unlock in under 1.5 seconds, which could make it one of the fastest smart locks available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBuilt-in Wi-Fi eliminates the need for a separate bridge, while Matter-over-Thread and Bluetooth connectivity options are also included. The lock supports all major smart home platforms including Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home. Battery life is rated at six months per charge, with charging handled via an included two-meter magnetic cable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Magnetic-charging-on-door_Web.jpg\" width=\"5626\" height=\"3751\" />\r<br />\nThe European version requires replacing the entire lock cylinder and comes with three physical keys, while an upcoming US model will work as a retrofit solution similar to August smart locks. The lock can be controlled through multiple methods, including geofencing, via the smartphone app, or compatible smart home platforms, and it works with Nuki's existing accessories like key fobs and keypads.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe fifth-generation Nuki Smart Lock Ultra will be available in Europe this December for â‚¬349, with the US version planned for the second quarter of 2025.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nuki/\">Nuki</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/nuki-unveils-ultra-smart-lock-compact/\">Nuki Unveils Smart Lock Ultra With Faster Operation, Compact Design</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nuki-unveils-smart-lock-ultra-with-faster-operation-compact-design.2442741/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"913faf6335d6945b9ce10af15002ecd576b0e71d51ae91e0ac089c2d7deb228e","category":"Apple"}
