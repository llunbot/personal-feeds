In\nthese pages, we are offered a glimpse into his unique and\nwonderful mind. In a sense, this book is another tool from Steve — a resource for you, the reader, to spark the creativity that\nlives inside all of us and make your own mark on the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My link on this post is to a photo of the letter, via a little birdie at Disney — here’s <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/04/iger-disney-jobs-book-letter.text\">the text of the letter</a>, and <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110187006998782806\">my post on Mastodon</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Also, for everyone enjoying the book on the website, due to a regression in the latest version of Safari/WebKit, it works best in Chromium browser.
