That's according to a report this week from the Wall Street Journal (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-fail-to-catch-on-31f6ba4e\">WSJ</a>), citing internal data and claiming to detail the letdowns that led to hundreds of thousands of Stories gathering dust.</p>\n<p>Meta (then called Facebook) <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/ray-ban-stories-these-are-facebooks-first-mass-market-smart-glasses/?comments=1&amp;comments-page=1\">released Ray-Ban Stories</a> in 2021. The company's first mass-market smart glasses include a Snapdragon chip, two 5 MP front-facing cameras for snapping pictures or video, and speakers for listening to audio. Ray-Ban branding comes courtesy of the glasses' partnership with Ray-Ban parent company EssilorLuxottica (which also makes Oakleys and claims numerous luxury brands, including Burberry, Prada, Swarovski, and Tiffany &amp; Co.).</p>\n<p>But according to a February corporate document WSJ says it saw, under 10 percent of Ray-Ban Stories ever purchased are in active use. The publication reported that Meta sold 300,000 Stories, but there are just 27,000 monthly active users of the product.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958740#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958740&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"91a76d8ea8f25f23cc23b88a6785dc97735e93c79e2c3f055d472f61744dba7e","category":"Tech"}
