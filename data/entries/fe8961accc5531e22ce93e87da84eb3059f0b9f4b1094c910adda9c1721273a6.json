Lately, that has included a big push into the world of bikes. While you can find many name-brand bike products at their in-house bike shops, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rei-new-lifestyle-e-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">REI Co-Op Cycles brand </a>has slowly gained momentum as their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rei-co-op-cycles-adds-a-bargain-priced-fat-bike-capable-new-commuter-e-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">own private label</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-Op Cycles has offered a few different bikes now, including a few ebikes. But one thing that hasn’t been on the menu is a Co-Op branded eMTB. Until now. The new <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brprgearbikesgeneral[…]oduct%2F198759%2Fco-op-cycles-drt-e31-electric-mountain-bike\">DRT e3.1 electric mountain bike</a> is here (for members only initially), and it’s worth a look. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-35.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-35-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"REI Co-Op Cycles e3.1 eMTB angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-35-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-35-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-35-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-35-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-35-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-35-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-35-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the Co-Op Cycles formula, the DRT e3.1 is an aluminum-framed ebike aimed at the more affordable end of the spectrum. In this case, that still makes for a $4,999 ebike, but compared to other electric mountain bikes with a Bosch Performance Line CX drive system with the Smart System, the e3.1 is certainly among the most attainable. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bosch Drive System</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-07.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-07-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"REI Co-Op Cycles e3.1 eMTB downtube battery\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-07-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-07-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-07-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-07-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-07-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-07-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-24.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-24-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"REI Co-Op Cycles e3.1 eMTB class1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-24-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-24-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-24-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-24-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-24-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-24-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-24-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-06.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-06-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"REI Co-Op Cycles e3.1 eMTB motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-06-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-06-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-06-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-06-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-06-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-06-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the Bosch mid-drive motor with 85nm of torque and an assisted top speed of 20mph, the e3.1 is considered a Class 1 pedalec. It has no throttle, and requires pedaling to go forward. The frame’s downtube houses a lockable 625Wh battery which is charged through the port on the seat tube with the included 4A charger. With the 4A charger, you can charge to 100% in about 5.4hrs. Fully charged, the battery offers an estimated range of 20-48 miles. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-01.jpg\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-01.jpg\" alt=\"Bosch Smart system app\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-01.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-01-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-01-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-01-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-01-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/REI-e3.1-Co-Op-eMTB-electric-mountain-bike-review-01-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, we found out by accident that this bike includes the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bosch-ebike-systems-refreshes-smart-system-with-free-update/\" target=\"_blank\">Bosch Smart system </a>as it’s still not listed on any of the specs from REI.

Instead of a button or screen somewhere on the bike frame, you can turn the system on/off from the LED remote, see battery life, and cycle through the assist settings which are displayed with color-coded LEDs. For the e3.1, those modes include Eco, Sport, eMTB, and Turbo. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frame Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
