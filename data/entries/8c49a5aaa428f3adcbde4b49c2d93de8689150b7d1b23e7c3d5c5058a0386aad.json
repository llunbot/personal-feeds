For those looking for a more rigorous way of comparing various models, the folks over at the Large Model Systems Organization (LMSys) have <a href=\"https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena\">set up Chatbot Arena</a>, a platform for generating Elo-style rankings for LLMs based on a crowdsourced blind-testing website.</p>\n<p>Chatbot Arena users can enter any prompt they can think of into the site's form to see side-by-side responses from two randomly selected models. The identity of each model is initially hidden, and results are voided if the model reveals its identity in the response itself.</p>\n<p>The user then gets to pick which model provided what they judge to be the \"better\" result, with additional options for a \"tie\" or \"both are bad.\" Only after providing a pairwise ranking does the user get to see which models they were judging, though a separate \"side-by-side\" section of the site lets users pick two specific models to compare (without the ability to contribute a vote on the result).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990779#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990779&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8c49a5aaa428f3adcbde4b49c2d93de8689150b7d1b23e7c3d5c5058a0386aad","category":"Tech"}
