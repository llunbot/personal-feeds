The two patents cited in the case were later invalidated in a separate ruling from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter Apple appealed the initial 2020 ruling, it was able to point to the invalidation of the patents and get the initial award vacated by the federal appeals court. VirnetX attempted to escalate the patent invalidation case to the Supreme Court, but has been denied.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVirnetX is viewed as a patent holding company or \"patent troll\" that does not offer actual products or services. It generates revenue by suing technology companies that infringe on or license its patents.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Apple will not have to pay the $503 million from this particular trial, Apple did have to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/15/virnetx-wins-440-million-from-apple/\">shell out $440 million</a> in 2019 for violating VirnetX's communications security patents with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> and iMessage.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/virnetx/\">VirnetX</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent-lawsuits/\">Patent Lawsuits</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-wins-virnetx-503-million/\">U.S. Supreme Court Refuses to Hear VirnetX Patent Case, Saving Apple $503 Million</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-supreme-court-refuses-to-hear-virnetx-patent-case-saving-apple-503-million.2420013/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0d06340175d3bdc201a45d314473198dfb66eb96fc577b585805784010c9b41f","category":"Apple"}
