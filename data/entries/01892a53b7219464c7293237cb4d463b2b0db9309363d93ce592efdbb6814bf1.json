The sources also revealed that Apple is also considering equipping iPads with titanium-based metal chassis, but the high costs for doing so may not be economical at the moment.</blockquote>The claim follows a similar report <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/26/iphone-14-2022-pro-models-titanium-case/\">last month</a> suggesting high-end models in Apple's 2022 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> lineup will eschew the existing aluminum and stainless steel case design in favor of titanium, due to the latter's tougher strength and durability.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe rumors tally with Apple's recent investigations into the viability of titanium casings for its products, which include <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/26/apple-researching-titanium-macbook-casings/\">patents</a> related to the use of processed titanium with unique properties for future MacBooks, iPads, and iPhones.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCompared to stainless steel, titanium has a relatively high hardness that makes it more resistant to scratches, and its stiffness makes it durable enough to withstand bending. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, titanium's strength also makes it hard to etch, so Apple has developed a blasting, etching, and chemical process that can give titanium enclosures a high-gloss surface finish for a more attractive appearance. Apple has also been researching the use of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/23/titanium-anti-fingerprint-coatings-research/\">thin oxide surface coatings</a> which can reduce the appearance of oily fingerprints. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf the latest reports are accurate, it would be the first time Apple has used titanium in iPhonesâ€Œ and iPads. The company has used titanium as an optional casing material in recent Apple Watch models, and the physical <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a> is made of titanium, but the latest iPhones and iPads are made of stainless steel and/or aluminum.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini 5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/20/future-ipads-titanium-chassis/\">Future iPads May Feature Tough Titanium Alloy Chassis Designs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/future-ipads-may-feature-tough-titanium-alloy-chassis-designs.2308123/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YTy5QBScH-c:kAzxebxSwmc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YTy5QBScH-c:kAzxebxSwmc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/YTy5QBScH-c\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"01892a53b7219464c7293237cb4d463b2b0db9309363d93ce592efdbb6814bf1","category":"Apple"}
