This marks the first time that cosmetic procedures have been associated with an HIV outbreak, according to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7316a3.htm?s_cid=mm7316a3_w\">a detailed report of the outbreak investigation published today.</a></p>\n<p>Ars reported on the cluster last year when state health officials announced they were still identifying cases linked to the spa despite it being shut down in September 2018. But today's investigation report offers more insight into the unprecedented outbreak, which linked five people with HIV infections to the spa and spurred investigators to contact and test nearly 200 other spa clients. The report appears in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.</p>\n<p>The investigation began when a woman between the ages of 40 and 50 turned up positive on a rapid HIV test taken while she was traveling abroad in the summer of 2018. She had <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/whatishiv.html\">a stage 1 acute infection</a>. It was a result that was as dumbfounding as it was likely distressing. The woman had no clear risk factors for acquiring the infection: no injection drug use, no blood transfusions, and her current and only recent sexual partner tested negative. But, she did report getting a vampire facial in the spring of 2018 at a spa in Albuquerque called VIP Spa.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020165#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020165&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"93f4353ca3141d1e5dfbf95ec452f013d1ad6f96122565058752bef34fda1b16","category":"Tech"}
