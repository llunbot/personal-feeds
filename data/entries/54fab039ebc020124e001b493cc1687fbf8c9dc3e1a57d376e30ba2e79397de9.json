The bad news is that \"Shadow of the Erdtree\" will also be the <em>last</em> bit of DLC for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/putting-elden-rings-12-million-sales-in-context/\">FromSoftware's multimillion-selling action RPG</a>.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/694720699\">a wide-ranging interview with Chinese site Zhihu</a> (<a href=\"https://zhuanlan-zhihu-com.translate.goog/p/694720699?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp\">machine translation</a>), <em>Elden Ring</em> producer Hidetaka Miyazaki said \"Shadow of the Erdtree\" contains a lot of existing lore and content that was created for the original game but couldn't fit into the final package. Miyazaki said the team decided to release all of that unused content as one large DLC expansion, rather than multiple smaller bits, because \"if they were sold separately, the freedom of exploration and sense of adventure would be reduced.\"</p>\n<p>As for just how big the DLC will be, Miyazaki balked when the interviewer asked how long it would take players to complete. Miyazaki brought up memories of being called a liar after estimating in an earlier interview that the original game would only take about 30 hours of play to complete—crowdsourced game-length database HowLongToBeat puts the \"main story\" estimate <a href=\"https://howlongtobeat.com/game/68151\">closer to 60 hours</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021453#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021453&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"54fab039ebc020124e001b493cc1687fbf8c9dc3e1a57d376e30ba2e79397de9","category":"Tech"}
