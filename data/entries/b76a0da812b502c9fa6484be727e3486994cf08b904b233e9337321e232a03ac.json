Cycling is a team sport with individual winners, after all.</p>\n<p>Here’s how the 2021 Tour de France prize money was broken down.</p>\n<h2>Tour de France stage winner prize money</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Each stage winner gets €11,000.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thomas Samson / AFP via Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>The winner of every stage earned €11,000 in 2021, as well as a place on the podium at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>Second-place was worth half that, €5,500, while the rider in third raked in €2,800.</p>\n<p>In fact, every rider down to 20th place (€300) earned a share of the €28,650 on offer each day.</p>\n<p>Here’s the full breakdown for each individual stage classification.</p>\n<ol><li>€11,000</li>\n<li>€5,500</li>\n<li>€2,800</li>\n<li>€1,500</li>\n<li>€830</li>\n<li>€780</li>\n<li>€730</li>\n<li>€670</li>\n<li>€650</li>\n<li>€600</li>\n<li>€540</li>\n<li>€470</li>\n<li>€440</li>\n<li>€340</li>\n<li>€300</li>\n</ol><h2>Tour de France yellow jersey prize money</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tadej Pogačar took home €500,000 for winning the 2021 Tour de France.</span></figcaption><span> <i>ean Catuffe / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>If winning the stage also puts a rider into the yellow jersey, there was an extra €500 up for grabs, with the same prize on offer for each day a rider wore the maillot jaune.</p>\n<p>That, however, is small fry compared to the main prize pot for the general classification.</p>\n<p>The rider in the yellow jersey on the final podium in Paris in 2021 won €500,000, with Pogačar taking the spoils in this year’s race. The prize increased in 2016 and has remained the same since.</p>\n<p>Second place went to Jonas Vingegaard, netting him €200,000, with Richard Carapaz coming in third and taking home €100,000.</p>\n<p>Each rider from fourth to 19th receives increasingly smaller amounts, and everyone from 20th place to 160th is awarded €1,000 for completing the 3,414km race from Brest to Paris.</p>\n<p>Here’s a full breakdown of the prize money awarded to the ten overall fastest riders in 2021.</p>\n<ol><li>€500,000 (Tadej Pogačar)</li>\n<li>€200,000 (Jonas Vingegaard)</li>\n<li>€100,000 (Richard Carapaz)</li>\n<li>€70,000 (Ben O’Connor)</li>\n<li>€50,000 (Wilco Kelderman)</li>\n<li>€23,000 (Enric Mas)</li>\n<li>€11,500 (Alexey Lutsenko)</li>\n<li>€7,600 (Guillaume Martin)</li>\n<li>€4,500 (Peio Bilbao)</li>\n<li>€3,800 (Rigoberto Uran)</li>\n</ol><h2>Tour de France King of the Mountains prize money</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> In 2021, each day in the King of the Mountains jersey was worth €300.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Christine Poujolat / AFP via Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>A day in the King of the Mountains jersey was worth €300, while the top eight in the final mountains classification are recompensed at the end of the race.</p>\n<p>The overall winner received €25,000, while second place got €15,000.</p>\n<p>Pogačar also took the King of the Mountains prize in 2020, as well as securing overall victory and, by default, the best young rider.</p>\n<p>Here’s a full breakdown of the prize money awarded to the top eight finishers in the mountains classification in 2020.</p>\n<ol><li>€25,000 (Tadej Pogačar)</li>\n<li>€15,000 (Wouter Poels)</li>\n<li>€10,000 (Jonas Vingegaard)</li>\n<li>€4,000 (Wout van Aert)</li>\n<li>€3,500 (Nairo Quintana)</li>\n<li>€3,000 (Richard Carapaz)</li>\n<li>€2,500 (Ben O’Connor)</li>\n<li>€2,000 (Bauke Mollema)</li>\n</ol><h2>Tour de France climbs prize money</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s also prize money up for grabs at the top of each classified climb.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Broadway/ASO</i></span></div>\n<p>It’s not all about the final classification and the polka dot jersey – each <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tour-de-france-climbs/\">climb at the Tour de France</a> has a prize on offer at the top.</p>\n<p>For ‘hors categorie’ and first-category climbs, the first three over the summit earn prize money; on second-category ascents, it is the top two and on third and fourth-cat climbs it is just the first rider over.</p>\n<p>The 2021 Tour de France contained 27 climbs categorised as second category or above – with five in the top HC category. There were also 10 category three and 23 category four ascents.</p>\n<p>The five HC climbs were worth €800 to the first across, €450 to the second and €300 to the third.

In 2021, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange was awarded to the first rider at the top of the 2,408m port d’Envalira on stage 15. That added €5,000 to the kitty of Nairo Quintana this year.</p>\n<p>The Souvenir Jacques Goddet (€5,000) is offered to the first rider to reach the top of the Col du Tourmalet.

Even more so when you consider the €25,000 top prize for winning the points classification overall, which Sagan managed in seven of the eight years from 2012 to 2019.</p>\n<p>However, Irish sprinter Sam Bennett ended Sagan’s run in the green jersey in 2020 and Mark Cavendish made a triumphant return to green in 2021.</p>\n<p>The top eight in the final points classification all win prizes, 2021 looked as follows:</p>\n<ol><li>€25,000 (Mark Cavendish)</li>\n<li>€15,000 (Michael Matthews)</li>\n<li>€10,000 (Sonny Colbrelli)</li>\n<li>€4,000 (Jasper Philipsen)</li>\n<li>€3,500 (Wout van Aert)</li>\n<li>€3,000 (Matej Mohoric)</li>\n<li>€2,500 (Julian Alaphilippe)</li>\n<li>€2,000 (Tadej Pogačar)</li>\n</ol><p>That’s exactly in line with the mountains classification.</p>\n<p>Each intermediate sprint – one on each of the 20 road stages – was worth €1,500, €1,000 and €500 for the first three riders through.</p>\n<p>These prizes are often swallowed up by the breakaway, with the sprinters keeping their powder dry for the stage finishes – the prize money for the top 20 on each stage is detailed at the top of this article.</p>\n<h2>Tour de France young rider classification prize money</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 2021 youth classification is for riders born on or after 1 January 1996.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Michael Steele / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>A €300 prize is also up for grabs for each day in the white jersey of best young rider (in other words, for the 2021 race, those riders born on or after 1 January 1996).</p>\n<p>In addition, the highest-placed young rider on each stage can claim a €500 daily prize.</p>\n<p>The top four riders in the final young rider classification also win prizes.
