As well as offering smooth and accurate shifting, this also provides a generous spread of gears for hard climbs.</p>\n<p>Despite being billed as a road bike, the Triban RC 500 has clearance for 36mm wide tyres.

While this may not sound like a lot, it represents a 10 per cent difference in weight, which you can really feel on the bike.</p>\n<p>Like most bikes in this price range, the Contend 2 is fitted with a Shimano Claris groupset. There’s also a full complement of mudguard and rack mounts, so the Contend 2 is an ideal option for those looking for a true all-rounder that doesn’t compromise on ride quality.</p>\n<p>The bike we’ve reviewed here is the 2020 model, but the 2021 Contend 2 looks even better – at least on paper – thanks to larger 28mm tyres and different brakes.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/road/gear/category/bikes/road/product/giant-contend-2-review-51086/\">Read our full Giant Contend 2 (2020) review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Boardman SLR 8.6</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Boardman SLR 8.6 road bike\" title=\"Boardman SLR 8.6 - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The geometry of the Boardman SLR 8.6 is suited to commuting and longer rides.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£550 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Good gearing;

Unusually aggressive geometry makes the Laterite pacy for a bike of this ilk. Our tester found the Laterite 3 comfy enough for 100km-plus outings, even venturing off paved surfaces.</p>\n<p>Shimano’s nine-speed Sora groupset ensures efficient shifting. The addition of 34t and 32t sprockets makes climbing easier.</p>\n<p>The rim brakes are dependable but could eventually be upgraded, while the 25mm tyres could be switched for a wider pair (up to 32mm).</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/2021-pinnacle-laterite-3-review/\">Read our full Pinnacle Laterite 3 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Trek Domane AL 2</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Trek Domane AL 2 road bike\" title=\"Trek Domane AL 2 - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Trek’s cheapest Domane remains a bargain bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£775/$1,100/€794 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Poised handling; quality spec; sporty feel</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Handlebar can transmit vibrations</li>\n</ul><p>The Trek Domane AL 2 is the entry-level Domane.
