Speaking to the <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/treasurer-to-force-apple-into-line-20210829-p58mui\"><em>Australian Financial Review</em></a>, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said that the recommendations would be carefully considered:<blockquote>Ultimately, if we do nothing to reform the current framework, it will be Silicon Valley alone that determines the future of our payments system, a critical piece of our economic infrastructure.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUnder current Australian law, the likes of ‌Apple Pay‌ are not classified as payment systems, putting them outside payment regulations. Classifying ‌Apple Pay‌ as a payment system would clarify the regulatory status of digital wallets in Australia and allow the government to explicitly designate big tech companies as payment providers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther recommendations, contingent on classifying ‌Apple Pay‌ as a payment system, look to establish a strategy for the country's wider payments ecosystem with a single, integrated licensing framework.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAustralian banks such as the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia have previously raised concerns around the growth of digital wallets with \"competition issues\" and purported safety implications. Earlier this year, an Australian Parliamentary Committee considered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/26/australia-hears-case-access-iphone-nfc/\">forcing Apple</a> to open up the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s NFC chip to support third-party payment systems in an effort to promote competition.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/australia/\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/australia-continues-apple-pay-scrutiny/\">Australia Continues to Scrutinize Apple Pay Amid Push for Regulation</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/australia-continues-to-scrutinize-apple-pay-amid-push-for-regulation.2309181/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=69TibHTzDcg:-YZNLdqz-Pc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=69TibHTzDcg:-YZNLdqz-Pc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/69TibHTzDcg\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"753b76a6d2666eb3d266d5e662c9b24dabbc00e29d566e20117fdc13db19ed57","category":"Apple"}
