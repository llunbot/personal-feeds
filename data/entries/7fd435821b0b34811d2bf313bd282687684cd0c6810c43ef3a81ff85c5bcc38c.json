It seems intuitiveâ€”EVs have many fewer moving parts than cars that have to detonate small quantities of hydrocarbon fuel thousands of times a minute. But the data don't really bear out the idea. In fact, according to data collected by Consumer Reports, EVs are significantly less reliable than conventionally powered cars.</p>\n<p>CR is known for buying cars for its own test fleet, but for its annual auto reliability survey, the organization cast a wider net. Specifically, it gathered data from 330,000 owners of vehicles from model year 2000 onwards, and it uses that survey data to <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/who-makes-the-most-reliable-cars-a7824554938/#:~:text=We%20study%2020%20trouble%20areas,for%20every%20major%20mainstream%20model.\">generate reliability scores for each vehicle and model year</a>.</p>\n<p>The results are a little inconvenient for the EV evangelist. EVs had 79 percent more reliability problems than a gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicle, on average. Plug-in hybrids fared even worse; these had 146 percent more issues on average than the conventional alternative. But simpler not-plug-in hybrids bucked this trend, with 26 percent fewer reliability problems than conventionally powered vehicles.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987118#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987118&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
