ProMotion was first introduced on the iPhone 13 Pro models in 2021 and remains exclusive to Pro models for now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-15-Pro-Multi-Purpose-button-Mute-Switch-Feature-Green.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1642915504858992641\">tweet</a> today, Young provided a roadmap outlining various display-related technologies coming to future iPhones. Notably, the roadmap indicates that low-power LTPO display technology will be expanded to the standard iPhones in 2025, which Young said will enable ProMotion on these devices, allowing the display to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProMotion would also allow the display to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate. iPhone 13 Pro models can ramp down to 10Hz, while iPhone 14 Pro models can go as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Young-iPhone-Roadmap.png\" alt width=\"612\" height=\"218\" /><div><em>The roadmap starts in 2021 and ends in 2027</em></div>\r<br />\nAll in all, the roadmap suggests that the so-called \"iPhone 17\" and \"iPhone 17 Plus\" will feature ProMotion, and likely an always-on display too. Apple has routinely expanded Pro-only features to standard models over time, such as OLED technology, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/18/dynamic-island-all-iphone-15-models-rumor/\">Dynamic Island is also expected to expand</a> to all four iPhone 15 models later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYoung also outlined when Apple will adopt under-screen Face ID and cameras in future iPhones, which we discuss in more detail <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/\">in a separate story</a>. Over the past few years, the analyst has accurately leaked many display-related details about future Apple products, including ProMotion coming to the iPhone 13 Pro and MacBook Pro, the sixth-generation iPad mini featuring a larger 8.3-inch display, and much more.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/promotion/\">ProMotion</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/promotion-standard-iphones-2025/\">120Hz ProMotion Rumored to Expand to Non-Pro iPhones in Two Years</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/120hz-promotion-rumored-to-expand-to-non-pro-iphones-in-two-years.2385765/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b333721aa0d775e75c1747e16f2d173fffd6bcdc97e34e4fe2be3208d98eb6e7","category":"Apple"}
