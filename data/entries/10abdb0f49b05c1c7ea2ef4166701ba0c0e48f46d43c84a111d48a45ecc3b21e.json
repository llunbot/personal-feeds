We’ll come on to each of these parts of a frame.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/\">Full-suspension mountain bikes</a> have a floating linkage between the front and rear triangles, with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">rear-suspension system</a> to allow controlled movement between the two.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hardtail-mountain-bikes/\">Hardtail mountain bikes</a> rely on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-suspension-forks/\">suspension fork</a> for their bounce, combined with a rigid rear end.</p>\n<h2>Bike frame tube names explained</h2>\n<h3>Down tube</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"How to measure a down tube\" title=\"How to measure a down tube\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The down tube runs from the head tube to the bottom bracket.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The down tube is the part of the bike frame that slopes down from the head tube at the front of the bike to the bottom bracket, which houses the crankset. It’s the backbone of the bike’s strength.</p>\n<h3>Top tube</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Top tube measurement demonstrated on a bike frame\" title=\"Top Tube length\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The top tube runs from the head tube to the seat tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As its name suggests, the top tube runs along the top of the bike frame’s front triangle, from the top of the head tube to the top of the seat tube. Originally horizontal, it’s now more common for it to have a slope from front to back, particularly on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike/\">mountain bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bikes</a>, the slope results in a frame designated as ‘compact’ or ‘semi-compact’, depending how much of a slope there is.</p>\n<h3>Seat tube</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Seat tube length\" title=\"Seat tube length\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The seat tube runs from the top tube to the bottom bracket.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The seat tube runs from the bottom bracket up to the seatpost, at the rear of the bike’s front triangle. It may be straight or have a kink in it and some have a cut-out section at the rear to fit around the back wheel, allowing the chainstays to be kept shorter.</p>\n<h3>Head tube</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"How to measure a headtube\" title=\"How to measure a headtube\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The head tube runs from the headset bearings at the top to the fork at the bottom.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The head tube is the short tube at the font of the frame, which supports the headset bearings that keep the fork in place.</p>\n<h3>Seatstays</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"How to measure a chainstay\" title=\"How to measure a chainstay\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The seatstays connect the seat tube to the chainstays.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The two seatstays connect to the seat tube at one end and the chainstays at the other, to support the rear wheel. They’re typically skinny, to help add comfort at the rear of the bike. If a bike has rim brakes, there’s often a bridge between the two seatstays to support the rear brake caliper.</p>\n<h3>Chainstays</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Chainstay length\" title=\"Chainstay length\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Chainstays run between the bottom bracket and seatstays.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The two chainstays run from the frame’s bottom bracket to the rear of the bike, where they meet up with the seatstays and support the rear wheel.

They consist of a central skewer with a cam lever at one end and an adjusting nut at the other to hold them in place in the frame drop-outs, and are commonly used on rim-brake bikes.</p>\n<p>Thru-axles are now nearly ubiquitous on disc-brake bikes. They tighten into circular apertures in the frame, with one end being threaded so that you can tighten the bolt in the frame. Thru-axles give more precise positioning between the frame and the wheel than quick-release skewers.</p>\n<p>Some wheel axles have threads at either end and are secured to the frame with nuts. You’ll find them on track bikes and some <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-fixies-and-singlespeed-bikes/\">fixed-gear bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning, though, that the term ‘axle’ is actually a bit of a misnomer in these cases. Strictly speaking, none of these bolts or skewers are actually axles, because they are not designed to bear any vertical load. Their primary function is to instead provide a clamping force to ensure a secure connection between the wheel and frame.</p>\n<p>Want to know more?

Steel ball bearings are the most common; the balls may be loose in the bearing, but sealed bearings, where the balls and races are constructed in a single unit, are common.</p>\n<p>More expensive bearings may use ceramic balls instead of steel. It is said that <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/ceramic-bearings/\">ceramic bike bearings</a> are harder, so they wear better and their dimensions can be made more accurate to reduce friction.</p>\n<p>You’ll also find roller bearings or needle bearings used in some components, where balls are replaced with cylindrical rollers.</p>\n<h2>Headset</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Headset bearings\" title=\"Headset bearings\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bearings help keep the headset turning.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Benedict Pfender / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Your bike’s headset consists of the bearings at the top and bottom of the frame’s head tube, which support the fork and allow it to turn in the frame.</p>\n<p>They’re important bearings because they need to allow you to turn smoothly, but without play between the fork and the frame, which would affect the bike’s handling.</p>\n<p>Most headsets now have a wider-diameter bearing at their bottom than their top to improve steering accuracy, although older bikes and some retro-style bikes still have the same narrower bearing diameter top and bottom.</p>\n<p>Bearings on older bikes were threaded too, whereas newer ones press into the frame.</p>\n<hr /><h2>Finishing kit parts</h2>\n<h3>Seatpost</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"27.2mm seatpost on the 2022 Vitus Venon prototype road bike\" title=\"27.2mm seatpost on the 2022 Vitus Venon prototype road bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A seatpost extends from the seat tube and holds the saddle in place.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/seatposts/\">seatpost</a> protrudes from the top of the bike frame’s seat tube and supports your saddle.</p>\n<p>At the top of the seatpost is a head with bolts to hold the saddle in place.

There are a variety of different <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/disc-brake-pads/\">disc brake pad materials</a> used, depending on cycling discipline.</p>\n<p>The main alternative to disc brakes is rim brakes, where pads are pushed against the wheel rim via a cable from the brake lever. Rim brakes are lighter, but generally less powerful and consistent than <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road disc brakes</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/disc-brake-rotors/\">Disc-brake rotors</a> are typically made of steel, but may include a layer of aluminium sandwiched between steel faces. They’re attached to the wheels either using six bolts or the Centerlock system, which uses splines and a locknut.</p>\n<p>The rotor may include cooling fins and it may be made in one piece or be floating, where the braking surface is attached to a separate carrier spider, so it’s less likely to warp as it gets hot and expands.</p>\n<p>Rotors come in a variety of diameters, from 140mm to 203mm, with larger rotors used where more intense braking is needed, such as for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downhill-mountain-bikes/\">downhill mountain bikes</a>.</p>\n<h3>Rim brakes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The Mango OG 2X8 road bike is equipped with Veetire Rolldiac tyres and Tektro R315 rim brakes\" title=\"Mango OG 2X8 - 03\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rim brakes were previously one of the most popular braking options for the road.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While disc brakes are almost universal on mountain bikes and high-end road bikes, rim brakes are still specced on many cheaper road bikes and hybrid bikes.</p>\n<p>Rim brake calipers are mounted to a bike’s frame. The calipers press brake pads onto the brake path on the rim of a wheel to slow it down.</p>\n<p>Side-pull caliper brakes are the most common form of rim brake and still prove to be one of the lightest options for braking.</p>\n<p>Rim brakes are usually actuated by a cable pulled by a lever on the handlebars, which in turn pulls the caliper closed.</p>\n<p>Hydraulic rim brakes do exist, with brands such as Magura providing options that use a similar system to its disc brakes.</p>\n<p>Brake paths on wheel rims are usually made of a hard-wearing material, though this can wear down over time and lead to rim failure if not recognised.</p>\n<p>Rim brakes are not as effective as disc brakes in wet weather conditions, with carbon fibre rims affected substantially.</p>\n<p>This is due to groundwater being easily transferred onto the brake path, which can also lead to grit being lodged into the brake pads.</p>\n<h3>Cantilever brakes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"GT Malverns Classic 2022 - Dave Yates DONKIS NOB\" title=\"20220828malvern2324\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cantilever brakes were a staple of 90s mountain biking.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Cantilever brakes are almost extinct, with the veteran brake featuring on some budget mountain bikes and hybrids.</p>\n<p>Cantilever brakes – or ‘cantis’ – operate in a similar way to rim brakes by squeezing the rim of the wheel of the bike to slow it down.</p>\n<p>In the past, the system was one of the few solutions for riders who needed to run wider tyres on their bike and was the go-to brake design for mountain biking and cyclocross.</p>\n<p>Cantilever brakes suffer the same issues as rim brakes, with rain and grit affecting the braking surface and losing power.</p>\n<h3>Gear shifters</h3>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2022/01/Shimano-XTR-M9100-mountain-bike-groupset-15-72e987b.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Shimano XTR M9100 mountain bike groupset\" title=\"Shimano XTR M9100 mountain bike groupset-15\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Mountain bike gear shifters are seperate from the brakes.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2022/05/shimanoultegradi2r8100russburton011-1-a001b4a.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Shimano Ultegra R8100 groupset – shifters and brakes\" title=\"Shimano Ultegra R8100 groupset – shifters and brakes\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Road and gravel bike shifters are integrated with the brake levers.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Your shifters enable you to change gear up or down and adjust your effort levels to suit the terrain.</p>\n<p>They’re mostly mounted on the handlebar, and there’s usually one that operates the rear derailleur and one that operates the front derailleur, if you have one.</p>\n<p>It’s most common for them to be connected to the derailleurs by wire cables, although electronic groupsets can be found on pricier bikes.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The shifters on the Raleigh TI 40th Anniversary edition are on the down-tube\" title=\"Raleigh TI 40th Anniversary edition\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Modern shifters have come on a lot from down-tube levers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>MTB and hybrid bike shifters are separate from the brake levers, although they can share a common mount to the handlebars.
