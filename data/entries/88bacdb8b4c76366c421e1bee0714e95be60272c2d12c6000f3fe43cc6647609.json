Yet with refined suspension design, the addition of 29er or mullet wheel options for every bike, in-frame storage, and integrated KIS steering stabilizers, the new Spectral trail bike is just as capable as ever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been riding the new bike for a couple of weeks, and it strikes an interesting balance between the best characteristics of the previous generation Spectral 29er, Spectral Mullet, Spectral 125 &amp; Spectral K.I.S with a couple of new bits thrown in too. So is it a better trail bike than any of those four different, or something of a happy medium in between?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 Canyon Spectral CF do-it-all carbon trail mountain bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Spectral CF, all-new 140mm travel carbon trail all-mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike-2048x1229.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At a quick glance, the new Canyon Spectral CF looks a lot like the old bike. Even the geometry table is almost exactly the same.

The Mullet was more of a snappy, burly bike that wanted to ride jump lines. The 125 was the playful, poppy mini-enduro bike for riders looking to push hard on less technical trails. And the K.I.S. was a bike for the tech-savvy rider trying to eke a bit extra control out of their climbs and a tad more speed on the loose descents. I found something to really like in each of those bikes. But for riders just looking for a capable mountain bike to, you know, go mountain biking… it was too many options and too complicated of a choice. So Canyon set out to make one Spectral that did everything that four different Spectrals did before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the new 2024 Canyon Spectral CF…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new with shorter 140mm of suspension travel?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_angled.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_angled.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Spectral CF 140mm carbon trail mountain bike, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_angled.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_angled-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_angled-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_angled-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_angled-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_angled-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_angled-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This new Canyon Spectral CF is now a 140mm travel bike, paired with 150mm forks. (Actually, it looks like 139mm for a 29er, or 142mm for a mullet based on Canyon’s suspension graphs.) That amounts to 10mm less travel front &amp; rear than the original Spectrals (obviously still more than the 125), but what Canyon thinks is a better sweet spot for a modern trail bike. And it makes for clearer differentiation between this trail Spectral and the proper enduro race Strive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Update Suspension Kinematics</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_absolute-leverage-ratios.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_absolute-leverage-ratios.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Spectral CF, all-new 140mm travel carbon trail all-mountain bike, leverage ratio\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_absolute-leverage-ratios.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_absolute-leverage-ratios-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_absolute-leverage-ratios-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_absolute-leverage-ratios-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_absolute-leverage-ratios-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_absolute-leverage-ratios-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_relative-leverage-ratios.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_relative-leverage-ratios.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Spectral CF, all-new 140mm travel carbon trail all-mountain bike, leverage ratio relatively speaking\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_relative-leverage-ratios.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_relative-leverage-ratios-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_relative-leverage-ratios-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_relative-leverage-ratios-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_relative-leverage-ratios-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_relative-leverage-ratios-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But to make a bit less travel feel just as capable, Canyon revamped the new Spectral CF’s suspension. The bike now gets a more linear, flatter shock leverage curve that means more support in the mid-travel for better pedaling efficiency, still with progressive support as you push to the end of the bike’s travel. Interestingly, putting the new 140mm 29er bike curve against the old 150mm 29er, the difference isn’t super pronounced per mm of travel. But looking at how the leverage changes as a ratio of its whole travel, it clearly more progressive for the 29er, and then actually a bit less linear but a higher leverage ratio for the 27.5/29″ mullet build.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-squat.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-squat.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Spectral CF, all-new 140mm travel carbon trail all-mountain bike, anti-squat\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-squat.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-squat-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-squat-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-squat-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-squat-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-squat-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon also made a pretty key suspension kinematics tweak to Anti-Squat that’s easy to overlook. Remember, Anti-Squat is essentially how much pedaling input stiffens up the suspension to efficiently put the power down. By slightly raising the back of the Horst-link pivot on the chainstay and lowering the rocker link, the new has about 5% less anti-squat when you are in the easiest hill-climbing gear, but a full 25-30% less anti-squat in the going fast downhill gears. That means you don’t noticeably lose pedaling efficiency while climbing steep terrain. But the suspension is noticeably more supple/active while descending at high speed, even when you are stomping on the pedals. Canyon says their internal testing was unanimous in favor of the benefits of less anti-squat up to a certain point without a perceived loss in efficiency. So that’s where they put it to get a more plush ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-rise.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-rise.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Spectral CF, all-new 140mm travel carbon trail all-mountain bike, anti-rise\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-rise.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-rise-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-rise-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-rise-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-rise-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_anti-rise-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Anti-rise (or braking influence on suspension) remains mostly the same, with the new Spectral flanking the outgoing bike depending on your choice of rear wheel size.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tweaked geometry and Extra Small size</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_geometry.jpg\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_geometry.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Spectral CF, all-new 140mm travel carbon trail all-mountain bike, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_geometry.jpg 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_geometry-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_geometry-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_geometry-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_geometry-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_geometry-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-Canyon-Spectral-CF_all-new-140mm-travel-carbon-trail-all-mountain-bike_geometry-2048x1024.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Geometry is effectively the same as the previous model with a 64° head angle.

Thanks to a flip-chip at the back of the chainstay, every bike can run a 27.5 or 29″ rear wheel. With an 8mm change to chainstay length and the appropriate shift in the BB height. Before, the mullets and 29ers shared the same front triangle but required different rear triangles to adapt to different wheel sizes. Now, when you go to buy any spec of the new 2024 Spectral, Canyon lets you pick which rear wheel size you prefer. (Only the new XS size is mullet only, since the 29er wheel would rub the seat tube at full compression.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Internal (and external) frame storage</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_Load-System-in-frame-storage-on-clean-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_Load-System-in-frame-storage-on-clean-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Spectral CF 140mm carbon trail mountain bike, Load System in-frame storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_Load-System-in-frame-storage-on-clean-bike.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_Load-System-in-frame-storage-on-clean-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_Load-System-in-frame-storage-on-clean-bike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_Load-System-in-frame-storage-on-clean-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_Load-System-in-frame-storage-on-clean-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_Load-System-in-frame-storage-on-clean-bike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_Load-System-in-frame-storage-on-clean-bike-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it gets in-frame Load System storage too. A glovebox door under the bottle cage opens up with enough room to stuff a small bag with all your regular trailside repair kit. There’s also enough space to stuff a packable shell jacket in there as well. I was able to push the Canyon bag with a spare butyl inner tube, tire levers, a CO2 cartridge &amp; inflator far enough up the downtube that I also fit a full-size hooded wind shell.

The idea is you can easily secure a mini-tool carrier with one bolt. Then still have the other pair for a mini bolt-on bag. Sometimes you just don’t want to dig into a bike’s glovebox to adjust a brake lever or seatpost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also the option to print your own multi-tool holder for the stem if you have access to a 3D printer! “<em>Also piloted as part of this launch will be an innovative ‘print at home’ stem-mounted Minitool holder.

It has an interesting effect of balancing your turns equally with the front &amp; rear wheels, and simply helping keep the bars straight when pinballing down through a rock garden. It genuinely is a system to get used to. But by and large, it seems like potential to improve the ride of beginner and expert mountain bikers alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Canyon is going fully onboard with the KIS concept. And every new Spectral gets it integrated inside the top tube – at no additional cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Syntace-KIS-steering-stabilizer-reimagines-MTB-handling_KIS-system-inside-the-Canyon-Spectral-X-ray-jpg.webp\"><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Syntace-KIS-steering-stabilizer-reimagines-MTB-handling_KIS-system-inside-the-Canyon-Spectral-X-ray-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Syntace KIS steering stabilizer reimagines MTB handling, Canyon internal x-ray\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This version is tuned down a bit with a softer spring that most trail riders will find less obtrusive, while still obvious. Set it at its lowest tension (which I think is how it arrives out of the box) and you are likely to forget that it’s there. Or dial it up to max power and it feels more like I experienced on that <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-ride-canyon-spectral-kis-adds-light-steering-stabilizer-to-climb-descend-faster/\" target=\"_blank\">first KIS-equipped bike</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m fully willing to ride with KIS to see how it changes the feel of my local trails. But if you decide you don’t want it, it’s easy enough for a competent home mechanic to remove. And Canyon includes a blank cover plate with the bike in case you choose to ditch it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Other small improvements to the new Canyon Spectral</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_clean-mud-flap.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_clean-mud-flap.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Spectral CF 140mm carbon trail mountain bike, clean mud flap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_clean-mud-flap.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_clean-mud-flap-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_clean-mud-flap-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_clean-mud-flap-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_clean-mud-flap-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_dirty-mud-flap.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_dirty-mud-flap.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Spectral CF 140mm carbon trail mountain bike, dirty mud flap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_dirty-mud-flap.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_dirty-mud-flap-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_dirty-mud-flap-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_dirty-mud-flap-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_dirty-mud-flap-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the biggest upgrade for the new Canyon Spectral in my own riding is this 2-part rubber flap fender. It bridges over the point where the swingarm connects with the mainframe. The mud flap keeps dirt, mud, rocks, pine needles, and other trail debris from getting stuck in between the front &amp; rear halves of the frame where they could wreak havoc. It also gets improved chainstay and downtube protector coverage with a new stick-on damped soft rubber material.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_1-piece-rocker-link.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_1-piece-rocker-link.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon Spectral CF 140mm carbon trail mountain bike, 1-piece rocker link\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_1-piece-rocker-link.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_1-piece-rocker-link-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_1-piece-rocker-link-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_1-piece-rocker-link-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_1-piece-rocker-link-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_1-piece-rocker-link-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/New-Canyon-Spectral_revamped-downsized-140mm-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_1-piece-rocker-link-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond that, the modified suspension layout also comes with a one-piece rocker link that improves suspension torsional stiffness.

I have enjoyed the plush mid-stroke feel of the new bike. And I’ve not yet felt like the bike was lacking for its slightly reduced travel.
