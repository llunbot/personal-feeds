Savings enables\nApple Card users to grow their Daily Cash rewards with a Savings\naccount from Goldman Sachs, which offers a high-yield APY of 4.15\npercent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-the-partnership-between-apple-and-goldman-soured?rc=jfy0lk\">in The Information</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As of earlier this year, the Apple Card had roughly 10 million\nusers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the figure,\nwhich hasn’t been previously reported.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That works out to a nice even $1,000 average per Apple Card user. I’m guessing though, that the <em>median</em> is much lower, and the mean average is $1,000 because a smaller number of users have transferred large amounts to take advantage of the 4.15 percent interest rate. (I currently get 3.93 percent from TD Bank, so I just use my Apple Card savings account for my cash back rewards.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/03/apple-card-savings\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"19064cd2ea379fd0357b087cfcb942c3171f23dc061b36bbf6f6425e6dd8a45e","category":"Tech"}
