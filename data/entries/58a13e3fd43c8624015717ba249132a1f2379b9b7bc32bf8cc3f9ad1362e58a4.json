But whales and other marine mammals like seals also help in this regard by releasing tons of nutrient-rich fecal matter into those waters. Now we can add whale urine to that list, according to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56123-2\">a paper</a> published in the journal Nature Communications.</p>\n<p>“Lots of people think of plants as the lungs of the planet, taking in carbon dioxide, and expelling oxygen,” <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1075950?\">said co-author Joe Roman</a>, a biologist at the University of Vermont. “For their part, animals play an important role in moving nutrients. Seabirds transport nitrogen and phosphorus from the ocean to the land in their poop, increasing the density of plants on islands. Animals form the circulatory system of the planet—and whales are the extreme example.”</p>\n<p>Back in 2010, Roman co-authored <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013255\">a study</a> in which they examined field measurements and population data to determine that whales and seals could be responsible for replenishing 2.3×104 metric tons of nitrogen per year in the Gulf of Maine alone. Specifically, they feed in deeper waters and then release \"flocculent fecal plumes\" (i.e., feces) at the surface, serving as a kind of \"whale pump\" that boosts plankton growth, among other tangible benefits.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-whale-urine-benefits-the-ocean-ecosystem/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-whale-urine-benefits-the-ocean-ecosystem/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"58a13e3fd43c8624015717ba249132a1f2379b9b7bc32bf8cc3f9ad1362e58a4","category":"Tech"}
