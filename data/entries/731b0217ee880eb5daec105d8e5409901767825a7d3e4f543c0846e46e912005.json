{"title":"Appleman Introduces 2XR Direct Mount Chainrings and Spiders","link":"https://bikerumor.com/appleman-2xr-direct-mount-chainrings-spiders-road-gravel/","date":1741014007000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GRX-Chainrings-P1110479-Large.webp\" width=\"1280\" height=\"855\" alt=\"Appleman GRX Chainrings spider\" /></p>\n<p>Matt Appleman developed the 2XR direct mount chainrings and spiders to bring near-universal drivetrain compatibility to Appleman Bicycles’ beautifully manufactured 2XR crankset. What differentiates the 2XR crankset from its high-end competitors is the availability of lengths as short as 100mm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you read that correctly. Appleman has put a huge amount of <a href=\"https://www.applemanbicycles.com/resources/riders-guide-to-crank-length/\">thought and work into this subject</a> of crank length. Even as someone who can’t imagine ditching my 172.5mm crank arms, I find his reasoning sound and the subject fascinating as part of the larger subject of bike fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to their short-length options and stunning looks, the 2XR cranks have been a hit in the custom bike world. At the same time, drivetrain tolerances are becoming tighter and compatibility more specific. For Appleman, it was clear that in this age of hyper-specific drivetrain specs, a menu of spiders and a do-it-all 1x direct mount ring were key to ensuring that the 2XR crankset would have a home on any bike and work perfectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Appleman 2XR Direct-Mount Chainrings</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Orange-Chainring-Splatter-P1110354-Large.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"855\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Orange-Chainring-Splatter-P1110354-Large.webp\" alt=\"Appleman chainring orange splatter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Orange-Chainring-Splatter-P1110354-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Orange-Chainring-Splatter-P1110354-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Orange-Chainring-Splatter-P1110354-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Orange-Chainring-Splatter-P1110354-Large-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Orange-Chainring-Splatter-P1110354-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Orange-Chainring-Splatter-P1110354-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-Detail-P1110475-Large.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"855\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-Detail-P1110475-Large.webp\" alt=\"appleman chainring detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-Detail-P1110475-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-Detail-P1110475-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-Detail-P1110475-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-Detail-P1110475-Large-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-Detail-P1110475-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-Detail-P1110475-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-P1110469-Large.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-P1110469-Large.webp\" alt=\"appleman direct mount chainring 28t\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-P1110469-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-P1110469-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-P1110469-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-P1110469-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-P1110469-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-28t-P1110469-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-38t-P1110454-Large.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-38t-P1110454-Large.webp\" alt=\"Appleman direct mount chainring 38\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-38t-P1110454-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-38t-P1110454-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-38t-P1110454-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-38t-P1110454-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-38t-P1110454-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-38t-P1110454-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Appleman 2XR Chainrings ensure clean looks and easy fitment for gravel and mountain 1x drivetrains.

A full range of spiders means that whether you ride a gravel bike with 12-speed Shimano GRX, a track bike, or anything in between, there is a spider that will work with your chainring(s), and allow you to run a 2XR crank. All spiders can accommodate 1x and 2x setups, and like all Appleman products, can be adjusted and swapped with a 5mm Allen. The 2XR spiders are manufactured in the USA and made from 2024 Aluminum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Spider Options: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>110×5:</em> A spider for road and gravel bikes and chainrings. For use with both 1x and 2x configurations. (Compatible with Praxis 48×32 tooth sub compact chainrings.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>GRX Spider:</em> Compatible with Shimano’s GRX chainrings. It allows you to swap chainrings from a GRX crankset. Supplied with 8 chainring bolts that fit this spider.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>110×4 Shimano Style:</em> A spider has an asymmetric 4-bolt pattern popularized by Shimano road groupsets. It fits 11 and 12-speed Shimano rings and many other aftermarket branded chainrings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>104×4:</em> A spider for mountain through fat bikes for mountain bike chainrings. Chainring can be mounted either inside or outside, depending on chainline requirements. (Compatible with Gates Belt Drive 104×4 chainrings)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>130×5:</em> An oldie but a goodie. Some folks are still using 130×5 chainring or 130×5 Gates belt drive… this is the spider for that!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>144×5 V2: A spider for track bikes and chainrings. This spider has a conventional chainring mounting interface and uses standard chainring bolts (not included). Features extra material for maximal strength and stiffness.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-42t-P1110490-Large.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-42t-P1110490-Large.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-42t-P1110490-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-42t-P1110490-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-42t-P1110490-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-42t-P1110490-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-42t-P1110490-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-42t-P1110490-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Black-Silver-P1110466-Large.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"855\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Black-Silver-P1110466-Large.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Black-Silver-P1110466-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Black-Silver-P1110466-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Black-Silver-P1110466-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Black-Silver-P1110466-Large-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Black-Silver-P1110466-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Black-Silver-P1110466-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Gold-P1110427-Large.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Gold-P1110427-Large.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Gold-P1110427-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Gold-P1110427-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Gold-P1110427-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Gold-P1110427-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Gold-P1110427-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chainring-Gold-P1110427-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GRX-Spider-P1110488-Large.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GRX-Spider-P1110488-Large.webp\" alt=\"Appleman GRX Chainrings spider on crank\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GRX-Spider-P1110488-Large.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GRX-Spider-P1110488-Large-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GRX-Spider-P1110488-Large-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GRX-Spider-P1110488-Large-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GRX-Spider-P1110488-Large-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GRX-Spider-P1110488-Large-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Pricing and Availability</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Appleman 2XR Spider<em>:  Starting at $125.00 USD</em>, available now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Appleman 2XR Direct Mount Chainring: Starting at $185.00, available now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.applemanbicycles.com\"><em>applemanbicycles.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/appleman-2xr-direct-mount-chainrings-spiders-road-gravel/\">Appleman Introduces 2XR Direct Mount Chainrings and Spiders</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"731b0217ee880eb5daec105d8e5409901767825a7d3e4f543c0846e46e912005","category":"Cycling"}
