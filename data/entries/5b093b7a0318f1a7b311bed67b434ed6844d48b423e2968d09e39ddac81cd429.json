Even at the small levels measured, the ammonia particles from the guano interact with sulfur-based aerosols from ocean algae to start a chemical chain reaction that forms billions of tiny particles that serve as nuclei for water vapor droplets.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/penguin-poop-may-help-preserve-antarctic-climate/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/penguin-poop-may-help-preserve-antarctic-climate/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Bob Berwyn, Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5b093b7a0318f1a7b311bed67b434ed6844d48b423e2968d09e39ddac81cd429","category":"Tech"}
