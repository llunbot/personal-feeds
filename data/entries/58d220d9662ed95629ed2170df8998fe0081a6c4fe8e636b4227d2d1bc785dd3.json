However, the price of the device is likely to exceed 800,000 won in Korea—around $540. This international pricing may indicate that the new ‌iPhone SE‌ could come in at a slightly higher price than the current model, which starts at $429.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrevious reports have indicated that the new model may continue to be priced starting at $429, or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/iphone-se-4-face-id-price-rumor/\">see an increase</a> of around 10 percent. This would place it at about $470. Apple reportedly plans to keep the pricing below $500 in the United States, even if the price does go up slightly. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the ‌iPhone SE‌ is Apple's low-cost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> option, a small price increase would be understandable given the device's expected upgrade to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a>, a more modern all-screen design, OLED, USB-C, and more. The fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ could launch as soon as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/iphone-se-4-expected-to-launch-in-march/\">March 2025</a>. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/\">Naver</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/30/iphone-se-4-could-be-more-expensive/\">iPhone SE 4 Could Be More Expensive</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-could-be-more-expensive.2446401/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"58d220d9662ed95629ed2170df8998fe0081a6c4fe8e636b4227d2d1bc785dd3","category":"Apple"}
