{"title":"MacRumors Giveaway: Win a Leather Briefcase and Set of AirTag Holders From Saddleback Leather Co.","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/macrumors-giveaway-saddleback-leather-co/","date":1628272906000,"content":"For this week's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/giveaway/\">giveaway</a>, we've teamed up with Saddleback Leather Co. to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a <a href=\"https://saddlebackleather.com/leather-briefcase-laptop-bag-fp\">Front Pocket Leather Briefcase</a> and a set of <a href=\"https://saddlebackleather.com/airtag-accessories\">four different AirTag holders</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/saddleback-leather-co-giveaway.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nBags from Saddleback Leather Co., such as the Front Pocket Leather Briefcase that we're giving away, are designed to last a lifetime and come with a 100 year warranty. They're made from a thick full-grain leather that's durable and able to stand up to wear and tear over the years.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Front Pocket Leather Briefcase, which comes in tobacco, chestnut, black, and dark coffee brown, is sized to hold a MacBook and all of the accessories that you might need to carry with it. There's a dedicated laptop pocket that can accommodate up to a 17-inch laptop and a second pocket inside for holding other items.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/saddleback-leather-briefcase.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo front pockets are able to hold an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, cables, wallet, and other accessories, plus there are two additional pockets behind them and another two pockets at the sides. For papers and other small items, there's a quick access rear pocket. To hide your most sensitive items like spare cash or a passport, there's a secret false bottom.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no zippers, magnets, snaps, or buttons on the Front Pocket Leather Briefcase, so there are no breakable components to deal with. The bag is built with buckles, and all of the stress points are reinforced with rivets and hidden polyester strapping.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/saddleback-leather-briefcase-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe briefcase is made from a tough, water resistant full-grain leather and it is stitched with marine-grade polymer thread that's designed to hold up to sun and the elements. Clasps are made from Stainless Steel that Saddleback Leather Co. says can hold more than 700 pounds.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/saddleback-leather-briefcase-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's a leather shoulder strap for carrying the briefcase, but it is also able to convert into a laptop backpack, as demoed in the walkthrough video below.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nThe Front Pocket Leather Briefcase is one of Saddleback Leather Co.'s most premium and spacious offerings, which is why it's priced at $719, but Saddleback Leather Co. has several <a href=\"https://saddlebackleather.com/mens-leather-briefcases-satchels/\">smaller, lighter, and more affordable bags</a> available too. The company also makes a <a href=\"https://saddlebackleather.com/airtag-accessories\">series of AirTag holders</a>, which are its newest product and came out earlier this year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSaddleback Leather Co.'s AirTag holders are <a href=\"https://saddlebackleather.com/airtag-accessories\">priced at $19 to $24</a> and they're made from the same protective full-grain leather that Saddleback bags are made from. There are a huge range of designs, like the <a href=\"https://saddlebackleather.com/leather-airtag-keychain-case-a-k-a-the-rivet/\">eight-sided Rivet</a> and the <a href=\"https://saddlebackleather.com/Leather-AirTag-Keychain-Case-a-k-a-The-Sleeve/\">square-shaped Sleeve</a>, both of which attach to keys, backpacks, bags, and more, plus other fun shapes ranging from <a href=\"https://saddlebackleather.com/leather-air-tag-holder-bull/\">bulls</a> to <a href=\"https://saddlebackleather.com/leather-air-tag-holder-koala/\">koalas</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/saddleback-leather-airtags-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nOther designs include <a href=\"https://saddlebackleather.com/leather-airtag-keychain-case-a-k-a-the-strap/\">the Strap</a> and <a href=\"https://saddlebackleather.com/leather-airtag-case-a-k-a-the-double-loop/\">the Double Loop</a>. The Strap can be used as a keyring or a loop thanks to a longer strip of leather, while the Double Loop has a two-loop design that's ideal for attaching to dog collars, backpack shoulder straps, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/saddleback-leather-airtags-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAll of the AirTag holders have a little pocket where the AirTag is housed, and they all have a discreet design that makes them look more like a simple keychain than an AirTag accessory.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nWe have a Front Pocket Leather Briefcase in the tobacco color and a set of four matching AirTag holders (Rivet, Strap, Double Loop, and Sleeve) to give away to one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
