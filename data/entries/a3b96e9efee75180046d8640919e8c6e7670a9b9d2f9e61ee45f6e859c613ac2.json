Employees will therefore direct customers to the in-store availability of Apple USB-C power adapters and additional Apple-certified USB-C cables to meet the need for multiple charging locations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has used its proprietary Lightning port on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models for over 10 years, but in recent years Apple's Macs and iPads have all transitioned to the more common USB-C charging standard. Pressure to comply with new regulations implemented in Europe reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/apple-iphone-15-lightning-test/\">hastened the company's decision to switch to USB-C for iPhones</a>, however despite its initial reluctance to make the change in 2023, Apple stands to profit enormously from the switch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/kuo-iphone-usb-c-faster-charging-speeds/\">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Apple in March significantly increased the total shipment forecast of its 20W USB-C charger by approximately 120% for the third quarter of this year, and set 20W USB-C charger shipments at about 70 million units for the fourth quarter. Overall, Apple's 20W USB-C charger shipments in 2023 are anticipated to see a significant 30–40% year-on-year growth, amounting to 230–240 million units, thanks to the strong replacement demand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo believes Apple's upcoming ‌iPhone 15‌ series will include <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/kuo-iphone-usb-c-faster-charging-speeds/\">support for faster charging speeds</a> when used with MFi-certified USB-C chargers, including its own 20W Power Adapter, while Leaker ShrimpApplePro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/iphone-15-usb-c-accessories-limited-without-mfi/\">has said</a> that ‌iPhone 15‌ models will only officially support USB-C accessories certified by the Apple Made for ‌iPhone‌ (MFi) program. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/usb-c-power-adapter.jpg\" alt width=\"1400\" height=\"988\" />\r<br />\nMeanwhile Apple supplier Foxconn is said to be producing accessories like EarPods and cables with USB-C connectors that are MFi certified, and Apple is also expected to release a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/usb-c-airpods-pro-no-other-hardware-changes/\">new AirPods Pro USB-C charging case</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt least some of the ‌iPhone 15‌ models could support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/17/iphone-15-faster-charging-speeds/\">charging speeds up to 35W</a>, which would allow for quicker charging with an appropriate power adapter. It is not clear if this is a feature that will be available for all of the ‌iPhone 15‌ models or just the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the current time, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> models can charge at a maximum of around 27W, with the Pro models able to charge a bit faster. An increase to 35W would speed up charging times. If the ‌‌iPhone 15‌‌ models support up to 35W charging, Apple could start recommending its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">30W MacBook Air charger</a> or its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/17/apple-35w-chargers-available-to-order/\">35W Dual USB-C charger</a> for maximum charging speed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOverall, Apple stands to gain significant revenue from USB-C accessory sales as it effectively renders obsolete Lightning accessories already used by hundreds of millions of Apple customers worldwide. With ‌iPhone 15‌ prices <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-pro-models-expected-to-be-more-expensive/\">expected to increase</a>, many customers in the market for a new model this year will also therefore have to brace themselves for the additional financial burden of replacement chargers and cables.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will unveil the ‌iPhone 15‌ series at an event scheduled for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/\">Tuesday, September 12</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.
