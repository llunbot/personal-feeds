They come in all shapes and sizes. So take any shoe review with a grain of salt – just like helmets, gloves, grips, saddles, and pedals, one’s shoe choice is a deeply subjective experience. That being said, I’m going to tell you a bit about my own recent quest for the perfect cycling shoe.</p>\n<p>My journey began when I got my first pair of wide-toebox walking shoes. I purchased a pair of Hokas for working long hours on a cement floor at a bread bakery. It’s been an ever-deepening pursuit of podalic harmony ever since. Altra, Topo, Birkenstock, Viba – all of these brands offer ergonomic footwear that has quieted my barking dogs. Having happy feet improves my life in a fundamental way, so these days I’m prepared to drop a couple bills on a nice pair of shoes that make my brief time on this physical plane slightly more enjoyable.</p>\n<p>But how much should we be willing to spend on comfort?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis7.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis7.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis3.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis3.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Cycling Shoes are Too Narrow</h3>\n<p>The problem is, my feet haven’t been too happy on the bike in a while. During an appointment with professional bike fitter Dave Townsend at Santa Rosa Physical Therapy, I reported my recent toe numbness, which had become a serious problem on longer rides.</p>\n<p>Townsend took the insole out of my shoe, a Giro Rincon, and laid it down on the floor. When he had me place my foot atop the insole, the overlap was immediately noticeable – the widest part of the ball of my foot was roughly a half-inch too wide for the insole. The funny thing is, my feet aren’t even wide (see YO below).</p>\n<p>It would seem that the toe numbness I had been experiencing regularly was a result of cycling shoes that were too narrow. Now began the hunt for a properly wide shoe.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/DSC01254.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/DSC01254.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/DSC01254.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/DSC01254.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"Sidi Physis Review\" /></p>\n<h3>Wide Cycling Shoes are Too Wide</h3>\n<p>After some internet sleuthing, I found my first pair of wide-toebox shoes: the Lake MX21G, a lace-up shoe with classic good looks. I selected the Wide fit. Over the next few weeks, I became acquainted with the roomy feel of the Lake MX21G, a comfortable all-day gravel shoe with a moderately stiff carbon sole.</p>\n<p>I experienced a bit of heel slippage, especially after a full-submersion creek crossing loosened my laces and required a re-tie, but overall, my toes were quite happy with these great-looking shoes from Lake. The only drawback is that there’s so much room in the mid-foot that I felt like I wasn’t efficiently transferring power to the pedals. It felt fine for a casual clip-in shoe, but for performance riding (that is, rides with my fast friends), the MX21G was perhaps a bit too wide for me.</p>\n<p>I was feeling like Goldilocks sampling the bears’ porridge: too hot, too cold… when would I find the cycling shoes that felt <em>just right</em>?</p>\n<p>That’s when the PR person for Sidi reached out and asked if I wanted to try their new XC shoe featuring the Italian manufacturer’s wider Millennium fit. My response: <em>Sì, grazie mille.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/DSC01251.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/DSC01251.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/DSC01251.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/DSC01251.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"Sidi Physis Review\" /></p>\n<h3>Reviewer Bias: My Impression of Sidi</h3>\n<p>Sidi is a legendary cycling brand that, within the past decade, seems to have lost some of its market share in the United States. I simply don’t see them around as often as I used to, and they used to be everywhere. When I first got into cycling, Sidi shoes were hot shit – all the cool cyclocross racers in San Francisco seemed to be rocking well-loved pairs of Sidi Dominators in the post-Y2K era.</p>\n<p>I’ve wanted to try a pair of Sidi shoes for a long time, but I couldn’t ever justify spending big bucks on a pair of shoes. After all, most cycling shoes only last me about a year, and Sidi shoes, with their fancy Italian heritage and apparent quality, always seemed just a bit too pricy for an item that might not last more than twelve months. Plus, Sidi shoes had a reputation for fitting very narrow. Great for hardcore road racers, but not so great for working-class casual bike enthusiasts like myself… or so I thought.</p>\n<p>Both of the aforementioned arguments were called into question when I heard that Sidi had added a new wider-but-not-too-wide fit category, the Millennium Fit, to their 2025 smorgasbord of premium shoes. The pricepoint was still quite high, but so is everything nowadays. I requested a pair of the new XC-focused Sidi Physis. Let the testing begin.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis9.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis9.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Initial Impressions</h3>\n<p>Right out of the box, the Sidi Physis have a lean, mean, race-day appearance. Immediately I knew that the Physis would be more performance-focused, rather than casual ride-focused. When there are threaded cleats intended for toe spikes, you know they mean business.</p>\n<p>The welded TPU upper is a durable-looking matte material that’s easy to wipe clean. There are two ways to fine-tune the fit of the shoe: there’s an offset mid-foot dial system that’s very similar to a Boa, and a Tension Strap at the ankle. The dial has a flip-up handle for tightening – this action is very similar to a fishing reel – and release triggers on either side of the dial for loosening. It takes just a minute to figure out, but it becomes second nature fairly quickly.</p>\n<p>The Tension Strap is essentially a Velcro closure that has plastic sawteeth in a central channel which engage when buckled down to prevent slippage. There are also rubber grippers in the interior heel. In my experience, the unique Sidi dial and Tension Strap worked flawlessly and I was able to find a good, solid fit with zero heel slippage.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_143.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_143.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_143.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_143.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Sidi insole is what I’d consider neutral, with some shaping for arch support. I don’t have high arches, but I’m not flat-footed either. I have come to expect decent insoles from shoes in the $200 and up price range, whereas most insoles in cheaper shoes should be replaced immediately – and good orthotics ain’t cheap! Thankfully, the Sidi insoles are comfortable out of the box and didn’t need to be replaced.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis5.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis5.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis4.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis4.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>My feet usually fit somewhere between a size Men’s US 11.5 to 12 shoe, depending on the manufacturer, which means I usually select a size 46. Sidi recommended that I size down, so I opted for a size 45.5. Again, your mileage may vary, but these were an ideal fit for my feet. I was feeling less like Goldilocks searching for the right porridge and more like Cinderella in the glass slippers.</p>\n<p>So what negatives could I attribute to the shoes? The carbon sole is incredibly stiff, so much so that it feels very similar to a road shoe. With almost no flexibility in the shoe, walking is not advisable. I could still walk when necessary, but wouldn’t relish the idea of extended hike-a-bike sections.</p>\n<p>Again, these are not casual crossover shoes. The Physis is a pure XC shoe that focuses on maximizing power transfer. Great for the types of rides where you want to go fast, not so great for just chilling – but as far as I’m concerned, that’s what flat pedals are for.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_054.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_054.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_054.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_054.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The big glaring negative about these shoes is the price. The Sidi Physis is priced at $399.99. I’m not going to argue that anyone should spend almost four bills on a pair of shoes, and I will point out that comparable models from other shoe companies are priced within the same range.</p>\n<p>The S-Works Recon will run you about $450.00, and the Lake MX238 cost just about $349.99. I’m still not sure if I could lay down that much money on some shoes, but after several years of buying high-end shoes, my Overton window has shifted when it comes to dropping fat stacks on the things that really improve my life.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, enough price shock. I didn’t pay for these shoes, and I shouldn’t evaluate them based on their MSRP because I know many of you wouldn’t bat an eye at this pricepoint. <em>How did they ride?</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The Principle of Self-Unfolding: The Sidi Physis in Action</h3>\n<p>In Greek, the word <em>physis</em> is a philosophical, theological, and scientific term, usually translated into English as “nature”. The definition I prefer is “the principle of self-unfolding”; that is, the natural state of a flower blooming, or a seed growing into a plant. How would the Physis shoes change over time? Initially I wondered if there would be a break-in period, as most racy shoes tend to need to loosen up before they become comfortable. Not so with these babies – I felt immediately comfortable on longer rides. The Physis felt <em>natural</em>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_222.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_222.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_222.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_222.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I rode road, gravel, and mountain routes, often finding a mix of all three on every outing. To this date, I’ve covered just over a hundred hard winter miles while wearing the Sidi Physis. They’ve seen puddles and creek crossings, and they have been covered from tongue to tread in some of Sonoma County’s muddiest mud.</p>\n<p>So far they’ve met every benchmark for durability and performance, and I can say without hesitation that these shoes surpass every other shoe I’ve owned in terms of comfort while pedaling. They feel like <em>quality</em>, and I think they look hella fine too.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_241.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_241.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_241.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Sidi-Physis-Review_241.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>They also surpass every other shoe I’ve owned in terms of price, by about double. At four hundred clams, are they worth it? In complete honesty: As much as I love these shoes, I’m not sure if I could stomach paying full retail for them. They make my feet very happy, but they would put my wallet in serious pain. Thankfully, there will be several more affordable and highly attractive upcoming options in Sidi’s lineup (such as the <a href=\"https://sidi.com/products/motus-military-3\" target=\"_blank\">Motus</a> and <a href=\"https://sidi.com/products/asper-laces-military-1\" target=\"_blank\">Asper Laces</a>), which also feature the Millennium fit.</p>\n<p>If the Physis appeals to you, there’s a very good chance that your local bike shop can order them for you. Since Sidi is now available through QBP, pretty much any shop with a Q account can order Sidi for their customers. It’s actually kind of a big deal for a small retailer to be able to carry high-end, comfortable cycling shoes that can compete with the big brands, and I think Sidi can easily go toe-to-toe with any modern performance shoe thanks to their new Millennium fit.</p>\n<p>Looking at their current line-up, I have to say that I regret waiting this long to ride in a pair of Sidi shoes. In my eyes, this brings Sidi back to the front of the pack.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SidiPhysis2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<p>Featuring Sidi’s new Millennium fit, the Sidi Physis offer a well-designed, premium XC shoe at a premium price. For a casual shoe, look elsewhere. For an incredibly stiff, performance-oriented shoe that hits the sweet spot between too narrow and too wide, the Sidi Physis are worth a closer look.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Classic Italian good looks in a modern package</li>\n<li>New Millennium fit is wider but not too wide</li>\n<li>Offered in a wide range of sizes, including many half sizes</li>\n<li>Stiff sole improves pedaling performance</li>\n<li>Made in the EU</li>\n<li>Available through QBP</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stiff sole makes walking uncomfortable</li>\n<li>Expensive</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://sidi.com/en-us/products/physis-3?variant=44707128377538\">Sidi</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.jamesnewmanphoto.com\">James Newman</a> for the riding photos of me and Nick Jr.!</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sidi-physis-xc-shoe-review/\">Sidi Physis XC Shoe Review: The Principle of Self-Unfolding</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Nicholas Haig-Arack","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"33baae80853641df1a38ece35d360e83a1ef8d233731dd178086ef9b45f66cb2","category":"Cycling"}
