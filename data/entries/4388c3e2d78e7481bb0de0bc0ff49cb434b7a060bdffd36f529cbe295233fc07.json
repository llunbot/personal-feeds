As part of this change, people who have opted in to our Face Recognition setting will no longer be automatically recognized in photos and videos, and we will delete the facial recognition template used to identify them.  </p>\n\n<p>This change will represent one of the largest shifts in facial recognition usage in the technology’s history. More than a third of Facebook’s daily active users have opted in to our Face Recognition setting and are able to be recognized, and its removal will result in the deletion of more than a billion people’s individual facial recognition templates. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interesting, to say the least. A billion people is <em>lot</em> of data.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/03/facebook-face-recognition\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4388c3e2d78e7481bb0de0bc0ff49cb434b7a060bdffd36f529cbe295233fc07","category":"Tech"}
