Amazon's <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/kindle-colorsoft/\">Colorsoft</a> began shipping on October 30, but shipments were paused after some customers complained about a yellow bar at the bottom of the screen and discoloration around the edges. Amazon is working on a fix and is offering a replacement or refund.</p>\n<p>That's where another problem comes in. Leading up to the launch, Amazon ran a promotion advertising that its customers could trade in their old Kindle for a 20 percent discount on the Colorsoft. And some of those customers are now returning their new Colorsoft due to the yellow bar defectâ€”leaving them without an e-reader altogether. Amazon has yet to provide any concrete information on when the fix will be ready for the Colorsoft and when it will resume shipping.

Once Amazon appraises it, the trade-in value appears in the form of an Amazon gift card. Amazon also offered an additional 20 percent off the Colorsoft along with the trade-in credit.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/faulty-colorsofts-have-left-some-kindle-owners-without-an-e-reader/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/faulty-colorsofts-have-left-some-kindle-owners-without-an-e-reader/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Brenda Stoylar, wired.com","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0359f59092a8a7e18b852696e5f4ff82e75944961c0ac7aadd585c04654f313b","category":"Tech"}
