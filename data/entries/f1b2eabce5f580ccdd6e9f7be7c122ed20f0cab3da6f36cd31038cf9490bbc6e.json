While the YouTube placeholder features a static Apple logo, Apple's Events website includes an animated logo that morphs into a Finder icon, hinting at the subject of the event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has never held a worldwide event at night before, so this is a first for the company. The livestream will begin at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the night before Halloween, which equates to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, 12:00 a.m. in the UK, 1:00 to 2:00 a.m. in other European countries, and 9:00 a.m. in many countries in Asia.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven the late hour of the event, it will be online only, with no in-person component. The \"Scary Fast\" event will be able to be streamed via the Events website, on YouTube, and through the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>MacRumors</em> will have full coverage of the September 12 event as well, both on MacRumors.com and through our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorslive?lang=en\">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple Event</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/\">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-scary-fast-event-livestream/\">Apple Adds 'Scary Fast' Event Livestream Placeholder to YouTube and Website</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adds-scary-fast-event-livestream-placeholder-to-youtube-and-website.2408544/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f1b2eabce5f580ccdd6e9f7be7c122ed20f0cab3da6f36cd31038cf9490bbc6e","category":"Apple"}
